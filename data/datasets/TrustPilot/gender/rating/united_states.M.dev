negative	the ink came in a timely_manner .
negative	i put the cart ledges in my printer and one leaked .
negative	i will never order placebo ink again .
negative	ordered a christmas_present - i was sent the wrong item - returned it - the same wrong item came back - third time i received the right item - in january when it was on sale - and no refund for the return postage !
negative	won_'_t use them again .
negative	your unwillingness to ship to the us_postal systems apo and fpo addresses shows either breathtaking amount of ignorance or is a willful slap in the face to american service members serving overseas .
negative	you have embittered a customer .
negative	my first order arrived with a pack of chicken split_open .
negative	the rest of the order ( some suppliments ) was all covered in blood !
negative	i emailed to let them know and was offered a free chicken , but i still had to place a minimum order of £_00 and pay £ 0 . 00 delivery !
negative	the rest of my order arrived chilled not frozen , with instructions saying the meat was fresh so freeze on the day of delivery , but when i emailed to check on the use by dates i was informed that the meat had previously been frozen and do not re freeze , this is after i have frozen mine as per the previous instruction !
negative	i sent another email_asking what i could do now that it has_been frozen , guess what - silence !!
negative	you guessed it , no reply so basically you are on your own if you need any food safety advice !
negative	take my advice , buy fresh meat from your local butcher , at_least you know the history of your food , and there is somebody who will answer your questions !
negative	!
negative	wrong_size was sent and to return item would '_ve been $_000 to send back item since superdry does not pay for return postage .
negative	just wasted $_00
negative	the original order for glasses was back ordered / out of stock for over a month .
negative	when i changed it in order to speed up the process for needed glasses that took 0 plus weeks and the glasses were too big .
negative	reordered again and had to keep emailing to see where the new ones were .
negative	lost 00_% due to restocking lenses .
negative	just an awful experience .
negative	shop online somewhere_else .
negative	my wife made the mistake of believing that the reservation_counter website was actually the holiday_inn website that she usually uses .
negative	to book my reservation for three nights direct with holiday_inn would have cost us with all taxes , blah , blah , blah exactly $_000 . 00 .
negative	booking the exact_same room with reservation_counter cost us $_000 . 00 , a difference of $_00 . 00 .
negative	.
negative	.
negative	for the pleasure of using a spurious website cleverly disguised as the " real holiday_inn " website .
negative	the counter person at the holiday_inn said this has happened before to other holiday_inn customers .
negative	i ordered several items which shipped in four parts .
negative	the first , an expansion_tank , was the only_thing that arrived , inside the box was some sort of " u " shaped bracket .
negative	how anybody could_possibly mistake that for an expansion_tank is amazing .
negative	on the second part i didn_'_t put the apartment number on the order , i tried to contact partsgeek and i could not get a person on the phone to make a change .
negative	then ups , after failing to deliver it , said they had instructions from the shipper to return it to them so although i called and spoke with ups to try to get it delivered to me they sent it back to partsgeek .
negative	i called partsgeek and was on hold two_separate times for 00_minutes only to get an_automated message_telling_me they were busy and then it hung_up on me .
negative	then i called at 0 : 00 pacific time and got a message that they were closed .
negative	also , the order was returned by the shipper to partsgeek , five days ago and they still have not contacted me in any way to arrange to have it re - shipped or to return my money .
negative	i have never had such horrible service from any parts dealer , and i have ordered from quite a few .
negative	i '_ve ordered from these_guys a few_times , only to be disappointed by their customer service and slow shipping each time .
negative	i did not receive confirmation of my order and i received some of the items in 0 different shipments .
negative	i emailed customer service 0 days ago and have not heard from anyone .
negative	i don_'_t have a copy of my order and that is what i asked for .
negative	each time we got off the bus we had to wait over 00_mins for the next one to arrive , i had to phone twice to see where they were to be told there had been an accident and were trying to get to us .
negative	the original bus_tour managed to get through and 0 buses passed us while we waited for one , it was very very cold and wasted so much of our time very dissapointed .
negative	i have emailed and called them for almost ten times .
negative	i still cannot get any responses so_far .
negative	horrible service !!!
negative	don_'_t buy anything from this company !
negative	i purshased a part , and after i purshased it ( 0 min later i need to canx ) found out it was the wrong part ( received email from parts_geek ).
negative	call customer service - no answer , the only correspondence was through emails ( which took days ).
negative	part was shipped - i had to send back " return ot sender ".
negative	this is a very unprofessional way of doing_business
negative	the price of the bottle was gbp 000 ; grand total ( with insurance , delivery ...) gbp 000 .
negative	the bottle was leakage .
negative	only reaction of whonl .
negative	" we check all bottles " or " will fail while in transit " or " we do state this in our terms and conditions ".
negative	i payed gbp 00 ,- for insurance - no reaction .
negative	result : i get a damaged bottle - i bear the risk - whonl .
negative	only makes the profit .
negative	according to german law this would not be possible .
negative	i received the order for a driver '_s side_rear_view_mirror for a 0000_toyota yaris .
negative	the order was received with a " manual " mirror vice " automatic " mirror .
negative	the order process did not allow for the choice .
negative	the order was sent ( per the packaging label ) to 00000 boyette road , riverview , fl_00000 .
negative	however , the address i am at which is the address ordered for is 00000 timberlake road , riverview , fl_00000 .
negative	the order was received without the cable from the mirror to the car .
negative	a totally_unacceptable experience .
negative	00 / 00 / 0000 .
negative	i questioned a few of the " highland_titles " claims and swiftly received email responses that were well written , polite and skirted each of my concerns skillfully .
negative	my questions centred around the notion of attaching the descriptor , " laird " ( let_alone lord or lady ) to the ' owner ' of one square foot of scotland and to the conservation aspects of the " highland_titles " business .
negative	the emails flew thick and fast , each one polite and appearing to address my concerns until i sent a copy of an_email i received from , " the court of the lord lyon ".
negative	( the lord lyon is quoted on the " highland_titles " documents but , according to the lord lyon , out of context in such a way as to potentially mislead souvenir plot buyers .)
negative	i have had no response from " highland_titles " since .
negative	the company '_s interest in the conservation of the highlands is not strengthened by the fact that their office is not in scotland but in the channel_islands .
negative	( a tax and to a degree , legal haven ) i have asked for but not received any information with regard to their conservation works other than photographs on their facebook_page .
negative	i read a letter on a website purportedly from a customer named , " lady " something - or - other who claimed to have visited her plot and engaged in tree planting with other joyful " lairds and ladies ".
negative	sadly she said she had planted trees in " glencoe " when in actuality her plot is supposed to be some miles_away on keil hill .
negative	when the letter was questioned on the website , no reply was forthcoming .
negative	the company did however point out and very clearly that i could apply for a full_refund after i receive my documentation , should i not be satisfied with their product .
negative	i have rated the company with one star but i feel obliged to point out that whilst i am not satisfied with , " the product ", their representative [_name removed_] was polite and reasonable to deal with at all times .
negative	because i have had some experience of statements quoted out of context in reference to this company , i will of course be keeping a copy of this review should it '_s wording become muddled in some way , with all the emails i sent and received regarding this matter .
negative	should you like a copy of them email , [ personal information removed_]
negative	you ask me to discuss to you , as i would with a friend , my perception of your services .
negative	my bonding company needs my input for renewing my $ 00m in performance bonds .
negative	i signed with you for my current fico '_s & reports .
negative	when i went to scores , it cleanly showed the ( 0 ) bureaus , side - by - side , with clear , large numbers .
negative	when i try to print from that web_page , i get a cheesy vertical set of numbers with very large options of membership that i already paid for .
negative	i can '_t submit trash like this .
negative	it looks_like something a third tier rip - off would provide .
negative	before i go back t my previous credit_monitoring company & canceling my payment to you , does anyone in your it department have any corrective input ?
negative	this " firm " took over supply without authority and proceeded to harass and lie .
negative	the telephone staff are very very rude and the emails are almost as bad .
negative	they believe they can simply bully you into what they want without a care in the world .
negative	dont even think about going to them ...........
negative	update !!
negative	!
negative	00 months into our 00 month deal they have hiked the price by 00 %!
negative	these_cowboys are just unbelievable .
negative	the price is still the same on the website but it seems they fund this by ripping off existing customers .
negative	one year into our contract and chess are still the biggest mistake we have ever made .
negative	the initial sales_team tell tall tales about high service but lie about contract small_print and horrendous exit claus .
negative	they promised us a seamless switch over on a preset date .
negative	the day came and went with no switch over or any contact from chess .
negative	after numerous chases they gave a further date but no_explanation or apology for the delay .
negative	the new date came and our broadband switched off from the old provider .
negative	chess did not however switch on .
negative	several telephone_calls later at rip_off rates we still didint get anywhere or get any of the call_backs promised .
negative	our whole office lost 0 & 0 / 0 days work ( we work 000_% in the cloud ) before we got connected .
negative	we have made formal complaints but they havent even bothered to respond so we are now going to the ombudsman ( cisas ).
negative	if you are thinking about joining them dont !
negative	if everything goes ok you might be ok but if you depend_on a service dont even think about chess as customer service isnt on their agenda .
negative	a flashy website but that '_s as far as it goes .
negative	high prices and complicated disount code rules .
negative	very slow delivery and poor quality packaging .
negative	beware when things go_wrong the customer service is dreadful and downright rude .
negative	look_elsewhere !
negative	this experience was one of the badest i ever have from mcm my zip_code was wrong twice on two_separate_orders even that i used my shipping address from my saved addresses on my mcm account my conmfirmation had the right zip but who ever package and shipped my orders put the wrong zip_code there fore my orders took_longer to be deliver and what was worse is the in this last order some of the parts came wrong so more delays to finish a project that i have been working since before new year eve i have caalled 0 times to mcm sales and cust .
negative	service one of the persons there even said i was the one that put the wrong info .
negative	even so i got my original print out of the order with the right info .
negative	in it i just finished talking to cust service about those wrong parts i was told they would ship the right one right_away so for now i will wait and hope i get the right ones this time
negative	you created a ticket and no one followed_up on it .
negative	det_første indtryk man_får , når_man ringer til kunde telefonen , er at de er ansatte er studerende der_har et eftermiddags / aften job .

negative	i purchased cat_litter once .
negative	due to bad packing it had to be returned .
negative	they then re - sent it to me .
negative	i will not re - order as i can do better elsewhere .
negative	and their prices are higher_than petco .
negative	but i now suffer from non_- stop harassment to visit mr . chewy wherever i go on the internet .
negative	i hate them .
negative	if they do not remove this offensive advertising , i will sue them .
negative	i spent 0 and a half hours having one tire replaced on my car .
negative	a town and country van that came in after me received 0 tires and an alignment and was done just as my car was done .
negative	manager blamed it on a busy day .
negative	i blame it on poor time management .
negative	employees were seen joking and eating in the garage .
negative	there is no excuse for taking so long to replace one tire especially when they knew i was coming in .
negative	i will not return to this location nor will i recommend this location to others .
negative	unacceptable
negative	my flowers was late delivery because they doesn_'_t know before they don_'_t delivery in coquimbo chile .. was really bad_experience for me , never ever buy here again
negative	i ordered a part from partsgeek a month_ago .
negative	i received it a week_later .
negative	they shipped me the wrong part .
negative	i returned the part along with a photo of the right part - a rear_bumper tow hook cover for my 0000 c000 .
negative	i attached a printed brief letter explaining that i wanted the correct part shipped to me .
negative	i received a refund for the part [$ 0 . 00 ] but not the overpriced shipping i paid which was $ 0 . 00 for a plastic part that weighs a few ounces .
negative	my shipping should have been refunded too .
negative	that plus the cost i paid to return the part .
negative	don_'_t waste your time with partsgeek .
negative	i don_'_t even think they are a legitimate company .
negative	i feel scammed .
negative	buyer_beware .
negative	what people do not know is that even_though a flight may have 000 empty seats , travelocity will lead you to believe there are no two seats together , so if you want to sit next to your mate , you have to pay a premium for the seating , only to get on the plane and find out it is empty .
negative	this happened to me coming and going on a recent flight .
negative	seating was assigned through travelocity , but they showed the plane nearly full so i put out the cash to book that last remaining seats together .
negative	the plane was actually so empty , staff advised the passengers they could sit anywhere .
negative	this creates the foundation for a class action law suit .
negative	word to the wise , check before you buy .
negative	website accepted a handful of cds for trade in , totalling £ 0 . 00 .
negative	nine_days_later i receive a pdf voucher for 00p .
negative	i emailed , asking for an explanation .
negative	no response .
negative	five days_later , most of my cds turn up again .
negative	again , no_explanation , and three of them now have half - torn stickers on the cases .
negative	again , i complained , and after chasing again , received a stock reply which claimed most of the cds were too scratched .
negative	the stickers were due to them being labelled , then having them removed .
negative	frankly , this is utter rot .
negative	first , the cds were obviously used but far from ' too heavily scratched '.
negative	in some_cases , they were near - mint .
negative	this is doubly dubious , given the poor condition of stock i have purchased from the shop .
negative	as far as the stickers go , cex shouldn_'_t have labelled the stock - which it didn_'_t own - until it has accepted it .
negative	as such , it was seemingly too much effort for the staff_member to remove properly , each leaving the backing half ripped and stuck to the cases .
negative	overall , cex wasted my time , didn_'_t check the cds carefully , failed to notify me , then , when challenged three_times , fabricated excuses to cover themselves .
negative	none of this is satisfactory and , overall , cex continues to offer a poor service that i shall never use again .
negative	absolutely unacceptable experience
negative	i ordered a reading_glasses suppose to be made in italy ... and you sent me made in china ...$ 000 . 000 made in china ?
negative	your customer service folks could not properly handle a change and gave_me confusing answers .
negative	had to cancel order and go but the clubs at dicks .
negative	.
negative	bought something online .
negative	didn_'_t fit right so swapped for another size in store .
negative	tried to then return to store and refund refused .
negative	contacted ceo twice and eventually got email_telling_me how sad they were and offering refund .
negative	tried to now progress this twice but still no response .
negative	absolutely dreadful
negative	the prices are great , if you can get the correct part .
negative	i gave them the correct ford motor company part number , and they still sent the wrong parts .
negative	their website is dumb .
negative	the grill for the fog_lights is reversed -- they list the one for the right side as left , and vise - versa .
negative	i sent them a picture of the car , and they still could not get it right .
negative	they did send a left_side fog_light , but it had a bolt circle that was too large to fit the grill that was correct for the right side .
negative	i am a bit pissed that i have to pay return shipping for their screw ups .
negative	now had i ordered a wrong part , that would be different , but they fucked up .
negative	waist of time , should of just sold it on ebay !
negative	!
negative	well the only_thing good about this company so_far was there fast service getting the part to me .
negative	yes !
negative	the wrong part and they have no way to get hold of them only to fill_out a slip which they say they will get back to you .
negative	there 0 - 000 free number gives you three choices , but a voice comes on saying there phone_calls are so full they can '_t get back to you .
negative	if you call there regular number some guy_named buster answers saying he is away from his desk to leave message , but then you find out that his message service is full , so i went to my bank and we are doing this the legal way , and they have so many days to get my refund to me or have legal actions take agaisnt them .
negative	if you go online and read the reviews about this company there is no good reviews in there favor , so until i get my refund from them this company sucks !
negative	i purchase 0 meters of 00mm auto flex silicone tube in april of this year , from their ebay site .
negative	i returned the tubing in april this year ( 0000 ), after they confirmed via_email , they would exchange the original tubing , for a 0 meter continues length of the same tubing .
negative	to - date they have not exchange the tubing , will not return my original hose , nor give me a refund or communicate on the matter .
negative	after sending numerous_emails too which they have not responded and phone_calls too which they will not return the call after they say they would .
negative	in desperation , i have had to repurchase another 0 meters of 00mm auto flex silicone tube from this company as i have been able to find anybody_else who can supply the hose to the specification i am require
negative	i have come to the conclusion these_people will not return my original lengths of tubing nor exchange the original tubing , as they originally agreed to do so .
negative	i guess there is no chance of a refund .
negative	the same also applies to ten 00mm silicone tube caps i returned for exchange in march of this year ( 0000 ) after purchasing in february of this year ( 0000 ) still_awaiting an exchange , return or refund .
negative	they send me the same part wice .
negative	i did ordered right and left tie_rod and i got two left and no one has contact me yet , i '_m not happy .
negative	from 0 to 00 my rate is
negative	- 00 i meant very bad .
negative	i waited in all day for an 0 : 00 - 00 : 00 delivery as confirmed by shakespere ( third_party courier ) the day before .
negative	shakespere also promised to call me at_least an_hour before delivery .
negative	at 00 : 00 i called shakespere , was rudely told they were running 0 hours late and they put the phone down on me .
negative	i then rang better_bathrooms to feed this back .
negative	i was told my delivery would definately be with me by 0000 or the hefty delivery charge (£_00 for a bath panel !)
negative	would be refunded .
negative	at 0000 , i rang better_bathrooms back to inform them i was still_waiting and had been all day .
negative	i enquired as to the promised refund only to be told that if i didn_'_t accept a 0000 - 0000 delivery i would have to pay a redelivery fee !
negative	i wasted a whole day .
negative	at best i feel i '_ve been let_down , and at worst i was lied to .
negative	there is no circumstance where i should be required to mail a photo copy of my calif id card and a photo copy of my social_security card
negative	as a condition to do the business that you charged me for .
negative	dont use this you will never win
negative	i called bookit to confirm the hotel i was about to book was in the location i wanted , they confirmed it was .
negative	it was not .
negative	when i asked to cancel , within 0 minutes , they refused .
negative	the supervisor also refused to cancel .
negative	i would not reccommend booking anything with them .
negative	i order two swimsuits totaling_$_00 !
negative	not one was the right size .
negative	unopened and they would not let_me exchange them ...!
negative	i will never ever buy from them again !
negative	horrible experience !
negative	!
negative	non_existent customer service support .
negative	broken parts .
negative	no exchange service or rushed shipping on a replacement part when the fault is clearly theirs for poor packing .
negative	terrible email response times when they even respond .
negative	not up to par with any other parts supplier .
negative	not even close .
negative	my issue is still unresolved .
negative	i tried to return something ... sent it back in september_0000 , even have a receipt by the usps and months later partsjerks say they never received it and won_'_t refund my money .
negative	it took them sometimes well over a week to respond to an_email .
negative	they stalled for so long that it passed the time that i could contest the charge on my credit_card .
negative	these_guys are crooks .
negative	this is the first time i '_ve had a company act as unprofessional as they have .
negative	i will never do_business with them again .
negative	on a better note rockauto is much much_better , more professional and i think better prices .
negative	after waiting 0 week for parts went back on line to find order canceled no email or explantion as to way tried to contact but on line would not accept went to rock_auto . com had parts in 0 days thanks for nothing
negative	ordered a left and right hand lower_control_arm for a dodge caliber .
negative	first time using partsgeek . com .
negative	received two left_hand parts a week_later .
negative	( no shipping options available ) my invoiced stated one right and one left .
negative	customer service is a joke .
negative	they would respond with 0 sentence answers which did not answer my questions .
negative	they eventually send me the " correct " link for the right hand part .
negative	wait another week for the part .
negative	invoice states right hand side .
negative	open it to find another left .
negative	complain again ....
negative	they reply with " we '_ll look into this ."
negative	so i want send back two of the three lefts ....
negative	i have to get an authorization_number from them before i can .
negative	wait several days before they reply to my email .
negative	get the number .
negative	ask them if they '_ll reimburse me for return shipping since it was their fault .
negative	they said no .
negative	so i can '_t even get a full_refund for their screw ups .
negative	i ended_up having to order from another company .
negative	couldn_'_t be without a vehicle for another week .
negative	oh and the best part .....
negative	i paid three different prices for the exact_same part !!!!
negative	!
negative	painful waste of time and no customer service .
negative	can not talk to a human and they love to sell you parts that are not what you need .
negative	either the staff consists of untrained retired elevator operators or just the metally challenged .
negative	avoid doing_business with this company at all costs unless you like to waste endless hours of time and money with this underperforming under delivering company .
negative	i had a straightforward order .
negative	a rear windshield_wiper_arm and blade and they could not manage to successfully send me the correct parts .
negative	one of the products i ordered is made up of very cheap parts and has already broken .
negative	i assume the rest of the products are just as cheap , however some have not been installed yet .
negative	one product that i returned took lots of follow_up emails on my part , customer service rep must have lost track of my return because i had to tell her multiple_times what the order number was .
negative	it took a very long time to actually get my money back .
negative	the 00 return_policy is not enough time .
negative	i would never recommend this product or company .
negative	you advertise online that the part number : 0000 -_00000000 fits 0000_bmw_000i .
negative	however the part was not even the same shape as the original part .
negative	you say that this is not a good reason to cover the return cost !!!
negative	!
negative	anyways , i sent your pathetic part back and it cost me $_00 . 00 .
negative	tracking_# 00000000000000000000
negative	hopefully you will send me a credit for this amount if you are a respectful business .
negative	your reaction made me believe that you are running a scam business .
negative	having ordered these goods on 00th_december and was told they would be sent out first_class_post , they have not been received as yet so very disappointed in the service .
negative	i ordered a heater_fan blower_motor for an audi .
negative	the brand_name appeared to be german and the box had sentences written in german .
negative	i opened the box and found the motor had a " made in china " sticker .
negative	i notified parts_geek and told them the motor was new and never installed .
negative	i paid over $_00 to send the sub - standard part back to them .
negative	when i got my refund , i found that parts_geek had charged me $_00 for a restock_fee of the $_000 part .
negative	this is poor customer service .
negative	i will never use parts_geek again .
negative	i have a large group of friends that have been advised of my distaste for the company ( bad tactical move parts_geek ).
negative	i found a real bosch fan at ecs tuning for $_000 .
negative	my overall cost is about $_000 thanks to the fleecing from parts_geek .
negative	was told 00 hour dispatch , didn_'_t leave them until 0 days_later , was told i was sent a email about the delay .
negative	i never recived the email .
negative	after booking on your site we were pleased with the low price .
negative	after receiving our receipt we noticed the price had raised 00 dollars .
negative	after returning home we noticed a charge on our credit_card of an international fee of $_000 . 00 .
negative	after calling the motel where we booked we found that expedia had booked our room through them and not you people .
negative	we feel_like we are being jerked around .
negative	what is up ?
negative	they said it was a . exact_fit for my truck ..... not even close ! there is absolutely no way to speak with them either . not only does part not fit i have to pay to ship back and 00_% restocking . will never use them again ! you will never speak to a human . very poor customer service .
negative	check out reviews . they have been reported to the bbb a bunch .
negative	started with no customer service to answer phone . at_least 0hr on hold cumulativly ..
negative	finally gave up and ordered parts from vague descriptions on site ( no dimensions or other specifics ) parts came in wrong not what was described on site still_waiting for one to come in so i can return todayis the 0th ordered on the 00th .
negative	trying to get return_authorization no response .
negative	00 return_policy ridiculous when it takes 0_weeks to get the parts and schedule the job .
negative	now i have to pay shipping for wrong parts i guess .
negative	i ordered a set of headlights for my 0000_pontiac_grand_prix .
negative	partsgees shipped me one headlight and a tailight from an_unknown vehicle .
negative	i opened a support_ticket within three_days of receiving the part .
negative	i received the auto - generated response saying i would be contacted by customer service .
negative	eventually i was contacted , and asked to provide some information , which i did .
negative	this went on for about three_weeks as it seemed that everytime i sent an e_-_mail , it was read by a different individual who was not familiar with my issue , and the whole_process started over again .
negative	i also sent two telephone_number where i could be reached , along with the best time to reach me , and did not receive a call .
negative	i received an e_-_mail saying that someone attempted to call , but they did not leave a message or a return number , so i have no_idea .
negative	i sent pictures of the item , and a copy of my invoice twice , explaining what happened , including the wrong part received , and the part that i was supposed to receive .
negative	i even included the part numbers , all to no_avail .
negative	i had to open multiple support tickets just to get a status on the previous ticket .
negative	finally , i was sent a return_authorization email , but the part number identified on the authorization was for the part that i had actually ordered and wanted to keep , ( the headlight ), and not for the part that i did not order and wanted to return ( the unkown tailight ).
negative	i knew if i had sent the tailight and the part number did not match the part number on the return_authorization , it would make the issue even more confusing and i would not receive my refund .
negative	i sent another e_-_mail explain the return_authorization contained the wrong part number .
negative	now it is mor than 00 days since my order and i can not even get a reply to any emails .
negative	i am stuck with one headlight when i paid for two , and also a tailight which i have no use for .
negative	if you want to know whether or not i think partsgeek '_s customer service is rude , and the way i am being treated is unreasonable , the answer is yes .
negative	i would never think of ordering from pg again for fear of being treated the same way , nor would i recommend pg to any of my friends or family .
negative	order # 00 -_00000000
negative	it '_s fine and good to have a forum to air our grievances , but i think these reviews , good and bad , should be visible to potential_customers before their purchase .
negative	in the past 00_hours , there have been at_least 00 negative_reviews ( red and orange stars ), i counted them .
negative	this information would have been beneficial to me had it been available when i went to the pg website .
negative	the few reviews pg shows on its site are , of course , all good , and are more than a year_old .
negative	on the pg website , i did not see a link to this page , where one has the option to read the reviews before purchasing .
negative	also , there is no information on follow - up on how pg resolves the negative_reviews .
negative	i know the company has a 00 - day return_policy , and if my experience is any indication of pg '_s business_practices , if your issue is not resolved within that 00 - day window , consider yourself blessed to even get an_email response beyond day 00 .
negative	if your experience is similar to mine , and you are either stuck with parts you can '_t use , still_waiting for parts beyond the expected delivery date , or expecting a refund , after you leave your individual review , post a simple comment to this thread saying you agree .
negative	maybe we can get some visibility .
negative	i was sent the wrong part and realized it when they sent me the confirmation so i immediately called to cancel before it was even sent .
negative	it was impossible to get through on their phone system so after holding many_times for 00_minutes or longer the voice comes back and says go to the web_site and log in and someone will call you back in 00hrs .
negative	well 00_hrs went by and no call in fact 00 days went by with no calls .
negative	they did send me a reference_number and the problem was i could not send the product back since they shipped it anyway without a rma_# or they would not refund my money .
negative	since i could not get anyone to call me back or issue me a rma_# i sent it back anyway since i was worried_about the 00 day window to return it and i am hoping they will still give me a refund .
negative	i literally was on there phone for many hours and many days at_least 00 times with no response .
negative	so if you are buying something from them , you better get a rma_# in advance just in case you need to return your product .
negative	parts_geek need more people to handle all their customer service issues if they want to stay in business and have a great rating .
negative	i will no_longer be buying anything from them ever again .
negative	won_'_t do_business with this company they over charged me by $_00 and iit took 0_weeks for item to arrive
negative	i booked a flight through you not knowing that the seats were all gone the airline charged me more to get a seat .
negative	the airline said that you are always doing this , sorry to see you are not being honest
negative	check the small_print .
negative	my protein say they are not liable for products not delivered to you , once the parcel has left their depot .
negative	i tracked my last parcel , and it said it was delivered and signed for at a certain time of day , when in fact i was at work !
negative	no parcel and a forged signature !
negative	then try getting them to do something about it , still_waiting for a response !!!!.
negative	00 / 00 / 0000 . update .
negative	having got a phone_call 0 hours after writing this review , my protein phoned me and promissed to sort it out and phoneback , or email the following_day . that was last_week i '_m still_waiting . no contact . no goods , but they have my money !!
negative	!
negative	i ordered a part , and then was informed that it was their policy not to ship to an_alternate shipping address .
negative	i '_m on the road , and needed the part where i was .
negative	when i brought this to their attention , i was told , ok , we '_ll gladly cancel your order .
negative	not even a " sorry for the inconvenience ".
negative	i know companies have policies , but i '_ve never seen a company so uncaring about how its customers feel .
negative	i guess in this age you can get away with that .
negative	thanks anyway .
negative	our good arrived in customs on the friday .
negative	we received notification , and emailed them a query .
negative	no answer
negative	we sent it again on monday .
negative	no answer .
negative	we tried_calling .
negative	no reply .
negative	tuesday , we tried faxing them .
negative	no response .
negative	emailed them .
negative	no reply .
negative	tried_calling them .
negative	no reply .
negative	wednesday emailed them 00 times , and sent them the same fax 0 times !
negative	a reponse !!
negative	a response that didn_'_t actually answer our query in any way whatsoever .
negative	i cannot recommend highly_enough that you avoid this terrible , terrible company if yo value your goods or your time .
negative	placed order card was charged few_days lateri got an_email_stating i would be getting a cre0000000000000000000000dit ... no_explanation .
negative	i tried_calling several_times no one ever answered sat on hold 00_mins one day !!
negative	so need less to say i never got my part
negative	for the labor day i '_ve received an e_-_mail that if you spend $_000 or more you are the beneficiary of 00_%_discount and free shipping .
negative	i ordered 0 tires michelin 000 / 00 r00 and this was not the case .
negative	not only that was no discount but there are shipping_charges and other extra_charges .
negative	i contact the sales_representative and they told me that tire_rack doesn_'_t have discounts .
negative	i was dealing_with the tire_rack ?
negative	for that i could have contact them directly .
negative	even_though i spent a ton of money with parts_geek i '_ve learned my lesson and the worst of everything was how i was treated by the employes and the supervisor of this company on the phone !
negative	finally i '_ve got the tires without_any headaches from somewhere_else !
negative	after being_bombarded by emails i finally broke and ordered from musclefood .
negative	well only half my order arrived .
negative	pastrami was 000gr underweight and 0 x tubs of nuts were missing .
negative	two_weeks_later they refunded me for the nuts with a grovelling apology , but i still think it '_s a joke selling me something that '_s not in stock .
negative	as for the pastrami , again i complained and got a refund .
negative	but one star is all i can give this company as this was the first time i have ordered from them and too many things went wrong .
negative	don_'_t think i will be using them again .
negative	finally , on the forum muscletalk there are two worrying discussions on this company '_s chicken and its freshness .
negative	chicken that '_s not fresh is dangerous even life threatening .
negative	again this has scared me away from future_purchases .
negative	there are other_companies i have used many_times before without_any of these dramas .
negative	selling out of date egg_whites .
negative	impossible to get my money back .
negative	avoid like the plague .
negative	specifically used this to get cash back from greenflag but got nothing .
negative	just goes through lists of questions everytime you try to find out why it has not come through .
negative	i do most shopping online too
negative	when i removed the silver protective strip , ink leaked out , onto our new carpet .
negative	it took a lot of cleaning to get the ink out of our carpet .
negative	also , once i installed the new color_cartridge , my printer will not print in black and white mode , only in color mode .
negative	in the 0 years using kodak ink , i never had a problem .
negative	now i am not sure what to do , since it will print only in color .
negative	a waste of my money .
negative	i ordered a part and tracking said it shipped 0 / 00 / 0000 .
negative	i tracked it a couple of more times and it showed movement .
negative	the package arrive in malvern , ar by ups on 0 / 00 / 0000 it was destroyed and thrown_away .
negative	i found that it was damged on my own on 0 / 00 / 0000 .
negative	not from parts_geek .
negative	my wife contacted parts_geek by email .
negative	( you can '_t talk to a person .)
negative	they were trying to send a pickup call_tag for the damage i have not received .
negative	we finally got parts_geek to understand the problem .
negative	they credited my account and sent an_email_saying if i wated to re - order the part , shipping would be free .
negative	i replied yes to re - order the part .
negative	i recieved another email to call customer service and was given an extension number .
negative	after trying to call five different times i have yet been able to talk to anyone .
negative	i sent them another email to call me because they won_'_t answer !
negative	they sent me an_email_saying your reply to support requst has_been noted someone will contact you in 00 to 00_hours during normal business hours !
negative	heck i give up !
negative	first and last time to try this again !
negative	i ordered a passenger_side hood hinge and they sent me a drivers_side hood hinge .
negative	they made me pay return shipping fees when they were the ones who made the mistake .
negative	i order lots of parts for my vehicles from all_kinds of different companies and never , not even once have i had to pay for the return shipping fees when a company ships me the wrong part in they ' re error except for this truly unprofessional company .
negative	i will never use them again and i hope you heed my warning and don_'_t buy from them .
negative	i bought headers for a 0000_subaru out back .
negative	when i received the part it didn_'_t fit so i requested a return_authorization_number .
negative	i received an_email back that basically told me they had no_idea what i was talking_about .
negative	now i have to pay to return a part that i already paid to ship .
negative	i am not one to write_reviews but my experience has_been so incredibly terrible with fedex that i feel i should share so that people can avoid this terrible experience in the future .
negative	my product first of all they would not deliver to a home address so i had to go through my cousins business .
negative	that wasn_'_t too big of a deal .
negative	then the package delivered very damaged , and the claims process has_been a nightmare .
negative	terrible customer service .
negative	terrible communication .
negative	i am the one doing all the work when they are the ones who messed_up .
negative	i had to call them to find all this out because no one was going to call me to let_me know they messed_up and now the agent working on my case is always off when i try to contact them .
negative	then they messed_up with my claim and now i have to do everything again because they messed_up again and no one is nice about it .
negative	i work in customer service so i know what good customer service is and this has_been the complete opposite .
negative	i will do everything in my power to never use fedex again , they just_plain suck !
negative	enjoyed tge exoerince with you ..
negative	thanks alot !!
negative	!
negative	i ordered an expensive figure through nippon yasan .
negative	it was shipped fairly quickly , but when it arrived , one of the accessories was broken .
negative	i directly contacted the manufacturer - alter - about the issue , but they didn_'_t have a replacement they could send me .
negative	i then turned to nippon yasan to see if they would assist me with a replacement .
negative	they told me it '_s not their policy to replace , return , or exchange defective merchandise , and i was out of luck .
negative	keep this in mind before shopping with them .
negative	they did nothing to remedy the issue and did not seem to care , as they already had my money .
negative	it '_s a shame that they would sooner choose to pass defective merchandise on to their customers rather_than strive for customer_satisfaction .
negative	i will never shop with nippon yasan again .
negative	polite , but useless customer service .
negative	after making reservation online and going there and choose my space i was informed that i needed to pay over my quoted price of $ 0 - that i needed to pay $_00 for insurance .
negative	i has seen moved to another location where i do not need to pay it .
negative	i ordered a helmet .
negative	they took 00 days to ship my order and never communicated with me until i called them on the 00th day .
negative	they shipped only after i filed a paypal claim .
negative	if it was back ordered they should have just let_me know .
negative	i received it about 00 days after i ordered and paid for it .
negative	where did it come from australia ?
negative	if you want to know how they really are , just ask someone that have bought simcity 0000 to them .
negative	they were selling bunches of keys of the game on " pre_- order " months before the release_date , promising they would get the key 0 days before the release .
negative	the keys were hungarian ( not multi_- language ) and " unexpectedly " the majority of people didn_'_t want to play in hungarian .
negative	what they basically did on the release_date is to ignore all the pre_- orders and continue selling more_expensive multi_- language keys to new customers ( who were going to pay more for it ) while lying the pre_- order customers with empty_promises and broken deadlines ( around 00 broken deadlines ) about when were they going to get what they paid for months_ago .
negative	today is the release day , i '_m a pre_- order customer , it '_s 00 : 00 and i don_'_t have the key i bought to them long ago and should have arrived 0 days ago .
negative	there are quite a lot of people like me and no explanations .
negative	well , some of the ones that have got theirs say their keys were already used ( and now have kind of a second problem ).
negative	i just recommend you to run away from their services as far as you can .
negative	i ordered two parts that were same and was only delivered one yet they claim they sent both .
negative	i filled_out the support_ticket online which is the only way to contact them because they do not have a customer service phone_number .
negative	i got an initial response that did not make_sense i could not tell if they were asking me a question or trying to tell me the reason_why my second part was delivered .
negative	i responded to the email explaining exactly the problem and even telling them the probable mix_up on their end as to why my second part was not sent and never got a response and had to dispute the charge on my credit_card because i paid for two parts but only got one .
negative	ordered a range hood .
negative	received it .
negative	when we went to install it we found the stainless_steel was stained .
negative	attempted to clean it with stainless cleaner .
negative	but it did not remove the stain .
negative	you could still see it clearly since it would have been at eye level .
negative	chatted with matt on the mainfaucet site .
negative	sent two images .
negative	he told me he would have another unit on the way that day .
negative	over a week_later i received a can of stainless_steel cleaner in the mail .
negative	no mention of whether or not a new unit was being shipped and no notification of any kind .
negative	chatted with simon and was told i would have to send images .
negative	i told_him that i had .
negative	then i was told he would have to wait for the factory to reply .
negative	when asked what happened to whatever matt had put in motion i got no response .
negative	after dealing_with that i opted to return the unit and was told on nov 00 that a check minus shipping_charges would be issued within a couple of days .
negative	it is now december 00 and i have not received a check and we were told that one had not been sent out yet .
negative	this is truly the worst service i have experienced in a long long time .
negative	when i placed my order for a window_motor and track assembly for my pontiac_grand_prix gt 0000 model year , i had a surprise when my delivery arrived .
negative	instead of the drivers door unit , you sent me the drivers rear unit ?
negative	you sent me a broken part and you want me to pay to ship it back to you .
negative	thanks for the good service .
negative	they suck because when the part dose not work you have to email them and it takes them 00 to 00_hours for them to get back to you and they do not have a phone_number where you can talk to someone so you can tell them and speed up the fix be it replacing the part or a refund .
negative	because the part i got did not work and i am stuck with a part i can do nothing with an tell they send me a shipping sticker so i can send it back for a refund
negative	ordered 0 tyres online , no_problems reported .
negative	a couple of days_later i get a call to say the tyres are out of stock and my credit_card will have to be refunded the payment .
negative	why take my money if there is no stock ?
negative	why allow ordering of out of stock items on your website ?
negative	why should i bother using blackcircles again ?
negative	the item was ordered on second of june as a birthday_gift for my son , delivery was programmed as standard , that is , within 0 days .
negative	on the 0rd of june i received a " garbled " automated telephone_call stating that delivery was to take place within 00_hours .
negative	by friday , the 0th of june , no delivery had been made .
negative	my son worked from home on a couple of days expecting the delivery .
negative	on friday 0th of june i telephoned homebase " on line query departrment " to be told that the item had been delivered on 0th of june and left in a " secure place " on the front of the house .
negative	this had not taken place and there is no secure place at the front of the house as it is completely open to the road !!!!
negative	additionally , no unsuccessful delivery notification card had been left at the house , the item could not have been left at the back of the house as a locked gate secures access to the back of the house .
negative	the lady handling my query eventually arranged for an item to be available for collection at the southampton shop on saturday 0th_june .
negative	i requested refund of the delivery fee which was received in my bank_account on monday 0th_june .
negative	additionally i found the on line ordering web_page not very user_friendly ( like the amazon one ), for example i could not alter the name of the delivery address name to my son '_s , the name had to be mine .
negative	quite honestly i do not think that delivery of the item took place so that " collection " was the delivery method homebase wanted to take place .
negative	i am a very dissatisfied customer .
negative	unverständlich , wie man dem kunden eine lieferung ohne versandkosten vorgaukelt aber dann 0 % für_die zahlung per kreditkarte für auslandseinsatz aufbrummt ?
negative	!
negative	they shrink_wrap used games and sell them as new .
negative	don_'_t waste your time .
negative	i would never , ever shop at this place again .
negative	the customer service people are arrogant and rude .
negative	all they want is the money .
negative	beware of this retailer !!
negative	i bought a laptop here and questioned the sale price later , and they told me ... too bad , you already bought it at the high price , so why would we give you the sale price .
negative	i would sooner go to another store .
negative	never again !!!
negative	!
negative	took them almost 0_weeks to just to send an in stock battery out and refuse to be fair on returning it .
negative	00 days to get it to my house !
negative	doctor '_s rx on file but they would not ship order because i didn_'_t sign_up for automatic shipments .
negative	this means a new rx for every time you order .
negative	will never order from them again .
negative	amazing how they automatically came up with my name , address and credit_card - but no record of a previous prescription .
negative	you need to improve your customer service .
negative	i attempted to contact your company because i had a damaged part .
negative	all i received was an_automated phone recording and put on hold .
negative	no one ever answered the phone .
negative	i don_'_t think i will ever purchase from your company again .
negative	first time customer not impressed
negative	hotel a horror .

negative	when i took my concerns to the manager , about the insulation falling from the ceiling on my expensive and collectible car ( 0 of 00 and in mint_condition ) she said : “ it ’_s only paper insulation and it wipes right off ”.
negative	to which i quickly replied and before she placed her hand on the surface : " don ’ t do that ” which she promptly did .
negative	the she said : “ look it wipes right off ”.
negative	i immediately asked her to leave before i told her what an_idiot that she is .
negative	i had to clean , buff and polish the hood several_times to get the marks out .
negative	it ’_s not surprising that she drives a geo ( nothing against geo ’_s but it ’_s not my idea of a sensible or desirable car ).
negative	when i moved out of the unit she asked me : ” if i had cleaned the unit out prior to leaving ” to which i replied : “ i have removed my belonging but left all of the debris from the ceiling behind ” and promptly left without saying another word .
negative	i can not write this as if i am speaking to a friend , because you are not .
negative	i ordered parts and received in a timely_manner , but i ordered the wrong parts .
negative	this is where the problem started after 0 days i requested again stating that i had sent a request 0 daty earlier .
negative	i got a new e_-_mail_stating that i would get an_rma which i did , but it was only for the bearing # 000flstating that if i returned anything but what was on the rma there would be no refund for parts not on the list .
negative	i only want to get my money back but if i don_'_t that '_s ok .
negative	i have never dealt_with anyone that is less user_friendly and i buy quite a few items on line .
negative	i will never deal with you folks again and will not recommend you to friends or business_associates .
negative	thank_you ,

negative	i '_ve used rentalcars in the uk and they have been magical and last_year in malaga again , they were excellent .
negative	sadly not so this year when they booked me a car with goldcar at malaga airport .
negative	first off the queue took an_hour and five_minutes to reach the counter .
negative	once at the desk i explained i had my own insurance for the excess and anyway rentalcars had covered all the collision insurance .
negative	yes , but it does not cover the underside of the car , the clutch or tyres .
negative	now i '_m used to the tyres and keys not being covered but how do i check the clutch and underside of a car in an underground car_park .
negative	you '_ll be better off paying us € 00 or we '_ll take €_000 off you credit_card even if the amount does not come to that ......... charming .
negative	i '_ll stick with my own insurance and here is my card .
negative	so the free collision insurance is pretty well worthless .
negative	now i understood that the tank was full to empty and that fuel would be slightly_higher_than normal pump prices .
negative	we want €_000 for the fuel to fill a peugeot_000 ; what when its only got a 00 litre tank , so i hand over my card again .
negative	this is a 00_% increase over the average cost in spain .
negative	gets better as i ' d only done 00km and the needle is coming off full , so being of a sad disposition i contacted peugeot and they too were surprised .
negative	they commented that " normally " you have to travel a fair distance in any of their vehicles , for a one with a " full " tank to start to drop on the fuel_gauge .
negative	the car was clean and tidy but never use goldcar , if this is what rentalcars comes up with .
negative	the parts i received were not the ones i ordered .
negative	i ordered two tie_rods , and not only was i sent two different_sizes ( both incorrect ) they were also missing the seals .
negative	when attempting to return the incorrect parts , i have not been able to get anyone from partsgeek on the phone .
negative	i follow the steps outlined on their website for returns , and generate a " return ticket " and after doing that three_times , i still have only received emails saying " thank_you for return .
negative	someone will be contacting you within 00_hrs ."
negative	yet no one has contacted me .
negative	it was bad enough that i received the wrong parts , but its even worse buying from a company that doesn_'_t stand_behind what they sell .
negative	i would like to have the opportunity to return this item , just didn_'_t work my vehicle still reflects the same problem , although i changed the part and used a technician to do it , please contact regarding the returning process .
negative	terrible customer service .
negative	this is like dealing_with ebay , not a proper online company .
negative	i received my part in a box with loose tape falling_off and barely closed .
negative	worst packing i have ever_seen !
negative	i bought what i thought was a deal on some marc jacobs perfume .
negative	the item came without a box , seal broken , and leaked all over the packaging .
negative	i wrote them an_email ( the only way other than a fax that you can contact them ) a week_ago and they have not replied .
negative	poor service , lousy product , and a feeling of being taken .
negative	i will never order from this company again .
negative	and i `_m $_000 . 00 poorer for the experience .
negative	i had ink leak out over the place .
negative	i wiil never place a order with inkfarm again .
negative	still cleaning up ink
negative	i ordered a few items from this company for my mother for mothers_day .
negative	i ordered them a week and a half in advance .
negative	a week_later when i had not received them , i contacted the company .
negative	after being on hold for over 0 min then cut_off , i called back .
negative	i was told that the order had been placed and sent to the shipping department .
negative	it had not been shipped yet , but was being_processed !?
negative	i used this company because they are in georgia and i like supporting the local_businesses .
negative	i will not make that mistake again .
negative	if you want your order within two_weeks please use someone_else .
negative	i will stick with amazon .

negative	significant delay in receiving medication for my dog .
negative	by_far the best prices i have seen , they will even beat out anyone_else with a good deal .
negative	but afetr purchasing several_times from the site i have repeatedly received the wrong order , paying for a 00 serving container and getting a 00 when it arrived , then after_contacting them , they told me to send it back and they would issue me what i paid for .... yet again sent the wrong_size for what i paid .
negative	then get put on hold for over an_hour trying to reach customer service , then told that due to their customer service office being closed i have to call back during their hours of operation .
negative	ordered a part got double charged for it .
negative	i tried to email them numerous_times and i got the same reply every time .
negative	that it was not a double charge it was credit enquiry .
negative	yet it was taken out of my bank twice .
negative	tried to call the number they gave_me and was put on all dreidel when i '_m back here for more than 00 minute tried that all day for 0 days straight .
negative	and still got no where .
negative	i ended_up disputed it with my bank so they can take_care of it .
negative	good afternoon .
negative	about the order 000000000 of 0 / 00 / 00 , did not get the products .
negative	please check in your system if there was any return of the brazilian postal service ( correios ) to the iherb inc .
negative	what should i do in this case ?
negative	i look_forward to returning soon .
negative	000 days have passed
negative	on three seperate occasions i ordered several products which , according to the website , should be in stock .
negative	my first order to more then 00 days to be completed .
negative	with my last order the website claimed a delivery time of 0 - 0 days .
negative	after 0_weeks you ask for the status of your order .
negative	the tell you their supplier is sending the goods .
negative	so please wait 0 more days .
negative	0_weeks_later you inform again .
negative	now the supplier has stock issues and they are not sure when to deliver .
negative	never again will i order something at golfstore europe .
negative	i ' d rather pay extra at the competitors and receive human like support and treatment .
negative	i '_ve been waiting for over a week for a full answer on how to get the deluxe content for far_cry 0 .
negative	instead i get pointless answers and links that provide no useful info with broken image for screenshots .
negative	at the end of each reply from your support i get a sentence like " i see you no_longer need our assistance ..." what makes you think so if you '_ve never asked if i need further assistance ?
negative	even ea support is better_than what you provide and that should show you how badly you provide support .
negative	at the end you ask me to write a nice review ... well after over a week .. here i am writing a review .
negative	keep out !
negative	i haven_'_t received a conformation_email_letting_me know my products have shipped .
negative	its been a week since i placed my order ..
negative	i still_haven_'_t received my order ..
negative	00 days since my order and waiting , charge my card the same day , then credited back , then charged next_day again , that was on nov . 00 today dec 0st and i still did not got my order , i will never buy anything from this site .
negative	beware that if you buy the wrong ink_cartridge , you only have 00 days to return it .
negative	the point being : if like me you order in advance of your inks running out , or when printer_basics has a special_offer on .
negative	make_sure you order the right ink_cartridge ......
negative	their prices are very good , unquestionably some of the cheapest around , however , once the order is accepted it all rather falls apart .
negative	they send u an_email with an overly optimistic estimate of delivery date ( carefully and discreetly adding " subject to availability ").
negative	you then get an_email link to trust_pilot requesting you rate them before you have experienced the joys of their off - shore ( i '_m guessing ) customer_services .
negative	while evidently well - meaning and for the most part polite and patient are , as far as i can tell simply reading off what it says on the orders part of their website .
negative	they appear to have no additional info , thus rendering a call to them when u are often passed to voicemail after hanging on for ages utterly pointless .
negative	i '_m still_waiting and hoping for delivery - i guess you can forgive them the imperfect aftersales ( assuming it does eventually arrive ) for the amazing prices ..
negative	ok after all that , ( several days_later ) have just called them to be informed that the item is out of stock .
negative	so for the 0 other calls i '_ve made where i have been informed everything is progressing fine and the item is in stock , all of sudden it appears to have been untrue .
negative	to their ( slightly_dubious ) credit they immediately offered a refund and send a confirmation_email of the cancellation .
negative	i read all the negative_reviews but decided to persevere anyway as the prices were good and some appeared happy .
negative	i wish i had paid more attention to the negative ones now .
negative	total waste of time !
negative	useless customer_services , who are not remotely rude but patently very poorly informed ...
negative	further to this once more - they have made no attempt to refund the money - claiming back thru credit_card company .. do not use extak !
negative	!
negative	and finally .. refund came thru after nearly 0_weeks from the original transaction .
negative	only use extak if you want to waste a sizeable chunk of your life waiting for an item that will likely never appear .
negative	talking to customer_services , who though i think , well - intentioned seem to have no sway whatsoever over the situation and can merely read to you what you already know while costing u premium_rate for the call , and finally waiting weeks for your money back ..
negative	the town that i traveled to had few available hotel_rooms the weekend i was there .
negative	one full hotel gave_me the number to reservationcounter . com and a list of a few hotels that possibly had a room .
negative	when i called reservationcounter . com they found an available room but i was hesitant to make a reservation because i knew nothing about the hotel .
negative	the person i was talking to hurried me to make the reservation before the room was gone .
negative	i did reluctantly make the reservation rather_than sleep in my car that evening .
negative	when i got to the hotel , the room i reserved was not available and i had to take a room that i normally would not accept ( a smoking_room ).
negative	the hotel did give me a cheaper rate ( due to having to take the smoking_room ) than reservationcounter . com .
negative	the hotel told me to call reservationcounter . com and cancel the original reservation .
negative	i called and tried to cancel the original reservation and the first representative hung_up on me ( to be fair , maybe it was a mistake ).
negative	the second representative did cancel the reservation but still , 0 days_later , the charge has not been reversed .
negative	to make it worse the days inn hotel that reservationcounter . com sent me to was one of the nastiest hotels that i ' d ever_seen .
negative	from this experience , reservationcounter . com seems like a company out for a quick sale with no concern for the customer .
negative	i made one shake with that product drank it and couldn_'_t hold it down threw it up three_times horrible product and for the price it makes it that much worse .
negative	we requested the second smallest car for a trip in italy .
negative	we picked_up the car in sorrento , it was the next size up from what we requested ( it was a lancia musa with more than 00 , 000_km and quite worn tires , scratched up and top - heavy , a truly horrible car ).
negative	it got us where we needed to be and i enjoyed our tour of italy in spite of it .
negative	trust me , in italy , you want to be driving the smallest car possible , especially if your plans include seeing naples , the amalfi_coast , and sicily .
negative	problem is , when we turned the car in palermo we were charged about 000_euros extra because the car we received was bigger than the one we requested .
negative	this is called bait - and - switch and it is an unscrupulous business tactic .
negative	i couldn_'_t argue with the guy about it since my italian is minimal and the agent couldn_'_t speak_english or french , so i just ate the extra bill .
negative	it won_'_t kill me .
negative	still , if a company is unable to provide the smaller car we requested -- and would have preferred -- they should still honor the price .
negative	cars provided should be in better repair .
negative	my next car_rental in europe will use a different agency .
negative	it is also worth_noting that nobody was at the place in sorrento where we were supposed to pick_up the car until about a half - hour after we were scheduled .
negative	that kind of freaked me out too , since our entire travel agenda was predicated on having this car , but the guy did eventually show up and was actually quite friendly and funny .
negative	why do i receive an e_-_mail the day after i receive my order saying " we '_ve missed you " come_back and enjoy 00_%_off * you order plus free fast shipping !"
negative	with an 00 / 00 / 00 expiration_date .
negative	i just ordered a four ( 0 ) month supply .
negative	i have been a loyal_customer for a long time now and can never receive a discount with an expiration_date that i can use .
negative	called to file claim on a computer and set time to call after 0 pm .
negative	guy kept calling in the morning when we were not available .
negative	had to call back probably 0 - 0 times .
negative	finally had to talk to a manager to get anywhere and even that took two times to finally get them to call at the correct time to get the computer fixed .
negative	from start to finish was 0 month , even when there policy states it is repaired within 0 business days or you get your money back .
negative	in my opinion it was a very unacceptable experience .
negative	if the repairman kept closing the ticket you should have called or emailed to find out what the problem was .
negative	fortunately the computer is fixed now , unfortunately i still have a warranty on this computer and another one with you .
negative	hope and pray i never have to use it again !
negative	my october_0000 order for a mitsubishi mini_split arrived well_packaged but was missing the stand on which to mount the condenser unit .
negative	i phoned the toll_free number to report this but still have not received a call back or email concerning this issue .
negative	this charge will be disputed with my credit_card company and the condenser stand reordered from another supplier if it is not sent immediately .
negative	its holding up the install process .
negative	i can '_t recommend this firm at this time .
negative	i purchased a battery and screen for my evo but both products did not work .
negative	the top of the screen does not respond and the battery was completly dead with . 0mil volts that would not charge .
negative	they will not take back the screen once its used but how do you know it works until you replace it .
negative	ordered a part for my truck , parts don_'_t work not even close to where it is supposed to be .
negative	according to site it was the right number , well it was not !!!
negative	i tried to contact customer service over 00 times could not get through now have my credit_card co handling this matter .
negative	don_'_t use this agency because of predatory policies regarding refunds .
negative	try to book directly with european rental_agency .
negative	on calling to ask for refund auto_europe agent rudely hung_up .
negative	the floormats i ordered do not fit even a little_bit !!!
negative	they were listed as fitting a 0000_infiniti g00 coupe .
negative	when we tried to put them in the car they would not fit without hitting the rails where the seat slides back and forth .
negative	thus we were not able to adjust the seat to the proper location we need to drive car .
negative	we would have to have the seat all the way in the back position .
negative	that would make it impossible to to push the clutch_pedal all the way in to get the car in gear .
negative	we read the return directions sent with the floormats and would have to pay for return shipping and restocking_fee !!!!!!!!!!!
negative	as the mats seem to be fairly heavy it does not make sence to pay for return shipping and restocking_fee as this was not our fault that the do not fit the model car they were purchased for so i guess we will just have to eat the $_00 . 00 we paid for them !!!!!!!
negative	we will not be doing bussiness with parts_geek again !
negative	other buyers_beware !!!!!!!!!!!!
negative	lenny :{
negative	they advertise buyer_protection , but they do not provide it .
negative	ultimately they are the judge and jury , so be forewarned that buyer_protection does not exist , i found out the hard way .
negative	when you get to your car_hire place , there will be extra_charges .
negative	everything should be specified on the website .
negative	i used rentalcars . com previously , they were much_better .
negative	no_hidden_charges , paid up front , arrived , picked keys up and left ( brand_new motor ).
negative	vipcars gave_me a quote , i booked it , but when i arrived to pick_up car , the extra_charges meant the car was double the quote .
negative	not a great car either .
negative	call number that was presented on web_page only to realize that it was a fax_number , then when called customer service had to get a ticket number . i did not have to go through all this when they charged my credit_card .
negative	would like to speak to a live_person .
negative	i placed an order totaling 000 . 00 - you couldnt find the product and only credited me 000 . 00 - i will not do_business with a company like yours - dont contact me again
negative	and your site has not guided to purchase insurance that is useful ....
negative	not happy , item not delivered on 00 - 00 - 0000 as stated .
negative	my son will not get his christmas preasent till after christmas .
negative	this is one time of the year your company should be on time .
negative	and the web_site could have parts out of stock and u wont know until they charge u for them and then they say something was wrong with your shipping .
negative	which is not true . then they take_forever to return ur money .
negative	do not use partsgeek part number online do not match parts .
negative	they ship wrong part , part number on shipper is different from part number used online making it very difficult to resolve the problem !
negative	only to contact is e_-_mail with 00 - 00 hour turnaround .
negative	i finally gave up , ate the cost of the part and will never shop there again !!
negative	!
negative	ordered on line , called to check on parts the day they were to arrive only to find out they did not ship .
negative	they were waiting for me to call and confirm the order .
negative	why would i bother to order on line if you have to call to finish the order .
negative	told them to cancel and i purchased locally .
negative	we ordered 0 items .
negative	the le corbusier chairs and sofas were supposed to be leather : these are pu leather , feeling and smelling like plastic , with that distinctive pattern of faux leather , totally regular and homogenous , which is never the case with leather .
negative	website advertised semi_- aniline leather .
negative	office_chair was supposed to be totally constructed in chrome steel and castors in steel and black gum / plastic .
negative	seating part is , but the base , feet and castors are painted white metal and castors are in grey cheap plastic !
negative	and again leather is pu leather .
negative	plus it '_s dirty , blackened with dust in places , stained with some red colours in others .
negative	eames chair and ottoman were supposed to be of a " tan " colour .
negative	in fact , it '_s a " mottled light brown " colour , which is very well identified and proposed by other copies sellers , and is definitely not " tan " as_advertised .
negative	last but not least , chromes have too many scratches , dots , marks , etc .
negative	a total disaster .
negative	when you buy on the internet , the only way to have normal consumer experience is in pictures and description .
negative	here , nothing matches pictures and description .
negative	first response of customer service was : we will check if our suppliers may not have committed a mistake in materiel choice .
negative	so suppliers would " change " leather to pu leather without previous notice ?
negative	really ?
negative	commandé et payé 0 pneus .
negative	00 heures après : " on n ' a pas reçu votre paiement ".
negative	le_lendemain , problème toujours pas réglé alors que_j ' ai_été débité .
negative	après avoir écouté pendant 00_minutes les explications vaseuses d ' un perroquet parlant à peine le français m ' indiquant que " nous avons contacté notre service comptabilité qui va traiter votre problème ", je fais annuler la première commande qui était payée via_paypal , et débitée de_mon compte , paiement qu ' ils prétendaient ne_pas avoir reçu !
negative	je dépose réclamation auprès de paypal .
negative	et_je repasse commande ( bien niaisement ) chez pneusonline .
negative	même topo : paypal débite mon compte , je reçois le mail de confirmation du débit paypal .
negative	au_bout de 0 heures , je rappelle pneusonline : le même perroquet me répète : " nous allons vérifier votre paiement bla - bla ".
negative	je les soupçonne fortement de jouer la montre sur_les paiements et_les remboursements des clients .
negative	j ' avais donc versé 000_euros en 0 jours à ces branquignols , débités de_mon compte , preuves à_l ' appui , et ils s ' obstinaient à répéter que_je_n ' avais rien payé !
negative	heureusement , paypal a cette fois immédiatement annulé mon second paiement et apparemment placé delti . com sous surveillance ( disent - ils ).
negative	j ' ai perdu 0 heures en palabres et en démarches .
negative	j ' ai un slogan pour eux :
negative	avec delti , sortie de route garantie .
negative	meine umbuchung wurde trotz mehrfachen anrufens nicht durchgeführt .
negative	letztlich habe_ich selbst im hotel angerufen .
negative	werde nie mehr mit hrs buchen .
negative	the part i received was not the part in the picture , what a waist of money !!!!!
negative	!
negative	promised i would not buy from them again after the shambles i experienced with support over a pressure_washer ( no tracking_info , developed fault within 0_weeks , long wait times on phone ).
negative	however i was credited £_00 . 00 * goodwill * and decided to buy a guitar " wizard ".
negative	have not used it yet but was disappointed with it initially ( photocopied instructions , items just appeard to be * thrown * into an a0 envelope .
negative	also postage charges are way too high !
negative	where is my part ?
negative	parts_geek web_page was not working_properly when i placed the last two orders ,
negative	the first order despaired , then . the next_day i reorder again .
negative	they had send both orders .
negative	now i have many duplicated parts that i have to return to you .
negative	please advice thanks carlos monge .
negative	000 0000000
negative	mongemomo @_gmail . com
negative	the fact that you can '_t speak to an actually customer service person makes it impossible to return a part .
negative	even through all the packing the part is still broken .
negative	i ordered a xmas gift for my wife from your website and it did not arrive , so i did not have a gift for my wife on xmas day .
negative	man_skal ikke forvente at elgiganten ringer tilbage , når_man_har lovet det !
negative	i dette tilfælde har man lavet en_fejl et eller_andet sted i systemet !
negative	og_få_et_svar_på e_-_mail , kan godt lade vente_på sig !
negative	indtil til videre savner jeg stadig et_svar , det_er kun 0 dage siden man opdagede fejlen !
negative	i was ready to order a fuel_tank and my total was $_000 .
negative	i clicked the [ purchase ] button and then i get a screen saying my total was $_000 .
negative	wtf ?
negative	if you call the phone_number after 00_minutes it says , " due to high call_volumes we cannot answer you call at this time .
negative	please fill_out the form on our webpage " ( or something similar to this ) and then it hangs_up on you .
negative	i submitted a complaint 0 times trying to get them to stop the purchase but it goes through anyway .
negative	i tried to explain that i only need 0 fuel tanks for my truck not 0 but it finally gets stopped and the money is credited back into my account .
negative	since the price was a good one i ordered 0 tank about a week after my funds were returned but they never processed it .
negative	i had to go to their site and track the purchase to find out it had been cancelled .
negative	no email , no_explanation , nothing .
negative	i go to autopartswarehouse . com and asked them if they would price match and they do !
negative	they have email , online_chat , and people that answer the phone and even call you when there is a problem with out of stock items , or anything .
negative	do not buy from partsgeek . com because if you have any_problems you will be waiting a long time to get it resolved .
negative	ordered a front_grill for a vw_golf and received one for a vw jeta .
negative	ordered a right hand side head_light_assembly and received a left_hand side light_assembly .
negative	partsgeek want me to pay for shipping the parts back !
negative	very time consumning trying to get this sorted_out .
negative	should of just gone down to napa .
negative	will not use these geeks again !
negative	me vendieron mentiras , ya_que en su página de internet me dieron un precio y pagué el_servicio , posteriormente llegué a recoger el auto a la compañía sixt y me querían cobrar más de 000 dlls de_la tarifa prometida , y por supuesto me negué a pagarlo y renté en avis que me dió un_servicio de_primera sin tener que haberle pagado a vipcars su comisión , por favor les pido me regresen el_dinero a mi tarjeta de crédito con_la cual pagué , espero sus comentarios y_el reembolso por supusto .
negative	gracias de antemano
negative	shiping charges are too hi makes me want to never buy bfrom you again
negative	products that are not available should be removed from the sight or listed as special order with the time frame of expected delivery .
negative	to bait and cancel appears to be a ploy to get customer information for identity fraud .
negative	i will be watching my account even closer brlecause of this transaction .
negative	it has now been 0 month since i ordered the glasses .
negative	they have still not arrived and apparently lost in the mail .
negative	frames_direct have no_idea when i will get them .
negative	total disaster .
negative	there order will be late they send one_sentence emails very poor service do not buy from them they will not fix they ' re mistakes
negative	we are not happy with paypal .
negative	we did over a million dollars a year with them , have a 00 year history and then they decided to demand with out choice that they are going to hold 00_% of all funds for 00 days .
negative	this means they hold $_00 , 000 . 00 of our money on a constant basis for 00 days .
negative	so , we no_longer use their service for money services .
negative	very disappointed with trying to book by telephone .
negative	had to book by computer and that worked .
negative	the telephone operators didn_'_t seem to know what they were doing .
negative	very disappointing .
negative	otherwise the visit at the hotel was wonderful !
negative	get with the times !!!
negative	!
negative	i ordered sunglasses .
negative	just my luck they were out of stock .
negative	instead of the refund i opted to wait but nothing doing .
negative	never_heard from smart glasses despite_repeated_emails asking how long it would take to get the glasses i ordered and paid for .
negative	recently ordered a separate pair of sunglasses and have been ordered to pay $_00 in customs feed because the pair that were sent came from hong_kong and the sender was trying to shirk customs fees .
negative	not impressed
negative	i placed an order for a heated passenger chrome side_view replacement mirrow for a 0000_ford_focus from parks_geek .
negative	received the product in a reasonable_amount of time .
negative	the problem that i had is that i did not receive the chrome part for the mirror .
negative	i received a " black " part for the mirror .
negative	i send an_email the day after receiving it and
negative	it has_been like trying to deal with congress and obama on obamacare .
negative	it '_s an
negative	absolute joke to communicate with your company .
negative	no one had the courtesy the give
negative	me a phone_call to simplify the error on your side .
negative	instead it has taken many days
negative	to find out through emails that i am now expected to return the entire product at my
negative	cost , etc .
negative	i '_m going to find a chrome part locally and you can forget of me ever doing_business with you .
negative	this has_been the worst online order i had ever_encountered .
negative	i was sent the incorrect part and returned as directed and received three quarters of my ourchased price money .
negative	the part i needed you never had in stock and may never stock .
negative	the part that i received should never have been sent out .
negative	i am very dissatisfied and do not plan on ordering anything_else from your company
negative	the goods were delivered damaged which stopped me getting the job_done .
negative	not good
negative	i placed a order with them and in 00_minutes i received a email .
negative	great right ..... wrong !!!
negative	the email say '_s i ordered for a 0000_subaru no way in hell i ordered for a 0000_subaru .
negative	checked my history on the pc and all it shows is 0000_subaru .
negative	try to actually talk to someone at parts_geek ... not going to happen .
negative	have to open a ticked which doesn_'_t get a response until 00 to 00_hours !!
negative	!
negative	when they do response it said i ordered for a 0000_subaru , not we can stop the order , change the order .
negative	so i finally receive the part , and now it cost me $_00 to send it back to them .. i '_ll never order from parts_geek again and made it clear to several on ' line forums and consumer complaint groups how their costumer service in non_- existence .
negative	stay_away from part geek period
negative	they are a racket .
negative	i believe they intentionally send the wrong part .
negative	you never speak to anyone just submit a ticket , i knew it was bogus and still made a purchase .
negative	you just paid for shipping , have to repay for shipping , restocking , repurchase , more shipping ; bullshit ..
negative	i liked the price , just didn_'_t like the fact that they weren_'_t able to send the right parts .
negative	i think i '_m just going to stick with the dealer for all parts since i know that i '_ll be able to get what i want even_though it '_s expensive .
negative	send the wrong part and wont answer my email or calls , will never order from here again
negative	after two_weeks and no merchandise rec ' d , i called to track order .
negative	they were holding order for items they said might never come in .
negative	but i had rec ' d an_email_asking me to rate their company .
negative	obviously they didn_'_t realize i had never rec ' d my order
negative	this site gives the impression it is uk based .
negative	it is not , it is actually based in denmark - which is not mentioned on ordering .
negative	you are only made aware of this by the fact the invoice you receive has a danish address .
negative	this adds on delivery time .
negative	not only that , but delivery times may state 0 - 0 days , customer_services claim it is actually 0 - 0 days .
negative	why not change your website to reflect this then ?
negative	last but not least , my item did not turn up anyway .
negative	so i '_m now going to have to go through the whole_process of trying to get my money back .
negative	their forum wall suggests i '_m not the only one .
negative	fun fun fun .
negative	i put my make , model and year into your site and ordered the part the site said was correct .
negative	then , was shipped the wrong part .
negative	when it was returned , i had to pay $_00 for shipping ...
negative	then , i was hit with a restocking_fee .
negative	no one answers the phone .
negative	this site is awful .
negative	i ordered a set of winter_tires 0 week prior to the christmas holiday break , paid the full_amount and paid_extra for fitting .
negative	the week prior to the break i received confirmation that the tires had been delivered to the garage that would fit them and was given the time of day that they would be fitted .
negative	as i had chosen a mobile_fitter i gave them a good few hours after they should have been fitted as i thought they could be busy on the lead up to christmas .
negative	when i called up blackcircles to ask what the hold up was , i discovered that they had not delivered the full set and would only be able to fit 0 of the 0 winter_tires , also the garage was now busy and wouldnt be able to fit them until the day after ( i was at a client site 000_miles_away from home and was due to drive home that night , so had to stay another day and another hotel bill ).
negative	i don_'_t know much about cars but i do know having two winter and two summer_tires fitted to a 000bhp car is not considered safe , but its all i was offered , that a refund and a very loose apology !
negative	if you want a guarantee that you will receive what you order , when you order i can not stress hard enough to give blackcircles a very wide birth .
negative	save_yourself , time , hassle and a potentially unsafe car and go local !
negative	rude bus driver who was insulting and threatening to customers .
negative	jeremy sanders is not a driver with appropriate demeanor for working in the tourism industry or in a job interacting with the public .
negative	bus_tour was good idea to see san_francisco but driver attitude ruined service for our large group .
negative	would recommend other bus / sightseeing service in san_francisco .
negative	funny_thing is that this driver was training another ticket taker today -- a real indictment of this company if they have such a person training anyone_else in customer service .
negative	after starting a booking for 0 days out , having to update my credit_card info must have changed the date to same day as booking !
negative	not realizing this , i book for the same day as booked , 00_minutes before the tee time that booked .
negative	i '_m an_hour from the course and booked from a laptop in my home .
negative	called and rep said , " sorry , that '_s the policy "!
negative	this was done before the tee time that day .
negative	i didn_'_t change the date , their system did !
negative	i mistakenly booked a room for the wrong night .
negative	i called travelocity and they called the hotel to explain the problem .
negative	the hotel told travelocity that they would not charge me for the room as they could see how the mistake could happen .
negative	i did not talk to the hotel_directly myself .
negative	when i checked my bank_account i was charged for the room anyway .
negative	cheap part , terrible customer service ... no 0000 human telephone #
negative	i ordered some dodge_truck parts and when i received them the packing_slip had the correct parts listed but the parts that came were for a honda_accord .
negative	i have been working with customer service to return the incorrect parts and get the correct parts for over a week but i only have gotten permission to return the parts that i ordered ( which i haven_'_t received and still want ).
negative	i will never order from parts_geek again .
negative	there return_policy sucks .
negative	i bought a samsung_galaxy 0 0 inch tablet for $_000 and the extended 0 year protection_plan of $_00 more from tigerdirect a few_months back .
negative	i broke the screen and took it back to the store for repair and i was told by the store that i needed to call the warranty company and send the unit back .
negative	the warranty company is called square_trade and the person i talked to was in pakistan .
negative	the person i talked to said his_name was ryan ( that was with a heavy_accent ), he told me that the tablet could not be fixed and they were sending me my money back $_000 for what i paid for the tablet once they had received the tablet .
negative	i asked why they couldn ’ t fix it and he said that it would cost more to repair it than what it cost .
negative	then he said that if it had cost $_000 to fix it then my warranty would only have $_00 left for future repairs .
negative	i asked to talk to his_supervisor and he said there were 0 of them but they were with clients and it would take 0 hours for me to get a response from them .
negative	i asked for one of the names of the supervisor and he gave_me the name sylvia ( remember this is a call_center in pakistan .
negative	i gave up dealing_with them and sent the tablet back .
negative	i have also been receiving a lot of junk_mail since i gave the rep my email address .
negative	they did send me a check for $_000 so i went to bestbuy and bought a new one and there warranty .
negative	i do not recommend tigerdirect or square_trade .
negative	i never received the card i ordered .
negative	you indicated that it had shipped but you promised a ' shipped ' email which was not received either .
negative	i can only assume it hadn_'_t shipped in the first place .
negative	i rate you zero !
negative	!
negative	they sent the wrong part , i paid postage to send it back , i thought they would send the right part they credited my card and charged me 00_% restock_fee and they don_'_t answer their phone don_'_t do_business with anyone you can '_t talk to do this first before doing_business with anyone
negative	please dont use this company , its a con .
negative	they sent me a battery that didn_'_t even fit my laptop .
negative	it had been opened and looked used .
negative	when i asked for a refund they said i could either return it at my cost ( to china ) or send it to the next unsuspecting buyer !
negative	i declined .
negative	i '_m 00 quid down .
negative	after spending thousands of pounds at mp over the years , ive went over to bulk_powders , who i whole heatedly recommend to everyone
negative	well , going by the online reviews , this company rocks .
negative	however , the real - life experience was more like having rocks dropped on me .
negative	i submitted an online order april 0 .
negative	first thing , i found out they got the lens order wrong .
negative	more money .
negative	an_additional $_000 . 00 .
negative	i got the glasses , and they were too big .
negative	so i returned them .
negative	now i have paid an_additional $ 0 . 00 .
negative	the balance is now over $_000 .
negative	all went well until i received an_email from them indicating that the exchange frames i ordered did not come in the size i wanted .
negative	turns_out the website does not have correct information .
negative	so now i settle for a temple size that is shorter than i wanted .
negative	the latest " revelation " is that they are going to discuss new fees with me .
negative	let_me be perfectly clear about one thing .
negative	if these are a bunch of crooks trying to squeeze my visa_card dry before giving me a facsimile of what i want i will be in touch with the north_carolina attorney_general consumer_protection division , filing a complaint with a complete transcription of emails , including dates and names .
negative	framesdirect will have roy cooper '_s people coming down on them with the full knowledge and expertise of us federal law governing interstate fraud .
negative	yes , that applies to texas as well .
negative	it is still a us state .
negative	have a nice day .
negative	i will not use or recommend eurocar !
negative	in fact i will go out of my way to discourage friends and clients fro using eurocar .
negative	i bought on the website , i was charged for the full_amount of my order and two_days_later without no_explanation or apology they sent me the invoice for two_thirds of what i had bought and told me that i will be refunded for the rest .
negative	when i contacted them they just replied with a line saying that some items where unavailable .
negative	if that was the true case , i shouldn_'_t have been able to buy them online on the first place .
negative	once the order arrived , one of the items was wrong .
negative	i did keep it though , paying it as a price to not deal with them anymore .
negative	i paid a lot of money for what i was expecting would be a quality suit , and received a very poorly fit suit of cheap material .
negative	after_contacting their support_ticket staff , my conversation with a man_named stefano was unhelpful and at times incoherent .
negative	the company refused to correct their mistake , which would do no_harm or extra_cost to them , and only take mere minutes of their time .
negative	i was hoping to buy more suits and clothing from them in the future , but i no_longer think that i want to do that !!
negative	!
negative	overall , don_'_t throw your money away on a suit with this company !!

negative	edit_: finally , when i had to leave for business and was going to be unavailable for a few weeks , somebody decided to take over the situation and help me .
negative	because of my leave ( over which i had no choice ), they closed their offer to help .
negative	very unprofessional company .
negative	will update should any changes occur .
negative	yodel was supposed to deliver a phone to me then apparently " attempted " delivery without leaving a calling card .
negative	i rescheduled , they didn_'_t deliver and said there was no log of a rescheduling .
negative	this continued for an entire week before they admitted they didn_'_t know where my parcel was .
negative	appalling .
negative	i have made 0 requests into customer service using the customer service option on the portal .
negative	neither one has generated a response .
negative	the 0st customer service request was to verify an order .
negative	since they never responded , i assumed my order did not complete correctly .
negative	i purchased from another local parts store .
negative	after 0 week , i received my original order from parts_geek .
negative	i now want to return the item .
negative	my 0nd customer service request was for an_rma and i followed the instructions on the portal .
negative	i have yet to receive a response .
negative	i only have 00 days to return the part , and have been waiting for a response from partsgeek .
negative	i ordered my gucci frames in december and 0 months later i had to order a different pair becuase they still weren_'_t in stock .
negative	after changing my order to a different frame , which was said to be in stock .
negative	it took another month to get this so called in stock item .
negative	i am used to getting my frames and glasses same day or at_least within a week .
negative	this is horrible service , and i won_'_t buy from framesdirect . com again .
negative	there was no consideration offered for my inconvenience .
negative	we booked a rental_car to collect when we arrived at pisa airport , saturday_morning 00 / 0 / 00 .
negative	autoeurope .
negative	the rental office was mobbed , crowds of people trying to get their rental_car from the europcar desk .
negative	no information on procedure , eventually found from another passenger that there was a ticketed queueing system .
negative	we had to wait over 0 hours , 00 people in front of us .
negative	total nightmare , never book this again .
negative	chaos .
negative	welcome to italy !
negative	!
negative	ordered item almost 00 days ago and a couple days_later it said it '_s shipped but no tracking_info was ever provided .
negative	item still_hasn_'_t arrived .
negative	fruugo says it should have arrived 0 - 00 days ago .
negative	all i get from fruggo is a form letter email_saying they are behind on their emails and to wait 0 days for an_email reply .
negative	already did that and still no reply .
negative	disputing transaction with paypal .
negative	purchase was based on photo .
negative	what i received was the same dorman brand junk you can find for half the price at your local_auto_parts store .
negative	burn me once and we ' re done ...
negative	i tried to get a reasonable deal on a " 0_star " hotel near the philly airport that priceline in its express_deals called similar to holiday_inn , best western or ramada_inn .
negative	what i got was the waterfront inn which was a run - down , dirty , tired motel with 0 floors , no elevators , promised internet but no wireless signal , an adjoining room door with broken locks that wouldn_'_t close completely , a room that wasn_'_t cleaned or the towels replaced on my second night , a toilet that never stops running water , a mattress that had to have been pre wwii and to top it off - a call for help got a " non_- responsive , unable to help , try the day shift manager - maybe they can help staff ".
negative	avoid this place like the plague .
negative	only stay here if your only alternative is sleeping in your car outside a crack house .
negative	did priceline help when i called ?
negative	not so much .
negative	they called the night manager who could not help , had no way to reach the gm and said call back tomorrow .
negative	so did i get another hotel until a refund could be worked out ?
negative	no .
negative	i '_m on my own until priceline can speak to the hotel gm tomorrow ... now that '_s customer service you can be proud of !
negative	not !
negative	a part i ordered was in damaged condition when i received it .
negative	when i checked the website for customer service i discovered their customer service was almost nonexistent .
negative	in order to get any kind of service a claim ticket must be completed and submitted for future contact via_e_-_mail .
negative	there is no phone_number listed to actually speak to somebody .
negative	i received an e_-_mail within a day and given directions for a return and refund .
negative	i had requested a telephone_call but was ignored .
negative	i returned the part today .
negative	they say a refund will be given within 00 days of receipt of the part .
negative	i '_m not optimistic .
negative	the refund was given quicker_than i thought .
negative	however , they refused to refund the shipping on the original order .
negative	so i paid $_00 to have a damaged part shipped overnight to me .
negative	i will not use partsgeek any more .
negative	dealing_with partsgeek was , and still is .
negative	.
negative	.
negative	a nightmare .
negative	when i first ordered on - line - no email_confirmation was sent .
negative	after waiting four days and still no confirmation - i tried to call the via_telephone .
negative	i tried three_times - with the same result .
negative	i got put on hold for near half an_hour each time with a message claiming " high phone traffic ."
negative	then - after a long wait i got another message_saying " we ' re not taking phone_calls - resolve the issue on - line ."
negative	seems their phone # is a work of fiction .
negative	i also tried to resolve via on - line support_ticket .
negative	again , i got nowhere and the few responses i received ( two_days_later ) seemed to be automated and not specific to the issues i ' d raised .
negative	i finally called my credit - card company and disputed the charges .
negative	eventually the part i ordered was delivered and now i find it does not even fit my vehicle .
negative	just for reference - i have a 0000_dodge_grand_caravan with 0 . 0 engine and awd .
negative	the part they list for my specific vehicle is incorrect .
negative	it is a centric brand and after_contacting centric - i found out they do not even sell the correct part for my van .
negative	note - my van has rear disk brakes and calls for a 0 " bore master_cylinder .
negative	centric only sells the 00 / 00 " bore unit used on vans with rear drum brakes - not disks .
negative	i '_m 00 years old and a professional mechanic .
negative	i '_ve been buying parts on - line since the internet first existed .
negative	this is by_far the worst buying experience i '_ve ever had .
negative	i am now on my 0th call to them .
negative	the other calls were all abandoned and i am now about to abandon this one after 00_minutes .
negative	apparently they are " doing all they can to help "
negative	i submitted my prescription but the lenses are blurry and don_'_t work as they should .
negative	i shall be going back to a high_street optician
negative	when i looked for a phone_number for the wabash inn and got your " 000 " number , i didn_'_t realize it was a reservation number that was going to charge me $_00 a night to book through it .
negative	i '_ll never do that again .
negative	i sure do feel stupid .
negative	fox rental_cars has no customer service and if i can save just one person from renting from them then my time has_been well spent .
negative	after trying to call them some 0 - 0 times and never being_able to reach anyone i e_- mailed them 0x .
negative	never receiving any response .
negative	bad fox .... bad fox
negative	rent from a different company if you can .....
negative	here are my emails to fox rental_car co .
negative	# 0
negative	i have been trying to talk to one of your representatives for the past 0 hrs now and am getting really tired of trying to reach you .
negative	maybe you need to hire more people .
negative	just a thought .
negative	i wanted to talk with someone re .
negative	toll payments on the golden gate bridge .
negative	i crossed on 0 / 0 / 00 and 0 / 0 / 00 so i believe that i own you for 0 toll payments .
negative	please call me at xxx - xxx - xxxx asap so we can resolve this .
negative	please contact me so that we can resolve this in a timely_manner so as to avoid any penalties .
negative	i will be happy to pay for my toll crossings but i will not pay for any incurred penalties .
negative	my 0nd email
negative	hi ,
negative	this is my 0nd_attempt to contact you re .
negative	crossing the golden gate bridge on 0 / 0 / 00 and 0 / 0 / 00 .
negative	i would like to pay for these 0 toll fees .
negative	i have been having problems contacting you by phone .
negative	i have tried_calling you and get to the part where it says to wait for a customer service rep .
negative	i hear the wait music and then beepbeepbeepbeepbeep .
negative	nothing .
negative	booking source was the internet
negative	this was my last e_-_mail to fox .
negative	to whom it may concern ,
negative	the purpose of this letter is to inform you of my sincere dissatisfaction with your company and it '_s lack of customer service .
negative	i rented a car from fox rental_cars for the first time on september 0 , 0000 at san_francisco international airport .
negative	the rental process went well and was fairly standard from my previous experiences with other car_rental_companies .
negative	however , i was never informed , nor asked about the possibility , of going over the golden gate bridge .
negative	i was unaware that i would not be able to pay a cash toll at the bridge until i was crossing it for the first time on september 0 , 0000 .
negative	i crossed the bridge again on september 00 prior to turning the care back in at fox .
negative	at that time i asked the attendant about the bridge tolls .
negative	he informed me to pay on line at goldengatebridge . com .
negative	i attempted to do so after returning home but was unable to pay just for the dates i crossed .
negative	calls to your company and emails attempting to pay the tolls have gone unanswered .
negative	of course , by now they have been charged to my credit_card along with a nice , fat " charge " from your company .
negative	this whole_process feels_like a scam and i am deeply upset and angry about how it has_been ( not ) handled .
negative	i will never rent a car from your company again and will tell_everyone i know not to as well
negative	i hope that this helps whoever is reading this
negative	i was charger 00 . 00 for a 00 . 00 toll .
negative	do not do_business with this company .
negative	if you call their customer service line and you won_'_t get a person to talk to .
negative	you '_ll get your voice_message transcribed to an_email .
negative	they sent my part to the wrong_address , and would not do anything to correct the problem .
negative	they told me to contact the party which they sent my part to 0000 miles_away from my address .
negative	thank_god for paypal or i would have been out $_000 . 00 .
negative	do yourself a favor and buy from a reputable_company .
negative	i booked a car_rental through auto_europe , who aligned me with europecar in portugal .
negative	they required full payment prior to departing on the trip .
negative	when i picked_up the car in lisbon , i was disappointed to see it was not even relatively new and was on empty .
negative	upon driving the car , i discovered mechanical problems and had to trade in this car for another .
negative	this second car was quite old , with almost 000 , 000 kilometers on it , and a tempormental transmission .
negative	later that day it began to rain and i discovered that both wiper_blades were totally worn out , making driving both dangerous and frustrating .
negative	after four days of this , i returned the car early , having paid for eight days .
negative	europecar agreed i was due a 00_% refund , but that i would have to get it from auto_europe in that i had prepaid fully with them .
negative	when i contact auto_europe for the refund , they refused .
negative	effectively , i paid twice the going rate for a car that was dangerous to drive .
negative	their representative indicated this was not their problem .
negative	they sent te wrong part , now im waiting 0_weeks to get a return_authorization from them .
negative	i will never deal with them again after this .
negative	they don_'_t pick_up the phone and hide
negative	behind email .
negative	el motor de búsqueda es bueno , pero no informan de_los cargos adicionales que las empresas de renting pueden o van a cargar posteriormente .
negative	yo no lo usaré más .
negative	i made a reservation for their four season '_s miami apartment , and i ended_up paying 000 usd per_night to four_seasons , as they don_'_t work with them .
negative	they sent me wrong parts , they sold me a part that weathertech isn_'_t even making yet , the part they sent me isn_'_t even on there website and after 0_weeks of emails i am no closer to getting the rma_# to return the part and get my money back .
negative	this has_been the most horrible experience ordering parts ever !
negative	not happy that the delivery lorry has damaged our brick pillar at the entrance to the drive and it has dislodged the pillar at the base with some bricks showing that they have been chipped on the corners
negative	screwed my prder up , missing a set of head_bolts , could never speak to anyone on the phone , customer service was a joke
negative	as is usual with every autoeurope rental .
negative	the vehicles are fine , clean and mechanically sound .
negative	but they never screen their distribution point offices for customer service or care .
negative	i have been scammed 0 different times in italy after renting a car through ae on - line !
negative	they always find a way of tacking on plenty of euros in additional_fees and taxes .
negative	this time in naples they zapped for an_additional 00 euro for local taxes and a whopping 00 euro for the 0 / 0 of a tank unfilled at the station in fuel .
negative	that 0 / 0 of a tank should have come to about 00 - 00 euro !
negative	when i challenged the counter clerks about this , they said , " we don_'_t speak - a dee english ."
negative	i will wait to rent when i get to the country location because auto_europe just does not get it !
negative	ordered tail_light for a ford_f000 .
negative	they were happy to charge my card , however i havent_seen a part yet , nor have i heard from partsgeek
negative	i did not get the lens when i needed them and still wait for them even_though it was a first_class delivery
negative	despite reserving months in advance , i arrived to find my requested car was not available .
negative	i had to rent a car from another company , resulting in a lot of wasted time , unnecessary stress and a second payment since my auto_europe voucher wasn_'_t transferable .
negative	now i am struggling to get a refund from auto_europe .
negative	do_business with these_people at your own_risk !
negative	ordered a mirror for my car .
negative	the initial site didn_'_t state there was a different one for the convertible version .
negative	i don_'_t have heated mirrors and what i received was heated .
negative	their description is wrong , and it won_'_t fit .
negative	searching further on the site i determined there was one for the convertible , also stated to be non_- heated .
negative	attempted to call .
negative	have spent serveral times on hold over 00_minutes , one time an_hour .
negative	once was put through and in the middle of talking was cut_off .
negative	over two dozen emails got me an_rma but not a correct mirror for replacement .
negative	i '_m guessing they are going to chagre me a restocking_fee for their error in the listing of the part .
negative	complete_waste of time , effort , and money .
negative	received an_email_confirming a reservation i never made , or wanted .
negative	don_'_t know who made a reservation in my name .
negative	i am waiting foy you to tell me if my credit_card was used .
negative	if it was it is fraudulent .
negative	i would think you would want to find out .
negative	you also said my account has_been charged .
negative	what account .
negative	what credit_card ?
negative	help .
negative	i pay extra_cost for fast deliver and i am still_waiting my rest parts
negative	i ordered some jet replacements on 00 october_0000 and when i was working with the online representative he stated the jets were in stock .
negative	however , it still took until 0 november for the items to be shipped .
negative	i kept trying to find out why my order was delayed and was told someone would get back to me and they never did until the jets were finally shipped a week_later .
negative	very disappointed in the costumer service .
negative	it took me at_least 0 tries just to checkout .
negative	terrible design of the ' cart '.
negative	if i could have rated it ' zero ' i would have .
negative	i will never shop_here again .
negative	booked a trip to disneyworld .
negative	they booked us through delta with a layover in atlanta .
negative	our flight from atlanta to florida was scheduled to leave six minutes after our arrival in atlanta .
negative	thank_god the flight was delayed , otherwise we would have missed our flight to orlando .
negative	the shuttle service desk was closed because we arrived after midnight and the kiosk wouldn_'_t scan our vouchers , so we had to pay $_000 to get our family to the hotel , one way .
negative	the agency allowed_us to book one bedroom for five people even_though it was against hotel policy .
negative	the hotel had to make an exception in our case because it was already booked .
negative	$_00 a night for a cot .
negative	our itinerary clearly read " 0room 0 beds for 0 people , breakfast included ."
negative	when we tried to redeem our breakfast vouchers the hotel pointed_out that they only ever assign two breakfast vouchers per room .
negative	something bookit was completely unaware of .
negative	first day of vacation and i am absolutely livid .
negative	the customer service representative i spoke with ( after an_hour of transfers and holds ) was completely rude and condescending .
negative	he refused to connect me to his_supervisor and would not even repeat his_name for me . this agency needs to gather accurate information about the companies they book , present all correct information to their customers , and treat their customers with respect .
negative	do not book with bookitnow .
negative	i will tell all my friends the same thing .
negative	when i first saw the reviews i thought that people was just trying to give the bad .
negative	ratings , that thry were unhappy ;, but honestly i wuoldnt used again ,, it is not worth it ,,, your $ 0 . 00 dollar savings with all the problems , and bad service ,, etc .. the your are going to get ,, so befor you do it think again ...
negative	same as above , you tell me .
negative	terrible .
negative	never will i use this site again .
negative	i '_ll be sure to spread the word .
negative	j ' ai déjà passé des commandes sur_ce site ras
negative	mais ma dernière commande du 0er mai je_l ' attends encore alors que mon compte est débité .
negative	pas_de nouvelle malgrés de nombreuses relances ...
negative	j ' ai ouvert un litige chez paypal qui s ' est transformé en réclamation .
negative	vraiment très mauvais qualité de service sur cette commande ..
negative	site à éviter
negative	sorry but today was past about 0 week from my payment and my order 0000 is never arrived ..
negative	still_waiting for order
negative	cjs - cd_keys ruined the diablo_0 release for me and my friends .
negative	first and last time i order here .
negative	it took me over a week to get an_rma to return a headgasket that arrived damaged .
negative	i need this gasket asap - the right thing to do would be to send me another one right_away .
negative	instead , they are not allowing me to exchange the product , they are making me return it for a refund .
negative	being tight with money and pressed for time , this is a nightmare .
negative	on top of this , i waited over a week for an_rma_number and they are not even offering to pay shipping for return or refund original shipping .
negative	so_far im frustrated .
negative	nobody seems to want to make this right and they have no phone_number to call .
negative	frankly im worried to order another gasket from them because if something_goes_wrong , it is a big time_consuming ordeal to make things right .
negative	worst customer service & shipping ever , will not buy from you ever again !
negative	wind up receiving the wrong ( parts ) waisted my time and money .
negative	stuck in philly and had to purchase new tickets .
negative	for triple what travelocity said they were " worth ".
negative	orbitz here i come .
negative	i mistakenly ordered a single bed , when i believed i had ordered a double .
negative	i didn_'_t realise until after the delivery .
negative	when i contacted bedworld to exchange it for a double , i was told it would cost me another £_000 for taking the single , delivering the double , and the extra toward a double .
negative	i was understandably distracted , as i had been staying in a hotel after my flat was repeatedly flooded , ruining my bed too , my flat was uninhabitable and i was in the middle of moving to a new flat .
negative	i am still without a bed and have had no help whatsoever from bedworld , as i don_'_t have £_000 to pay for 00 inches of bed , which is ridiculous .
negative	ala russell
negative	had a problem with a product no answer , product did not operate correctly , tried to contact company on two occasions no response , nothing , no interest , do not deal with this company as they have no customer service at all zero , nothing ,
negative	ron ritter dissatisfied customer big time , do not deal with them !!!!!!!
negative	you have been warned !!!!!!!!!!!!!
negative	!
negative	u send wrong parts all the time never will order from u again
negative	my $_000 + order was shorted two pressure gauges .
negative	i am not pleased with your customer service for my $_000 + order because :
negative	0 .
negative	my original order was shorted
negative	0 .
negative	there was a lengthy_delay shipping the missing item to me after you were notify of the shortage
negative	0 .
negative	you sent the wrong product because it was incorrectly described and incorrectly pictured a 00psi gauge on the web_site
negative	0 .
negative	after you agreed to refund my purchase on the gauges , you failed to credit my paypal_account for the incorrect gauges .
negative	if i had never check , your company would have screwed me out the cost of the incorrect gauges which was not the customers fault .
negative	00psi
negative	after all of that trouble in getting my order correct ... less the two incorrect gauges that were sent for the shortage for the maximum 00psi gauges ..... do you every think that i will order from doheny again ?????
negative	?
negative	likely not ......................
negative	doheny '_s water warehouse order 00000000
negative	000000 - 0000 - 000 replacement parts ref
negative	i got the box with parts a week_ago .
negative	i took my truck apart on saturday , and opened the box , no gaskets , no studs !
negative	so i put in a request on monday , no response for a week !
negative	i have a truck on stands for a week and no wheels !
negative	this is horrible response time and no follow through ...
negative	fuldstændigt umuligt at finde_ud_af hvordan administratorer , brugere , nøglekort , nøglefiler fungerer .
negative	og_deres service fakturerer mig 000 kroner for et værdiløst svar .
negative	tør ikke engang ringe igen selvom mit problem stadig_ikke_er løst .
negative	har_nu kæmpet med_det i 0 timer ...
negative	aaaaaaaaaaaaaaarg !!!
negative	!
negative	i ordered two seals .
negative	only one seal was shipped .
negative	your website shows both shipped , but my pack list shows only one was shipped .
negative	i asked for a refund since i had to buy from someone_else in order to fix my vehicle .
negative	i was not notified beforehand that i would not receive the part .
negative	i was told i woul receive a refund promptly .
negative	i checked my cc and it has not been refunded as i am writing this opinion .
negative	they wouldn_'_t ship to me because i had different shipping and billing addresses .
negative	i told them it had to be this way because no one is home to sign for the parts and they went_ahead and canceled the order rather_than work with me on getting this resolved .
negative	kinda sucks ..
negative	some of the parts i ordered were good but one did not show one was bent up one did not fit and one was half of a pair .
negative	i filled_out there return claim form no responce in a week .
negative	decided to call got disconnected ( there end ) called back was speaking to a guy and explaining my problem he then hung_up i tried back and got disconected again .
negative	decided to put under dispute .
negative	overall i wish i would have gone with one of the many local parts stores they ship in many items next_day for free and if it is the wrong parts you bring it back .
negative	the difference in local and online i later figured to be a few_bucks defently worth it .
negative	i ordered the part i needed and it came in a timely_manner , which was great .
negative	but , when i installed the part it did not work .
negative	i had to rush around to find a replacement and do the work on my wife '_s car at 00 : 00p at night .
negative	was not happy at all that the part i ordered and received did not work correctly .
negative	this experience has turned me off and i will not order from them again .
negative	too bad , too sad .
negative	bought rims from them they look correct tires fit put them on the car the center holes are too big the buick emblems will not fit i asked them if they can help me out all they did was say send them back after paying for a mounting and balancing and putting them on the car this is not an option i cannot get_ahold of a person to talk to only computer bs this company should not be in business a small refund or something would have at_least showed they cared but not letting_me talk to a human is the biggest insult to any customer never do_business with parts_geek !!
negative	!
negative	ordered a left and right fender well from parts_geek .
negative	site said there was 0 available for each one .
negative	got a email_saying parts were out of stock and didn_'_t know when they would be getting more they were just going to refund my money .
negative	if the site would have just said out of stock i wouldn_'_t have wasted my time and just went somewhere_else to begin with .
negative	i ordered part '_s on dec_00th and it '_s now the 00th and still no part '_s and you want to know how you did ?
negative	i ordered a replacement passenger_mirror for a 0000_subaru outback .
negative	the backing plate was defectively manufactured .
negative	the sockets were the balls on the actuator arms are supposed to snap in were made for show only .
negative	they weren_'_t even close to being functional and allowing the parts to snap in place .
negative	as manufactured , the mirror would not be able to be adjusted and would flop around .
negative	this caused me to have to use the old backing plate with the new glass .
negative	only problem was that the glass was not made to specifications of original glass so it did not fit .
negative	required lots of prying , scraping and filing to get the mirror_glass to fit .
negative	a piece of junk was all i received for my $_00 .
negative	order #_000000000 from 0 , october_0000 .
negative	never received not a single signal of the item .
negative	it began as usual - urgent short_term business trip to germany .
negative	i found good hotel in easytobook ( new for me ) an decided go with my wife and stay longer ( take a weekend ) to see cologne .
negative	it was not stated in the site that transaction would be done immediately after booking .
negative	i expected to pay on check - out and receive invoices ( that was my specific thing ).
negative	but it was not a problem .
negative	may be it was my inattention .
negative	i just needed invoices ( two invoices separated - for my company for official part of trip , and for me - for non_- official ).
negative	usually for any hotels or other booking companies it was not a problem .
negative	this was a long and awful quest with easytobook , hotels . com , ian . com .
negative	i received invoice .
negative	it was ok , but i clearly_stated that i need two_separate invoices for specified days .
negative	more requests on a site were without_success .
negative	countless calls to help - desk from moscow with just listening to music for half an_hour and reset after it .
negative	few_times i managed to talk to somebody .
negative	" your request is in progress ", was the answer during two_weeks .
negative	" give us just 00_hours or three_days in most complicated cases " was stated in request confirmation letter .
negative	most rude was yan .
negative	" it just not possible , we don_'_t provide such service ", was his answer .
negative	he refused to redirect call to manager or to financial dept .
negative	he refused to say his surname or id , or whatever .
negative	hi just said goodbye and hang_up .
negative	it is funny that after a tons of explanations for my company i received invoices that i asked for ( almost in a month from initial request ), but it was useless as period was closed already .
negative	thus what does it mean ?
negative	it was most terrible and rude call - centre i ever meet .
negative	i don_'_t know who trained these boys and girls on duty in customer service dept .
negative	why they don_'_t know that is possible and that is not ?
negative	why they cannot do something that is really easy ?
negative	why they cannot redirect call to person that can really solve the problem ?
negative	or may be it is the company policy ?
negative	i actually don_'_t want to investigate .
negative	i would just avoid dealing_with this company .
negative	be for warned
negative	no customer service at all , none
negative	i am sorry i trusted this site
negative	don_'_t you be
negative	never again .
negative	i never received the part .
negative	post_office did not deliver , they sent part back without my permission .
negative	filled_out form at parts_geek no response to my complaint .
negative	i bought a power_steering_rack and sent in my old rack for a core_charge , $_000 .
negative	the rack from partsgeek failed after only 0 , 000miles and to get a refund i have to send in the rack , but partsgeek will not return my core or the corecharge .
negative	so now partsgeek has two cores ( my original one and the one i bought from them ) and i have none .
negative	i '_ll have to pay the core_charge to purchase another power_steering_rack anywhere , including from partsgeek !
negative	beware if you ' re buying anything with a core_charge .
negative	they '_ll rip you off .
negative	order shipped was incorrect - not even close to ordered part number or correct vehicle
negative	customer service is unresponsive .
negative	only rec ' d system generated email responses that they will get back to me in 0 - 0 business days , it has_been 0 business days ( 0 days total ) and no response other than system saying they got the message left on web_site ,
negative	would not purchase parts from this outfit again under any circumstances !!
negative	!
negative	i order a part was charged 000 . 00 then a week_later got another email_stating they were out of stock and the order was canceled but never got refunded and can not get_ahold of them on the phone or email .
negative	do not order anything from them now i am disputing it with my credit_card company .
negative	at first i was excited to order from parts_geek with all the incentives of fast shipping and great pricing .
negative	once received the part i went to install it and the transmission_mount was made incorrectly and caused the bolts to cross thread into my transmission ....
negative	it was a design flaw .... now i not only have the wrong part .... i have to have the threads re - tapped by a machinist .
negative	i sent parts_geek and " customer_support_ticket " and a explanation of my situation .
negative	the sent me an ra number with no apology and stated i am responsible for the shipping back .... after trying to contact them by phone ..... " good luck "!
negative	i would wait 00 min on the phone then the the irv stated i should fill_out a ticket and submit it via internet due to heavy call_volume ... hummmm this has_been the same response i have received all week .
negative	i would then submit a customer_support_ticket .... multiple_times ... no response !
negative	i briefly explained my situation and asked them to please call me in regards .. etc .
negative	and left my contact number .
negative	i have worked for home shopping network customer service and after having this type of customer service i will never order from parts_geek again !
negative	i will tell_everyone the same !
negative	horrible horrible horrible customer service !!!!!!!!!!
negative	for better words .. no customer service ....
negative	i booked a room under the supposition that your advertising as " lowest online room rates " was actually true , but was sorely disappointed .
negative	the country_inn & suites in east troy , wisconsin told me after the fact that they could have booked the same room through the country_inn website for $_000 . 00 including all fees and taxes by using my aarp discount .
negative	your website charged me $_000 . 00 and change for the same room .
negative	further , the response to my email_requesting the aarp discount from your website was , in essence , that i had to work out that discount directly with the hotel location .
negative	so you are not only the lowest priced , but also proceeded to pass the buck and claim no responsibility when i gave you the opportunity to actually be the lowest_price option .
negative	i will avoid ever booking through reservationcounter again , and plan to tell all of my family and friends to do the same .
negative	i will never ever use hostel_world again !!!
negative	hostel_bookers have got you beat , you might as well give up right now unless you very very quickly get your act_together !!!
negative	!
negative	i ordered a cooling_fan for my 0000_vw_jetta .
negative	i paid a certified mechanic to install the fan .
negative	he noted during the install that the fan would not spin freely and that i should return the fan for a new one .
negative	appareently parts_geek does not answer the phone anymore because
negative	they are to busy .
negative	you have to make a
negative	claim online for returns , or for whatever problem you may have .
negative	after 0_weeks and 0 emails , i have not received a return order .
negative	i am so disappointed as i feel they ripped me off $_000 . 00 .
negative	buyer_beware parts_geek had a d rating on the bbb and numerous one star_ratings elsewhere .
negative	ordered a number of large valie electrical items which have been paid for .
negative	no communication from electricshop as to state of delivery .
negative	have had to phone twice to be told goods where due to be delivered into their warehouse the following_day - only to then phone a week_later to be advised they were due to be delivered the same week - still not recieved goods 00 days after ordering and although delivery promised for friday - i am not hopeful .
negative	didn_'_t fit in the first place and broke as soon as i drove my car again ...
negative	junk !!!
negative	do not buy
negative	received the bed two_weeks_ago not received the mattress no communication_regarding where it is or when it is coming ???
negative	?
negative	i received an e_-_mail last night @ 0 : 00 stating , if . i made a reservation today , i should call your customer setvice for a $ 0 . 00 discount .
negative	i was told .. i was not eligible for the discount , because it was aol '_s problem
negative	don_'_t buy goods from them .
negative	they take_forever to ship .
negative	this is not the first time this has happened .
negative	when you contact them , they give you the same generic response .
negative	this last order is going to take almost 0_weeks to get to me .
negative	it '_s not enough they claim 0 and half weeks .
negative	( which i think is not right ) we ' re a small company of 00 and can manage shipping 0000 orders a day .
negative	i ordered fog_lights and a third_brake_light for my 0000_gmc yukon on december 00 , 0000 . i received foglights december 00 , 0000 , but as of yet i do not have brake_light_assembly january 0 , 0000 . i have responded via_e_-_mail to customer service three different times , as of yet no parts , no phone_call . customer service is not an e_-_mail . customer service is a phone explaining how parts_geek can resolve my parts issue .
negative	if you don_'_t call please return my money .
negative	vincent aiosa
negative	i really wish they would have more complete descriptions and more photos of the parts being sold .
negative	things like " this part only fits these car models .
negative	i was also dissatisfied that they cancelled my order because of a back log !
negative	oh well found the same part at ebay .
negative	oh one more thing ... why on earth is there a 00_% restocking_fee if i have to send back the part ?
negative	bullshit ... just so i don_'_t have to deal with some idiotic part geek customer service rep i have decided to put my part up for auction at ebay instead of returning it to parts_geek . com
negative	добрый день !
negative	покупали на tripsta . ru билеты из иркутска на о . сайпан со стыковкой в сеуле еще в октябре .
negative	через некоторое время авиакомпания сдвинула рейсы на один день и стыковка получилась очень неудобная , т . к .
negative	приходилось оформлять визу в корею .
negative	просили их поменять билет на другое направление , но мне ответили , что авиакомпания , которая выписывала билеты , ничего поменять не может - только вернуть деньги .
negative	поэтому решили отказаться от этой поездки и вернуть полную стоимость .
negative	со мной сразу связалась девушка , сказала что все будет ок , полный возврат сделаем .
negative	00 . 00 . 00 бронь была аннулирована , сказали , что деньги придут в течение 00 дней .
negative	прошло уже 00 дней , а денег я так и не получил - а сумма там совсем не маленькая !!!
negative	по телефону каждый раз говорят , что либо система не работает , либо бухгалтеры разберутся , либо " нужно еще некоторое время , связанное с банковскими операциями "..
negative	по истечении 00 дней связался с авиакомпанией , ответа которой мне достаточно для успешного судебного дела !
negative	в случае отсутствия адекватной реакции со стороны tripsta в ближайшее время , переписка с авиакомпанией будет обнародована и я буду подавать в суд на эту компанию .
negative	так же будут проинформированы все компетентные органы в нашей стране и греции , на территории которой данная компания зарегистрирована .
negative	tried to return a defective_part and they dont answer to calls .
negative	now im stuck with this defective_part and cant return it .
negative	i went to pick_up my car at the office on william street in central business district of sydney .
negative	the clerk was rude and they did not hold my reservation for two hours past the time i was supposed to arrive .
negative	hello !
negative	i '_m on airplane .
negative	i can '_t predict if it '_s going to be late or not .
negative	i didn_'_t know how much time would take exactly to get from the airport to their location .
negative	after being told that my reservation had been canceled and that the car was not available at the quoted rate , i ended_up making other arrangements .
negative	this has to be the worst car_rental experience i '_ve ever had on any continent .
negative	i would advise anyone just steer_clear of using this company .
negative	awful awful awful !
negative	the e_mail responses i received were totally illegible .......................... totally_unacceptable
negative	i ordered beetle juice extra large out fit .
negative	i tried it on but jacket was too tight .
negative	i didn_'_t have time to return it and couldn_'_t find larger_size on internet so we tried to adjust , but still no luck then discovered it was actually standard size and the packaging clearly_stated xl so really unhappy as useless outfit and surplus wig and had to get something else instead .
negative	do nor ask when product not received .
negative	ordered flowers and champagne to be delivered to my wife on her_birthday while vacationing in florence with our kids ( i had to work ), but the order was never delivered .
negative	floraqueen says local vendor claims address was wrong .
negative	i verified address was correct and someone was there all day but they refuse to refund .
negative	parts_geek has great prices .
negative	that is the only positive thing i can say about them .
negative	having purchased from parts_geek in the past , i was pleased to see a decent price on a coolant temp .
negative	sensor for my 0000_mazda .
negative	but then i noticed something odd .
negative	the price displayed when up a little_bit when i put it in the cart .
negative	wanting to see what was going on , i opened another page , and tried it again , - same thing - it added a few dollars to the price .
negative	i am not saying this was intentinal or malicious , but i am not saying it isn_'_t either .
negative	just watch for this .
negative	then when i hit " place order " the system went and put both shopping_cart items in and the total was doubled .
negative	ugh .
negative	i started right then trying to correct it bus guess what ?
negative	all the 000 phone numbers , for sales , customer service etc .
negative	are all just recordings telling you to submit a ticket from the web_site .
negative	they even lie and say " call_volume is heavy " not bloody likely since each menu choice is a dead end , telling you to use the web_site and disconnecting the call .
negative	nest i tried email - every address they send from is set to not receive incoming mail .
negative	and you can only submit one ticket .
negative	i was promised a call in 00_hours ( too_late already to remove the duplicate , unneeded item .
negative	i got another email_saying " your transaction went through !
negative	yay !
negative	now i have been over charged .
negative	then , as i expected , i get the " your order has shipped !"
negative	great .
negative	how about responding to my multiple_attempts to reach someone , anyone to prevent shipping me a double order ??
negative	nope .
negative	them after i get the double order , i get a response , and two_days_later i get an_rma - guess what ?
negative	i have to pay the return shipping .
negative	further they state a turnaround for rma of 00 days !!!
negative	it took 0 seconds to debit my account , but they want 00 days to refund me .
negative	it '_s a load of bs .
negative	companies like amazon would never have shipped the wrong order to begin with , and would never expect customers to wait a month to be credited for their mistake .
negative	never again parts_geek ; i don_'_t need a companies that i can '_t reach when there is a problem , especially one that has practices like switching prices in the cart , and making customers pay return shipping .
negative	until they change these horrible methods i would suggest you give parts_geek a wide berth - do not purchase from this company - do not give them your business .
negative	they are a long way from companies that respond to their customers .
negative	read the fine_print .... hard rock hotel only had queen_beds left when king_bed was booked .
negative	next hotel booked and confirmed on trip did not have any reservations for us ( we were on our_honeymoon ).
negative	luckily they still had rooms available !
negative	ordered windshield_wipers for mercedes s - 000 as they were advertised on the website .
negative	order arrived with wipers that can not be installed on s - 000 .
negative	contacted seller , sent them pic of the wipers needed .
negative	several days_later rec ' d order to ship it back .
negative	asked for pre_- paid label to return item , but was told that it is my responsibility to return wrong item .
negative	tried to call several_times : no live support .
negative	company itself assigned return_authorization under " wrong item shipped " title , but still refused to reimburse shipping .
negative	interesting , that one email requested that i will provide them with part item number , so that can check their inventory , but these wipers are still advertised as for s - 000 .
negative	after this experience , i had no time to wait for another shipment from different online_retailer and went to dealership to by wipers .
negative	i told your representative that i needed to upgrade to a car that would comfortably seat 0 people and their luggage .
negative	she said she had the perfect car and i paid the additional_fee .
negative	the car was small and uncomfortable .
negative	she also said the car had a small_dent in the right / rear fender and she documented the dent .
negative	i was given a hassle when i turned the car in at avis because of this dent .
negative	i therefore will not give you any more of my business .
negative	i ordered an automatic_transmission_cooler from partsgeek . com .
negative	the package looked intact from the outside but when i opened the box i noticed that the cooler was not only warped , but someone had bent the mounting_brackets down as to fit the cooler in a smaller box .
negative	the box had no damage and the brackets were strong_enough that they would '_ve atleast cut the box had it been damaged in transit .
negative	atleast i know who to not order parts from now .
negative	they sold me a part that wasn_'_t in stock ( though it was listed as in - stock ).
negative	waited two_days to inform_me that it was backordered .
negative	boo for you partsgeek , your poor stock records cost me a week of delays .
negative	the process of getting ve prescription approval is fubar !
negative	no follow - up to see if fax was received and no one seems to really care !
negative	0_weeks to complete an order is not what i would call good service and i don_'_t care that the fax was down .
negative	i will probably never order from this company again and will warn all my friends and other pet_owners to stay_away !
negative	it was not till a package was late that i started looking at reviews .
negative	wish i had before , will not be using again .
negative	i received a defective_part and i have to pay $_00 . 00 to rerturn when the part was $_000 . 00 i think this is very bad business .
negative	if i had ordered the wrong part i can understand , but it is defective .
negative	i even called the manurfacturer and was told to send back for an even exchange .
negative	i think i will call the manufacturer again and let them know how bad this company is treating there customers .
negative	i will never buy from them again .
negative	este site ( go0 . fr ) não oferece suporte nenhum no pós - venda aos seus clientes .
negative	comprei 0 correntes que , por causa de uma embalagem danificada ( falha da loja go0 ), retornaram para o país de origem - frança , ou seja , não recebi meus itens e nem meu dinheiro de volta .
negative	o pessoal da go0 sequer tiveram o profissinalismo de me reenviar o material , ou me devolver o dinheiro , ou me oferecer o valor em outros produtos ... enfim , fui enganado e o site não estabeleceu mais contato comigo sobre o caso ( em suma tomei um belo de um balão ).
negative	só me resta alertar as pessoas sobre o total descaso deste site ( go0 . fr ) em relação aos seus clientes ... fica a dica !!
negative	( não comprem )
negative	-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
negative	this website ( go0 . fr ) does not provide any support on the " after sale " for their customers .
negative	i bought 0 chains and , because of a damaged packaging ( fault of go0 ), the post_office returned the chains to the country of origin - france , so i never received my items and the go0 staffs do not have an professional attitude to offer me the option to give my " money back " or resend the 0 chains ( again ) or offer me the value in discounts or some others products of the website ...
negative	finally , i '_m felt " stolen " and the webstore after a few e_-_mails never more established contact with me about the issue ( and i just realized that i was stolen ).
negative	so i can only warn people about the disregard of this site ( go0 . fr ) in relation to their customers .
negative	-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
negative	ce website ( go0 . fr ) ne fournit aucun support sur_les " après vente " pour leurs clients .
negative	j ' ai acheté 0 chaînes et , à cause d ' un emballage endommagé ( faute de go0 ), le bureau de poste renvoyé les chaînes vers le pays d ' origine - france .
negative	donc je_n ' ai jamais reçu mes articles et l ' equipe de go0 n ' ont pas une attitude professionnelle pour m ' offrir la possibilité de me " remboursé " ou renvoyer le 0 chaînes ( de nouveau ) ou m ' offrir la valeur des remises en produits du site ... enfin , je me sentais " volé " et_la webstore après quelques e_-_mails de contacts plus jamais établi avec moi un contact sur la question ( vraiment j ' ai_été volé ).
negative	donc , je_ne peux que mettre en garde les gens sur_le mépris de_ce site ( go0 . fr ) par rapport à leurs clients .
negative	would not recommend this company to anyone .
negative	let the buyer_beware is the best caution with this company .
negative	to purchase is easy , to return is very very difficult
negative	i should not have to pay shipping !!!!
negative	!
negative	the prices were good but i called over 00 times and nobody ever ansered the telephone after i let it right for over 00_minutes and i email to inquire_about the status of my order .
negative	it was well over a week before i got a response telling_me that the air_filters would be shipped in a couple of weeks .
negative	terrible communication and i inquired if this was a legitimate company .
negative	wouldn_'_t let_me spend more than 00 $ or something .
negative	very frustrating .
negative	charged 00 . 00 for next_day delivery took the weekend and two full days to process and then shipped two day took a full 0 days for the gift to be delivered , called and complained that standard shipping would have been faster they ignored me and almost laughed me off the phone horrible insincere customer service ..
negative	i will never use this service again !
negative	this is the second time ive ordered , and the second time the wrong part was sent . 00 . 00 in return postage i have had to pay .
negative	my buisiness is growing in leaps and bounds .
negative	parts_geek could care less .
negative	they will never get a dime of my buisness !
negative	i ordered 000 . 00 dollars worth of parts that said they were direct replacement part all except my cars computer wouldn_'_t reconize them therefore worthless .
negative	than partsgeek wont responed so i can return them .
negative	never ever do_business with these crooks .
negative	should have done my research better and i would have seen there is no direct way to contact them
negative	installed part , the road test the set button would not set speed , the unit would not shut
negative	off then the set button fell out removed unit from car and trashed it .
negative	bought one locally job_done !
negative	neither of the 0 eyeglasses that i ordered turned_out like i thought .... it was foolish to buy eye_wear online , as it needs to be tried on first ..... both pair a total waste of money .
negative	never again ..
negative	£_00 discount !!!
negative	if you book a flight before such and such date use code " blablabla " very visibly advertised before the choice of flight , but when paying for the flight there is a very clever trick to rip you off :
negative	step0 : distraction - at check out page when i entered the code to get my happy £_00 discount and was informed that the code ain '_t valid .
negative	bollocks i thought to myself , and proceeded with booking not wishing to spend any more time interacting with a computer .
negative	step 0 : hide the £_00 service charge and cash in on unsuspecting travelers , who only find out they paid £_00 more for their flight then the price advertised .
negative	you will be pleased to know that this business model does not discriminate between black and white , green and orange , buddhist and hindi , and not even between the filthy rich and those_who spend months saving up for that one yearly trip ... oh why am i even writing this , ain '_t nothing gonna change ...
negative	add my experience to another " lost in the mail ."
negative	after 00 days since shipping out , i looked at the tracking_info and it had stalled at the main post_office in san_antonio 00 days earlier .
negative	there was no update after that and i didn_'_t get the package .
negative	contacted redbubble via their chat_feature and was told to go check at the post_office .
negative	what is this , 0000 ?
negative	my neighborhood has plenty of shared mail boxes for parcel deliveries so i doubt they couldn_'_t fit two stickers in one of them , if not my personal mailbox , and i didn_'_t get any notice for pickup .
negative	but they wanted me to go stand in line and ask anyway .
negative	then the redbubble rep told me to give it another 0 days .
negative	look , the last tracking update occured 00 miles from my house 00 days ago .
negative	i don_'_t think 0 more days ( for a total of 00 days ) is going to make a difference .
negative	but in the redbubble universe , i guess this is how things work .
negative	seems like a lot of items get lost for some reason , but since they couldn_'_t just resend my $ 0 . 00 order on the spot , i don_'_t think they ' re too worried_about customer retention , so i '_m done with that site .
negative	thought i was reserving with fairfield_inn .
negative	bought something .
negative	it did not match the photo on the website .
negative	i asked for a refund and they said i had to send it back to china .
negative	so i paid shipping to send back to china .
negative	they kept the item and refused to refund my money back .
negative	they have not responded to my emails .
negative	sent me the wrong part ... would not answer emails or phone_calls .
negative	these_folks are trouble !!
negative	!
negative	no key , no support , no money .
negative	this store should be closed
negative	one part was described wrong that i purchased and they would not exchange it without me paying all shipping and restocking_fee .
negative	three other parts did not fit at all and i asked for a refund .
negative	no response .
negative	no contact number .
negative	trashy products .
negative	usually very satisfied - but not this time .
negative	one order , came in 0 boxes , the last being tracked on fedex then mysteriously transferred to usps .
negative	i always confirm fedex since usps does not deliver to my house .
negative	this added days to my order which cost me money .
negative	i bought the parts elsewhere in the meantime .
negative	if i was not able to get to the small post_office in my town during business hours , and didn_'_t know them personally they would have returned the package .
negative	response from partsgeek was merely " thanks for your inquiry " no apology , no nothing .
negative	i order thousands of dollars in parts each month .
negative	i will remember this service each time .
negative	see my opinion above , but i do expect that the experience will be excellent !.
negative	will be able to comment further at the end of the trip .
negative	this sight was a rip_off .
negative	too high and would not let_me use my aarp discount , trash .
negative	would not recommend or refer this sight .
negative	i ordered a black_ink_cartridge , and color_cartridge for my printer .
negative	the color works good , the black will not work .
negative	i have not heard back from them yet .
negative	i wont be buying reused ink from them again !
negative	placed order with partsgeek . com on monday_morning .
negative	thursday_evening they canceled the order with no_explanation .
negative	the 000 number listed in the email never leads to a human .
negative	horrible customer service .
negative	i ordered spark_plug_wires for a 0 . 0l v - 0 .
negative	i got six wires and could not find a way to make them work .
negative	when you by a part and it is defective and not your fault you should not have to pay for shipping the part back and on top of that reorder and pay full price again and by that i mean part and core fee because they already have my core for the first order so how can i produce another core when they have it already so now i have paid shipping for core and two defective parts and still with out a car for a month now plus had to pay repair place three time for installation and there is no number to call customer service at parts_geek
negative	will not respond to direct inquiries .
negative	i had to initiate a call to find out that the item was backordered and they had no status .
negative	you think they would have noted that on the web - site at time of purchase .
negative	deceptive !
negative	you will be better served to use another merchant !
negative	you did not deliver when i asked so the flowers were going off at the time they were required .
negative	not very impressed .
negative	i saw the add of 0 for 0 and decided to buy at what i thought would be a bargain price .
negative	i ' d previously bought one of the items for under_£_00 , but didn_'_t check this before jumping in to buy 0 more .
negative	what i didn_'_t notice was that hq hair had jacked_up this price to £_00 . 00 each !
negative	i paid £_00 . 00 ( they cleverly worked out the individual price to be £_00 . 00 and multiplied it by 0 - it should have been £_00 . 00 - but the extra 0p is not the point here ).
negative	the point is that not very long ago i paid less_than £_00 each , which would have made my bill under_£_00 .
negative	hq hair have ripped me off to the tune of £_00 !!!!
negative	how could they treat a loyal_customer like that ?
negative	clearly i should have been more careful of their underhand pricing methods .
negative	i '_ll be on the look out in future .
negative	their deals had better be good or they will_definitely be losing my business ( if they haven_'_t already !!)
negative	totally inadequate questioning of my id and credit_card for payment of hotel reservation . inexcusable . i have been using the same credit_card . for years for hotel reservations , etcyou have to review your checking procedures because they are wrong and offensive for users like me .
negative	alejandro foxley
negative	i booked a hostel , then the hostel canceled on me the day i was supposed to arrive .
negative	they told me there was no space and to refund the deposit i had to talk to hostel_world .
negative	i did , i exchanged a few emails and they told me tough_luck .
negative	i want to be clear that i did not cancel , the hostel canceled on me and hostel_world left me hanging .
negative	dont give them your credit_card info , i no_longer trust them .
negative	i ordered a intake_manifold for 00 buick park_avenue , part geek said they had one in stock at $_000 . 00 they took my credit_card and notified me that payment was cleared .
negative	then 0 days_later they say they are going to refund my money which a few_days_later they did , minus the insurance cost .
negative	however they still had the same part listed as " one in stock " but for $_000 . 00 .
negative	i call so called customer service and " on hold " for nearly 00_mins was cut_off .
negative	i got unaceptable explaination from e_-_mails .
negative	i would not recommend this " business ?"
negative	to anyone_who needs a part quickly .
negative	it appears they are run by a bunch of inept children who are playing at business
negative	the price is good , but i wasn_'_t told the shuttle was leaving , and by the time i got to the airport , my name was being called .
negative	the plane had already boarded .
negative	they were waiting on me .
negative	received the wrong part .
negative	can only contact them through " support_ticket ".
negative	did so .
negative	received e_-_mail confirmation that i will be contacted in 00 to 00_hours .
negative	it has_been 0 days still no contact .
negative	i have made repeated_attempts to contact them .
negative	very unhappy .
negative	simply dreadful .
negative	i wanted to purchase bt sport on my sky tv .
negative	the automated service options all required entering a bt number , which i don_'_t have .
negative	i was then re routed through various departments and had to call back four times to resolve the order .
negative	was told the channel would be activated immediately on placing the order .
negative	was subsequently told it could take up to 00_hours .
negative	was told on another call that an incorrect viewing card was on the order .
negative	rang back and was told the viewing card was correct .
negative	by the time the channel was up and running i ' d missed the event that i wanted to watch .
negative	i also think the advertising of the channel is misleading - no mention of an extra_charge for hd or a hefty activation charge .
negative	later in the day i reported a possible fault on my 00 year_old mother '_s phone line .
negative	was told i ' d be rung back once checks had been made .
negative	no call back was received and i had to ring again .
negative	overall a simply awful and frustrating experience .
negative	not impressed as a customer or shareholder .
negative	certainly wouldn_'_t recommend to anyone .
negative	the customer service cannot do a single thing for you .
negative	they just send your email to some supervisor who apparently responds to one issue a day .
negative	haven_'_t been able to use my card in over a week .
negative	customer service on the phone is full of apologies and no answers .
negative	reporting you guys to the better business buro stop running the company out of your grandmothers basement .
negative	why would you cancel my order and not even notify me ?
negative	i need this really bad and lost a lot of time .
negative	i found you cancelled my order when tracking it .
negative	no reason to cancel ; maybe you were out of stock
negative	after having tried for two times for my requested refund , i still couldn ’ t get a clear answer .
negative	that ’_s asos for you !
negative	my order for a few shorts and tees were so poorly met , i wondered on what makes them a name in business .
negative	for those_who are looking to shop better , i guess fsession is actually a better choice .
negative	although they are just about five years old , i loved the quick shipping and packaging , plus no_complaints for the products sent !
negative	honestly , i shopped so much on asos that i am surprised at their poor services .
negative	it ’_s fsession for me all the way !
negative	i still_haven_'_t received my merchandise
negative	i was disappointed in how long it took to receive the part i ordered .
negative	when i received the part , the part numbers didn_'_t match and i looked it up on another website (" rock_auto ") and it showed that the part had a motor on ( the window_regulator ) compared to the one i received (" which didn_'_t have a motor on it ", it was drilled out and the wrapping that it came in was ripped open , like it had sent out and sent back to you ) but my customer wanted to keep it and use the motor off it his old broken one !.. by luck the motor was still good ?
negative	normally , the place which i deal with delivers parts within 0 to 0 days and 0 days at_least by ground .
negative	compared to your system .
negative	so overall , i was dissatisfied and will go back to buying from " rock_auto ."
negative	puuuuuuutoooooosssssssss
negative	i later found the same lg battery for $_00 . 00 and a generic replacement for $_00 . 00 on another website .
negative	you better believe i don_'_t want to get any more mail from you and i doubt i '_ll .
negative	buy anything_else from you .
negative	i ordered 0 window cranks for a geo metro .
negative	cost $ 0 . 00 each .
negative	i only received 0 in the shipping box .
negative	there was no receipt or other documentation of what was shipped in the box .
negative	i have sent 0 or 0 emails and responded to various inquiries .
negative	the simple solution would be to send another crank or refund the cost of 0 crank , which i was billed for 0 .
negative	but to date , partsgeek is conducting some bizarre inquiry that will cost them more then just sending another part oir refunding $ 0 . 00 .
negative	i bought an item on ebay and had significant issues with the buyer who sent the wrong item and wouldn_'_t rectify .
negative	i flagged the issue in my feedback to warn others whilst being objective .
negative	ebay unilaterally removed the poor rating at the request of the seller to protect their reputation , but did so without_any reference to me .
negative	i was left on the receiving end of poor service and ebay refused to help .
negative	first .
negative	wrong name .
negative	second .
negative	i asked to use my points at the hotel since i am a diamond member .
negative	the agent charged me $_000 . 00 without authotization to expedia .
negative	i had to reverse all the charges back .
negative	third . never received any info back on my reservation status . when arrived to the hotel , big surprise !.
negative	i would never use these_guys .
negative	expedia and hyatt should be sick to have this company as a partner .
negative	they mislead you to believe you are actually dealing_with hyatt direct with deceptive website .
negative	they lied about a second party being_able to check in with a photo_id only despite fully charging my credit_card in advance .
negative	their call_center in honduras hung_up on me twice trying to resolve issue and said a supervisor wasn_'_t available .
negative	they are liars .
negative	their contact info on the american_express billing was a fax line .
negative	i have filed a disputed charge investigation with american_express .
negative	hyatt customer_relations indicated this wasn_'_t the first issue with this company .
negative	after 00 years of staying with hyatt , i will quit if they don_'_t support me on this .
negative	i don_'_t think it is right for them to send the " wrong part their mistake " and expect me to pay for all shipping ?
negative	i don_'_t think so ...
negative	jeg oprettede en konto hos unibet , og ifølge den skulle jeg få_et gavekort til unisport i løbet_af 0 - 00 hverdage .
negative	det endte med at der gik knapt 0 måneder , før_jeg_fik mit gavekort , og_det_var først efter flere henvendelser jeg_fik det .
negative	derudover er_deres live_chat aldrig åben , selvom de skriver at de bestræber sig på at holde den åben hele_tiden .
negative	deres svartider er_også helt uacceptable , hvis_man skriver en mail til_dem under deres åbningstid , er_det end ikke sikkert at de svarer før efter et_par dage .
negative	i was involved in a accident where my back taillight was damaged and immediately wanted it fixed so came to partsgeek . com .
negative	i had never bought from them but the prices looked good .
negative	i received a box a week_later expecting a taillight and instead received a mirror for a truck .
negative	i came to find out that i had to e_-_mail about the mix_up and couldn_'_t phone in .
negative	i received an e_-_mail back saying that i would have to send it back and pay for shipping due to their complications .
negative	currently .... 0 and a half weeks after i bought the taillight i am still_waiting on e_-_mails so i can send the part back .
negative	even worse is that they do not have an exchange program setup so i will have to just reorder the tailight instead of them just sending me what i really need .
negative	i would rather instead of " credit " that i would just have a full_refund so i can deal with someone_else .
negative	i am confused as to how this company is ran without a knowledgeable call_center .
negative	i feel_like things would get taken_care of a lot faster for people like me that need the part asap if there were a phone service offered .
negative	i am very disappointed and hope that something gets done fast .
negative	my irritation level is growing more and more everyday i receive an e_-_mail that seems generated by a computer instead of a caring person that understands that i need the part and not just want it .
negative	we purchased a mattress here to move our daughter into a " big girl bed ".
negative	a few_days after making the purchase , we found out my parents had a mattress and box spring we could have for free .
negative	we tried to return the mattress within days of purchase still in original packaging , and were refused .
negative	next time , we will spend our money at an establishment that values their customers .
negative	i recieved a very rude and condecending email after i requested a refund .
negative	i am relocating to another state and needed the parts rather quickly so i could not comply with their security protocol .
negative	my shipping address and billing_address are different on my credit_card so i recieved an_email from customer service stating my order was on hold because of it .
negative	seeing as how i am in a hurry to fix my vehicle i did not have the time to switch my addresses on my credit_card .
negative	when i emailed partsgeek about my delima i recieved this condescending email .
negative	i am not a 0 year_old and did not need a lesson on how credit_card transactions work , just a refund .
negative	when we charge a card it pulls an " authorization " that holds the funds until our bank verifies their availability .
negative	the authorization is usually in your pending charges for 0 - 0 business days before it clears and goes into your settled transactions .
negative	we don_'_t actually " see " your money until the bank releases it .
negative	it '_s the same with credits .
negative	once we credit the card it goes through the same authorization process , but in reverse , until your bank verifies that we have the funds available to post to your account .
negative	we don_'_t really " take " your money right_away , we can still void the charge within 00_hours , because it � s not really a charge , it � s an authorization .
negative	depending_on your bank , it � s usually 0 - 0 business days before any transactions are really settled ; such as the $ 0 . 00 charge in pending transactions for up to 0 days for gasoline transactions .
negative	if i could do anything to speed up the process i would .
negative	i did all i can on my end .
negative	i ordered a necklace for my wife almost two_weeks_ago and it is still " in production ".
negative	no where on the site did / does it state that it was too_late to order in time for mother '_s day .
negative	suffice it to say that while i will reserve judgement on the product , the company itself is horrible with cs ( they don_'_t respond to email ) and i won_'_t be ordering from them again !
negative	i purchased from parts_geek because of there prices .
negative	i saw on my credit_card statement that they took the money and i got a order #.
negative	it has_been 0_weeks and still no products .
negative	i even tried_calling and there customer service was a recording saying pretty_much that where to busy to talk to you .
negative	it said to go out and fill_out a form on there website to be called back .
negative	all i want is my money back because i had to purchase from the dealer .
negative	i wouldn_'_t ever recommend using this company .
negative	i have not got my money yet w wakley
negative	customer service is terrible !
negative	you do not feel_like your business or concerns matter .
negative	you sell two brand motor_mount i order the expensive one knowing ill get quality mounts
negative	you send me cheap ones mande in china
negative	i could have order from you anchore mounts at half price
negative	$_00 vs $_00 each
negative	i lost some $_00 dollars you lost a customer
negative	jeg_havde_fået_en trådløs udløser i gave , som_skulle passe til mit kamera .
negative	da_jeg åbner pakken bliver jeg dog hurtigt klar over at den_er fejlpakket , da stikket ikke passer i mit kamera .
negative	i butikken finder de den_rigtige frem til_mig , åbner kassen og tjekker , og_det_er rigtigt nok .
negative	men_så stopper det også .
negative	jeg_kan_ikke få_den byttet uden at vise en kvittering .
negative	fair nok hvis_jeg_ville have haft pengene tilbage , men_da_der_er tale om en reklamation og en gave synes_jeg det_er for dårligt .
negative	da_jeg giver udtryk for min mening på_en venlig måde bliver jeg endda talt nedladende til af flere ekspedienter .
negative	en_anden_gang spurgte jeg ind_til om_de_havde cf - kort , og_der stillede ekspedienten sig bare op som et_stort spørgsmålstegn .
negative	man burde kunne forvente bare et minimum af viden når_det nu_er_en decideret fotobutik .
negative	i hvert_fald ikke et_sted jeg_handler igen ...
negative	i ordered an alternator for my car and on the web_site it would fit my car
negative	same motor year make and model when it came it was wrong so i sent it back
negative	but i had to pay shipping back and a restocking_fee y do i haft to pay a restocking
negative	fee when it was not listed right ?
negative	i will not deal with parts_geek ever again
negative	cjs gave_me a regular skyrim cd - key when i payed for the skryim legendary edition cd - key .
negative	i will never buy another god damned game from them again if this is not fixed in the next 0 - 0 hours .
negative	0 attempts at trying to post a review about a hotel and not able to successfully have any one of them published , was my first_impression with trip_advisor .
negative	the help_desk said that they have software that picks_up certain keywords and this prevents certain reviews from getting published .
negative	but 0 attempts ???
negative	a bed bug problem in a hotel is something i feel the public should know about .
negative	no one should have to go through the experience my family and i went through .
negative	why should the public not be informed of such a significant problem ?
negative	does not make any sense .
negative	if the ta gets paid off by certain businesses from having negative_reviews posted , than this makes more sense as to why none of my reviews have gotten published .
negative	i will never order from these bait and switch artist again - beware read the policies , they do not favor you .
negative	do not order from this company !
negative	i placed my order back in sept 0000 and to this very day have not received merchandise or a refund !
negative	contacted them the first time a few_days after the a delivery date they promised in the confirmation_email .
negative	it is odd how they don_'_t have a customer service phone_number / line and you have to go and " chat " on their website if you have issues .
negative	my first dispute about the merchandise not arriving was counter with telling_me to wait a few more days since there might be some delays .
negative	i agreed .
negative	two_weeks_later nothing came !
negative	contacted them again ... was told .
negative	things are on back order and they will re - order and re - send my items .
negative	i agreed .
negative	so i waited and forgot all about my order .
negative	holiday_season other things on my mind , until i received an_email about snugg offers .
negative	so in december i got online and spoke with a person named hannah who claims to be the customer service manager .
negative	i was thru with snugg and just wanted a refund on my purchase .
negative	she told me she would have to contact the warehouse to see if it was sent out or what happened and then she will process my refund .
negative	this brings me to today !
negative	no refund nothing ....
negative	so i got online again !
negative	talked to another person named shauni who told me she would have to talk to hannah to see what happened .
negative	she also said they will look at it with in 00_hours and i will receive an_email about the status .
negative	what is wrong with this company !
negative	i just want a refund on items i never got !
negative	don_'_t take my money in the first place if you don_'_t have the merchandise to sell !
negative	so now its even harder to get my money back and of course i never got any merchandise !
negative	i '_m located in the usa so i don_'_t know if all the positive review are from the uk , but this company is scamming me right now .
negative	i just want my money back !
negative	will not ever recommend or order from this company again !
negative	i ordered my part for over night shipping .
negative	and i didnt get my part untill three_days_later .
negative	also trying to get_ahold of parts_geek sucks .
negative	i have been a customer since sept 0000 and in jan_0000 i was mailed a letter_stating that my rate would go up $_00 . 00 per_month .
negative	when i called and asked the guy told me i had been with them for a while now and contract states they can raise my rent at anytime with 00days notice .
negative	a long time ?
negative	0 months ?
negative	really ?
negative	they guy was rude and when asked how much noticed i needed to give to move out he said , 0 days ... " i can take the notice right now , do you want to give 0 day notice " he said .
negative	wow .
negative	i guess they don_'_t care about keeping customers .
negative	they know its not easy to just pack up and move so they raise rent when they feel_like it ..
negative	i did not come in on an introductory special for 0 months or a year ,,, i assumed that would be the price for at_least a yr . not very happy with this roseville location and the attitude of the front_desk person .
negative	i would never use parts_geek again , i order a flywheel and clutch_kit assembly and only received the flywheel .
negative	the box that both were sap post to be in was destroyed when i received it .
negative	the box was about 0 - 0 time bigger then it should have been for the two parts that was ordered .
negative	still_waiting on if i ’ ll ever see the other parts i ordered , but as of now i haven ’ t seen the clutch_kit assembly .
negative	i turned this issue over to my credit_card company and they are going to fight for me .
negative	world rugby shop is a sham .
negative	hidden_charges everywhere .
negative	they deliver outside the u . s through an external company who charge much more than you agree for delivery .
negative	also , the import duties for deliveries to addresses outside the u . s are ridiculous .
negative	you think its a bargain but its not .
negative	stay_away !
negative	i order parts 0 parts last_week .
negative	they came in 0 packages .
negative	i received 0 of the 0 packages last_week .
negative	still have not received my missing package .
negative	fedex doesn_'_t know where it is .
negative	parts_geek wont send a new replacement part .
negative	unless i buy a new one .
negative	i didn_'_t lose it so shouldn_'_t have to buy a new one .
negative	once this is all and done , i will not order from partsgeek . com p . s .
negative	still_waiting on my part .
negative	pay_pal is no pal .
negative	the reservation process was fine .
negative	the problem is that they charged me for my stay 00 days before i was to arrive .
negative	the did not tell me that i was going to be charged now and not when i utilize the reservation like normal businesses do , now my credit_card expects me to pay for the reservation before i have even used it .
negative	this is not right .
negative	and your reservation company in the phillipians has only canned answers when you ask questions .
negative	i will never use them again .
negative	and if i have any_problems at the ramada_inn where the reservation is made for i will never use ramada_inn again .
negative	that ´_s really one of the most awful shops i even bought an item .
negative	the wakemate was broken when it arrived in europe so i tried to get in contact with these_guys - no answer .
negative	after two_weeks they answered and told me to send the wakemate back .
negative	on my own expenses !!!
negative	i did it as i wanted my money back .
negative	btw - the quality is so bad of this product !
negative	nevertheless they never replied to my emails asking for refund .
negative	hands off this shop if you do not want to loose your money .
negative	wir_hatten 0 wochen kein anschluss und niemand wußte bescheid bei 0und0 .
negative	anfragen unsererseits wurden beantwortet mit_der standardaussage , dass man an dem problem ` arbeitet `.
negative	wir mußten einen vertrag kündigen und rechnungen bezahlen , wofür 0und0 außer ´ an dem problem zu arbeiten ´ nie gegenleistung erbracht hat .
negative	letztendlich sind wir in einen telekom shop gegangen und nach 0 woche hatten wir unseren anschluss und internet .
negative	alles ohne_probleme !
negative	spart euch den ärger mit 0und0 .
negative	leider kann_ich keine null sterne vergeben - ein stern ist schon maßlos geschönt !
negative	p . s .
negative	das 0und0 werbung mit_einem leiter service macht ist mehr_als lächerlich !
negative	i ordered 0 small items from parts_geek .
negative	because they shipped them from 0 different places , they charged me twice for shipping and handling .
negative	one of the parts they shipped me was the wrong part ( it was labeled correctly on the package , but was the right hand piece instead of the left_hand .)
negative	i notified customer service immediately over a week_ago and all i get are endless e_-_mails that say that they are approving my return and will send me an " rma e_-_mail " with return instructions - an e_-_mail that has yet to arrive .
negative	so , not only did they only get 00_% of my initial order correct ( yes i double_checked my order - the mistake was not mine ), they have so_far failed to correct their error .
negative	i bought an item from cash_generator on the website .... it arrived and the items software had already been used and would not let_me register it .
negative	i contacted the store and they advised the would contact the original seller to try and resolve this ... i never_heard from them again .
negative	in total i sent another 0 emails after this with no response .
negative	i then tested the item on a friends computer who has the software and the item is completely fault !!!!
negative	i have then since sent 0 other emails and have just been ignored ..!
negative	!
negative	have had to open a case on paypal to try and get the money back .
negative	i have bought alot of items from cash_generator in the past .....
negative	this will be my last !
negative	!
negative	i wanted to pick_up an ' ultimate_game card ' to get some ' zen ' for star trek online .
negative	imagine my delight when i saw them on pc_game_supply , not only for instant delivery , but 00_%_off as well !
negative	i input my information to purchase a single card for 00 . 00 us .
negative	the site was quite slow to process ... and when i recieved my reciept , i had been charged for 0 cards for a total of 00 dollars !
negative	i immediately emailed customer service to explain that i had been charged in error , and only wanted one card .
negative	i recieved a rather curt and terse reply , that said " look again , you bought 0 cards ."
negative	that was it .
negative	no offer or willingness to assist , simply a one_sentence reply telling_me that i was wrong and implied it was my fault , so deal with it .
negative	reviewing the site '_s refund policy , i saw that if i had not looked at the codes ( i hadn_'_t ) i could request a refund and would be given one with no trouble .
negative	i wrote back , again indicating that as i had said , i only wanted a single card , and a refund for the second one .
negative	i recieved a reply that my request would be forwarded to management .
negative	the next_day , i recieved another email indicating that my credit_card had only been ' pre_- authorized ' and i had not been charged at all .
negative	this was untrue , according to my bank '_s website .
negative	i then recieved another email_stating that i had been issued a refund for both cards ( despite that not being what i asked for .)
negative	to get clarification to this whole mess , i used their site link to their live_chat support - which doesn_'_t exist , apparently .
negative	i find the customer service number and call .
negative	i was placed on hold ( fairly standard ) and assured it would be a few_minutes at most .
negative	aproximately 0 minute later , my call was kicked to voice_mail .
negative	it said to leave a name and number , which i did along with my account email .
negative	my call , to date , has still not been returned .
negative	to summarize : run , don_'_t walk_away from this company .
negative	no communication , customer rep . will contact you within 00 to 00_hours , never happened at anytime .
negative	done with trying to do_business with these_people .
negative	i thought i would try this as an_alternative but found the chocolates far too sweet and no real flavour of chocolate , more like a thornton '_s or cadbury '_s selection .
negative	i realise that many people prefer this type of chocolate but i prefer chocolates made with high cocoa content from good cocoa beans .
negative	the fillings i found insipid and lacking in flavour .
negative	i do not like the taste of sorbitel as a sweetner and really has no place in chocolate .
negative	these chocolates from cocoa boutique are just not for me .
negative	i buy a lot of stuff online , and was appalled by the packaging of the item by gadget_grotto .
negative	ok - so they ' d wrapped my item in a bit of bubble_wrap .
negative	but it was then packed into a plastic_bag , leaving the gift box i had bought so badly_damaged that i couldn_'_t give it as a gift and had to bin it .
negative	the other product was covered in sellotape - impossible to remove without_damaging the package and opening the item .
negative	again unable to give as a gift .
negative	all in all , a terrible experience and i can_honestly say i '_ll never purchase from them again .
negative	i ordered 0 items but only 0 were delivered .
negative	i '_m hoping parts_geek will help me rectify the situation .
negative	supplementwarehouse does not guarantee lowest shipped price and on the phone , the rep did not care about the false_advertising .
negative	no sense in bothering with this website anymore .
negative	i pre_- ordered an item from shopto . net .
negative	it was supposed to be delivered today ( 00 / 00 / 0000 ) this was the release_date for the order in question .
negative	i eventually contact customer_services to find out there is no driver available to deliver my parcel until monday ( 00 / 000000 ).
negative	what kind of incompetent delivery company doesn_'_t have a driver available to deliver a parcel , when they had all day to do it ?
negative	this is the worst delivery company i have ever_dealt_with .
negative	i wish i now chose tnt from shopto '_s drop down menu .
negative	avoid like the plague , if you want to be disappointed on not getting a pre_- order when you ' re supposed to .
negative	dpd will be getting an official complaint from me as well .
negative	update_: i did receive my order today for launch day .
negative	however , it was at around_0pm .
negative	the anticipation of setting_up the xbox one and trying it has worn off , after waiting all day for the delivery .
negative	this is the first ever time i '_ve received a delivery this late .
negative	shopto should not use this company again in my opinion .
negative	this doesn_'_t change my rating , despite i did receive the parcel eventually .
negative	i still think dpd is a joke of a delivery company , and they had all day to deliver this .
negative	you ' re not telling_me there is only one local delivery driver in the bolton area .
negative	i know my item was sitting in a van for hours on end because the items were at a very cold temperature .
negative	just hope my console is fine .
negative	i have a pre_- order with game and apparently , they use this company as well .
negative	great , another stressful day next friday .
negative	i '_m going to contact game to see if i can change the courier because i '_m not getting another parcel delivered by you again , and i '_m willing to pay extra to use another courier .
negative	screw you .
negative	(- _ -) , l ,,
negative	i am so feed up with pg have no part and having - - - - trying to get my money have contact pg many time only response is e_-_mail i need to speak to a live_person but i guess thats not possible due to the 00th time i have call them and the number of hours i have held the phone waiting on a live_person to pick_up never happen an i mean never happen been 0 - month still no part are money back i dont have time to wait on pg to do any kind of investigation just need my money back 0 - month an counting i have giving this company my contact number to call me no no no response an i mean no response feed feed up with pg as a company when it come to doing bussiness at this time thats_why i rated pg as a 0 - star all i ask was for someone to call me from pg i mean they are open 0 - 00_hours a day and they cant take the time to call me an discuss this issues when i have been a loy an a dang good coustomer not once are twce but many time if this is how you pg treat your loy coustomer then we as coustomer should take our business ( elsewhere ).
negative	i '_ve tried to contact them numerous_times but have been unsuccessful .
negative	i '_ve submitted a ticket to see what has_been going on .
negative	it '_s almost a week since i submitted my first order , so that '_s one more week without my supplies .
negative	this is the last time i '_ll try ordering something from them , if my issue doesn_'_t get resolved by the end of the week , i '_ll look somewhere_else for my supplies because i '_ve never had any order issues with the vitamin_shoppe .
negative	the hotel lobby closed at 00pm .
negative	i had to find more_expensive hotel that night .
negative	i still did not receive my refund email yet from travelocity
negative	my review for your company is not a good one .
negative	there was an error in booking my stay and it took 0 people and 0 days to resolve and not once did i get to speak with anyone_who spoke_english very well !!!!
negative	!
negative	in all fairness i should first state that shame on me for not looking at all the negative_reviews online , shame on me for not looking at the 000 + negative reports on the bbb ( better business_bureau ) website .
negative	now , i purchased a locking fuel cap for my 0000_ford_f000 .
negative	i got a non locking fuel cap for a 0000 land_rover .
negative	of course i could send this back ( at my expense ) and hope i get the right one the next time .
negative	why would i trust them when they sent the wrong one the first time .
negative	they say on their website that if they are wrong you still have to pay for shipping back to them .... convenient .
negative	if you call their number , they never answer .
negative	if you contact their customer_support via their webpage you will get blocked the second time you try and contact them as it will say you have exceeded your maximum amount of contacts ....
negative	well i ended_up spending $_00 for the cap and shipping .
negative	i threw the land_rover fuel cap in the trash and have decided to let that 00 bucks educate me for all future online purchases .
negative	i will no_longer buy anything from any company before doing a thorough check on how they treat their customers .
negative	do your self a favor and run from this company !
negative	we cancelled a prepaid hotel reservation thru a travelocity phone rep , they called the hotel while we were on the phone , confirmed cancellation with us , promised our $_000 refund within 0 - 00 days ...
negative	it '_s been months , we only get robo responses now , no refund ...
negative	not very professional ...
negative	it '_s funny because not only do i use them , but my company travel dept uses them , and we have tens of thousands of employees ...
negative	it only takes one bad egg , if it '_s a big enough egg !
negative	mr . schultz , founder of a little coffee co ...
negative	business without integrity .
negative	i found a better price on an item elsewhere and entered the information into the site to receive a price match , plus 0 %_discount ( as the business loves to advertise ).
negative	lo and behold , my order was cancelled the very next_day for an alleged ' address error '.
negative	i allege that they do not uphold their policy and use it as a marketing ploy .
negative	give it a try yourself and see .
negative	because i am a zone alarm customer this outfit called identity_guard sez , oh your such a loyal_customer , we are going to give you one free year of protection !
negative	then you are shown a page with pricing plans .
negative	well all that valuable free stuff is , to sum it up nicely , one [ 0 ] check mark for all of those valuable free things ... one !
negative	if you really want all the things this company offers , which are awesome things to have ... like the 0 credit bureau monitoring or 00 / 0 customer_support or any other items that come with a paid monthly subscription .
negative	well i can '_t afford any of it !
negative	i feel that i had my pants pulled down in the gym or something all in the name of a " loyal " customer and free things !!
negative	!
negative	good prices , high s / h cost work out to about the same as everyone_else .
negative	my order took more than 00_hours before i had a tracking_number .
negative	i made a similiar order from vitadigest .
negative	the product cost was more but the s / h cost were half .
negative	total worked out to be about the same .
negative	the big_difference , my product from vd took 0 days , sw took 0 .
negative	when i asked sw about it , they gave_me a run around about price_matching .
negative	i didn_'_t ask for a price match , i paid the advertised price .
negative	i think these_guys are probably doing 0rd_party , that '_s why it takes so long to process orders .
negative	if you can wait and you live close , i guess they aren_'_t bad .
negative	well the game was posted to the wrong_address ( my home address ) even know the site says my work address of belfast .
negative	really not happy as i am only off at the weekend and wont get to play the game now for 0 more days :(
negative	have ordered a lace nightgown with french knickers the knickers are a large and wasnt given the choice of size
negative	also have ordered two midi dresses for my wife who is a size ten , again i wasn_'_t given the choice of size
negative	cig looks ok but unfortunatly it leaks out the fluid if on its side so quality very poor .
negative	then it stopped_working only after a week
negative	i was in the mavis_tire location on east ridge rd for 0 hours just to find and repair a leak in my tire .
negative	as a business_owner myself here in new_york , i chose to search for a local_florist in valrico , florida and a google_search brought up ava '_s flowers in the 00000 area .
negative	that ... is misleading advertising for this company is just one more floral operation on the scale of 0000flowers and others ... not an established storefront located in any specific town or city .
negative	in any event , i scrolled through the available mother '_s day offerings , most with " same day delivery " banners on the images which i thought was acceptable , still under the impression that this " business " was in an area not far from my daughter '_s home in florida .
negative	i then found an attractive gift basket that was made up with flowers and fruit , thought it would be fun to order for something different .
negative	i upgraded the arrangement to premium , was charged an_additional_fee for a gift_card and the total order came to $_00 . 00 ( order #_000000 ).
negative	with the " same day delivery " availability , i chose the date of 0 / 0 / 00 .
negative	shortly_after , i was notified from avas_flowers customer_support request # t00000000 , via_e_-_mail , that the order could not be delivered with this message : " unfortunately we are unable to deliver your order for the requested delivery date .
negative	we will deliver the arrangements as soon as possible with an upgrade for the inconvenience .
negative	"; i was puzzled as to how much more this item could be " upgraded " since i had already paid for , and was charged for , a premium upgrade and ... i was extremely annoyed .
negative	as such , i contacted customer service with my concerns .
negative	no response .
negative	the order was delivered to my daughter '_s home , on 0 / 0 / 00 at approximately 0 : 00 p . m .
negative	when she arrived home from her office , a photo was sent of the arrangement .... a generic fruit basket which contained no flowers , as portrayed on ava '_s website .
negative	frankly , i could have ordered a fruit basket from a local publix supermarket in florida had i wanted something so mundane .
negative	i immediately messaged customer_support to register my complete dissatisfaction and request compensation on some level and , to date , have heard_nothing back ... again .
negative	until ... this morning when i just received an e_-_mail from " cbrian @ avasflowers . com " advising me that they have created a personalized feedback page for me to rate my experience but .... when clicking on the link which takes me to my order , a window comes up with a red " x " stating that " this order is not available for feedback "
negative	in short , ava '_s does not want my feedback as it will be anything but positive .
negative	my web research brings up countless negative_reviews from people who have had similar experiences with ava '_s flowers and it '_s horrific customer_support department .
negative	lesson well - learned and a mistake that i will never repeat .
negative	mother '_s day - 0000 has_been completely spoiled for my daughter and i am beyond embarassed that my good itentions in trusting ava '_s flowers amounted to a supermarket - quality basket of fruit ... and nothing more .
negative	buyer_beware !
negative	!
negative	you charged me $ 0 . 00 to send me a gift_card for a restaurant .
negative	it was a gift_card for my grandson .
negative	you didn_'_t even give me the option to make it out in his_name and send it to me .
negative	i should have just wrote him a check and gave it to him on christmas .
negative	i could have given him the $ 0 . 00 i gave you ..
negative	i bought another gift_card on the internet .
negative	there was no charge for the service , they sent me an e_-_mail to print out the gift_card .
negative	i didn_'_t have to wait to get it .. you even tried to talk me out of usps to get more money out of me .
negative	you are a ripoff !!
negative	!
negative	i ordered a hella replacement_headlight for my car .
negative	partsgeek . com shipped a tyc brand headlight for a car other than mine , packaged in a hella box labeled with the correct part number .
negative	partsgeek . com does not accept customer service phone_calls , however they did issue a rma for the item through their online ticket system .
negative	they did not issue a shipping_label , so i '_m left to ship the incorrect item back on my dime , and hope that they refund the original purchase price .
negative	don_'_t waste your time with this outfit .
negative	sweatpants run on short side
negative	there shipping is bad it take_forever to get something
negative	habe am 0 .
negative	aug bestellt .
negative	mehrere e_-_mails bekommen um den status meines bestellung anzugeben ; das letzte war am 00 .
negative	aug dass sagte dass_der sendung in detschland beim zollamt eingegangen ist .
negative	seit dann haben_wir nichts von_der firma gehoert , und kriegen auch kein anwtwort zu_meiner e_-_mails .
negative	i ordered windshield_wipers for my car and they were incorrect .
negative	they weren_'_t the right ones and while the company was kind enough to refund the price of the part i got stuck_paying postage both_ways .
negative	it '_s not fair .
negative	i trusted the company .
negative	i bought their offered product in good faith and i '_m out money for no other reason than trusting that the part they listed as the correct part was the correct part .
negative	it wasn_'_t .
negative	i '_m done dealing_with this company .
negative	fool me once ...
negative	well my friend i have to recieve my product paid for 0n 0 - 00 - 00 , geek sent it out on 0 - 00 - 00 from nashville .
negative	it departed nashville on 0 - 00 - 00 at 0000hrs , arrived in bloomington ca on 0 - 00 - 00 at 0000hrs left bloomington ca on 0 - 00 - 00 at 0000hrs for anaheim ca .
negative	where i live , bear in mind bloomington is 00 miles from anaheim , as of 0 - 00 - 00 i have not recieved it .
negative	wondering_if this is a rip_off will be notifying my bank of the scam
negative	asked for aaa rate !
negative	did not get !
negative	!
negative	i would like a refund for my room at the manguson hotel in elberton , ga for friday , 0 / 00 / 00 .
negative	the hotel is a disgrace and filthy .
negative	i applied for a loan , got accepted , completed the contract and selected faster payments at a huge cost of £_00 extra .
negative	at 00 : 00 i received a text saying that the money had been sent but still nothing has appeared in my account .
negative	i have used a number of payday lenders and every time i have received the funds within 00_mins without a problem .
negative	tried to contact wageme . com at 00 : 00 , as their website says they are open until 00 : 00 , but you get a marketing message about the company and then the phone goes dead .
negative	not impressed .
negative	i could have used another company but as you receive all of the documents through and text confirmation you would assume there was no_issues .
negative	then to have no staff available at 00 : 00 is not a great advertisement of their excellent customer service .
negative	order was placed over a week_ago and per ups tracker , shipped out monday june 0 .
negative	all indication was that it would be delivered in advance of father '_s day .
negative	instead , the shippment was delayed while in transit and did not show up until today , monday june_00th , a full week_later .
negative	the cooler had no ice in it ( or the dry_ice had evaporated ?
negative	), the meat was unfrozen and soggy , and blood was on the bottom of the cooler .
negative	this just happened hours ago when this review option popped_up , so i am drafting this almost in real time .
negative	i have not yet contacted the company to determine next steps as this is unacceptable .
negative	we are hopefully that the situation will be remedied in a reasonable and timely_fashion .
negative	i wanted a hotel in durham nh and it booked me a hotel in durham nc .
negative	i realized it right_away and canceled it .
negative	since i canceled , it '_s been almost 0 days and haven_'_t received my 000 $!!!
negative	!, a phone_call , e_-_mail or anything besides this survey .
negative	i '_ve tried to call them but no one answers and email is always " forbidden " at this time .
negative	so i hope this will get someone '_s attention .
negative	my dog is blind and deaf .
negative	last month i had mailed in 0 rx '_s for his eye medications with 0 refills on all and had a shipment sent .
negative	this month i ordered over the weekend as i new i was in need during the upcoming week of refills .
negative	i paid for overnight shipping $_00 extra .
negative	i get an_email that i dont have refills and my vet will need to be contacted !
negative	i email back how is that possible as i have refills !
negative	i get a response the next_day that he didn_'_t look " far enough back " in the file to see that i did have refills .
negative	unprofessional and uncaring after i fully explained everything .
negative	except now he says they don_'_t have 0mg in stock and since the refill is written for 0mg he can '_t send 00mg and charge me more - he says he has to contact my vet to authorize 00mg !
negative	another day lost !
negative	and on top of everything my order gets sent out usps regular mail !
negative	received 0 days_later .
negative	terrible customer service !
negative	seriously_considering going to 0000petmeds starting with my next refill .
negative	jesse spalma
negative	i would not use this chemist again .
negative	the order hasn_'_t arrived and they have not responded to my request for assistance .
negative	i even tried phoning the 0000 number to be told by a recorded announcement there were no staff available to deal with my call .
negative	this was perhaps the worst customer service experience i have ever had in my life .
negative	my order was never deliverer .
negative	it was scheduled to be delivered late .
negative	the steaks were a father '_s day gift .
negative	your staff refunded my money after an_hour of trying to explain to me why it was my fault .
negative	the ordering system that you have leaves a lot to be desired .
negative	i placed my order on a wednesday for a saturday delivery .
negative	if it wasn_'_t possible , it should not have been a delivery date option .
negative	this is not difficult software to fix .
negative	i will never order from chicago_steak again .
negative	it is beyond the lowest levels of customer service to literally tell me that it was my fault i should have read the fine_print of the shipping section more carefully .
negative	i was really hoping for a better experience .
negative	sad
negative	ordered a y - pipe converter and one of the doughnut gaskets was missing .
negative	service response was , " gaskets are not included ."
negative	no_explanation of the two gaskets that were .
negative	last suggestion was to return the entire shipment .
negative	will not use partsgeek again .
negative	du mal a les contacter par mail et ne réponde jamais et_j_ai dut reussir a trouver le numero de telephone pour arriver a avoir quelqu un pour mes renseignement
negative	i double_checked the year , make and model of my car before purchasing the oil_filter .
negative	today , i changed my oil and went to install the new filter and it was the wrong one !!!!
negative	thank_god i have an extra car to drive to work tomorrow but what happens to those that don_'_t have an extra car to go to work ?
negative	they ' re out a days work because this lousy company says it '_s the correct oil_filter and it " s not !
negative	very bad service dont recomend this service
negative	so i had a coupon that would save me 0 %.
negative	all was good , but i had inadvertently misspelled my name on reservation .
negative	there system said to cancel out the reservation and make a new one .
negative	now the coupon won_'_t work again .
negative	even called there customer service .
negative	i got transferred 0 times and not one was willing or able to help sort it out .
negative	0 of the agents had very poor_english skills .
negative	never again , good bye travelocity !!
negative	!
negative	after dealing_with this dealer ship i realize & know now that you " must " have a layer present ( with you ) just to buy a car !
negative	you ask " y "?
negative	well here '_s what happen to me .
negative	i went to public motors to buy a car , a lexis that they claim was still avaible .
negative	when i arrive they told me they sold it , but they have another car ( 0000 bmw000i ) i told them i can '_t afford it my budget is $_00 , 000 top .
negative	after
negative	tax , financing & other fees it would be well over $_00 , 000 .
negative	so i '_ll walk ...
negative	but " no " they stop me a assure me everything included will not go over $_00 , 000 ( long_story ) after 00mo .
negative	of car payments i car the finance dept .
negative	just to check hom much more $ i thought i was going to here maybe like ... $ 0 , 000 or less , bug instead i got the worst news ....
negative	they said i owe $ 0 , 000 .
negative	i ask how '_s that i put a $ 0 , 000 down plus 00mo .
negative	of payments .... wtf , 00_% apr .
negative	plus some other items in my vary long contract i didn_'_t notice , basically i got trick / had / bamboozle / scame .
negative	btw i purchased there full bumper to bumper warranty .
negative	i had a driver seat & transmission issiue took the car in
negative	for repair & got charge $_000 . 00 when my warranty cover , but they claim it didn_'_t cover some small cable device ... wtf , again !
negative	it would be nice if you would answer my e_mail or picked the phone up ,
negative	waste if time .
negative	parcel now late .
negative	scam alert !!!
negative	be very careful when booking through this website .
negative	i will never use them again .
negative	i received an_email_confirming a reservation only to get to the airport to find out the reservation was cancelled .
negative	i ended_up paying full fare .
negative	i called flighthub '_s " customer service " department only to be told that they sent me an_email that the confirmation was cancelled due to a problem with the credit_card .
negative	my credit_card was charged but the charge was reversed the day before my flight without me knowing .
negative	the response and reason for my problem is that i didn_'_t read the contract .
negative	the supervisor put the blame on me for not reading thing contract .
negative	i asked_him who reads an entire contract and he tells_me that he does and everyone should .
negative	so , be very careful if you buy a ticket from this site .
negative	this company is a scam !!
negative	horrible service !!!
negative	!
negative	it started when parts_geek shipped my order from different_locations and charged me shipping from each location .
negative	in addition the order was incomplete and rather_than shipping the missing items they gave_me a refund for them ( still got charged for the shipping .
negative	when i tried to contact them to correct it they sent me an_rma to return the part that i never got .
negative	i had to go back and forth via their email portal and they never got it right .
negative	where is their service run out of a foreign_country where they do not understand english ?
negative	i can tolerate an error in order fulfillment but the lack of service , lost time , and added cost is unacceptable .
negative	my ac in my car broke so i needed to get a replacement blower_motor resistor .
negative	i looked online and found the part at a very good price at partsgeek . com .
negative	it was so good that i even paid_extra money to get 0 - 0 express delivery .
negative	well i guess you get what you pay for .
negative	not only did i waste my money paying for rush delivery , because the package took 0 days to arrive , but i also received the completely incorrect part .
negative	mistakes_happen , i guess .
negative	i contacted the service department to fix the problem .
negative	an_automated email informed me that a customer service representative would be contacting me within 00 - 00_hours .
negative	two_days_later i received an_email_saying that the warehouse was contacted and my case was being investigated .
negative	that was almost two_weeks_ago .
negative	this company seems to be irresponsible about accurate business , and it doesn_'_t seem to care about the customer .
negative	i would not recommend partsgeek to anyone in the future , and i am considering going on facebook and spreading my story .
negative	i stated that i needed the drivers_side ... only to recieve the wrong side ... and they couldnt even offer to send me the right part while i was shipping the wrong one back ...
negative	they complete your order , give you an order #, and then turn_around and tell you they cancel it due to " incorrect payment information ".
negative	i verified my info with my bank three_times to which all my info was correct .
negative	my father also go rejected for incorrect info when his info was also correct .
negative	on top of that , they still take your funds on this so called " cancelled " order and have your bank hold the money for 0 - 0 business days !
negative	seriously ??
negative	you complete my order , cancel it , and still put a hold on my money ??
negative	your customer service was no help " there isn_'_t anything we can do ".
negative	my bank was more helpful that you all and i won_'_t be using this site again .
negative	i have stopped others from using you and your reviews are fake .
negative	good riddens !
negative	!
negative	item not delivered , no note from the company and no details on which company delivered it .
negative	customer_services just gave_me another 0000 number to call .
negative	i made a mistake ordering from them and immediately ( within a few_minutes of purchasing ) asked to cancel my order and get a refund , and they refused .
negative	i sent an_email to you on the 00 / 00 but did not get a reply .
negative	our internet_connection has_been down for 00_hours today .
negative	they should have told me that the router would need to be reconfigured once the switch was processed .
negative	i am extremely angry as it has cost me £ 0000 '_s in lost productivity , not to mention stress .
negative	i am disgusted with xln and the service i get , time after time .
negative	we booked a self_storage_unit online .
negative	the day we were supposed to get the key , we showed_up during the opening hours , 00 : 00 when it is supposed to close at 00 : 00 .
negative	we waited for more than 00 mn , no one came .
negative	we called the phone_number provided on the reservation slip .
negative	no one picked_up the phone .
negative	unacceptable .
negative	i '_m glad we didn_'_t show up with a full truck but only with a small car .
negative	if you can find something else , go for something else , it can '_t be worst ..
negative	these refills would not fit my hp office jet 0000 printer .
negative	the ink leaked out as soon as i opened the cartage .
negative	these are poor quality refills .
negative	it '_s $_00 cheaper_than 000 capsules of nespresso .
negative	you get what you pay for .
negative	i '_m going back to nespresso since i enjoy a great cup of espresso in the morning .
negative	unfortunately i '_ve wasted $_00 and now i '_m stuck with 00 more of these capsules .
negative	order was cancelled without explanation after receiving confirmation that it was placed .
negative	the notification was ambiguous ... only said that my credit_card was credited .
negative	i hope it was actually cancelled because i ordered the parts elsewhere and received them in 0 days !
negative	i was unable to call them during their limited hours of operation due to my work obligations .
negative	bought on 00th_dec .
negative	wasn_'_t given an option to change delivery address when making purchase online , so emailed to ask for it to be changed .
negative	i asked for this before it was sent out .
negative	response = " we are too_busy after christmas to change it , contact uk mail "
negative	so i rang up and asked .
negative	the guy said he would change it , but as i later found out - it didn_'_t happen .
negative	so i changed delivery address with uk mail .
negative	uk mail then proceeded to entirely lose the package ( and they are a pithy , small minded courier if there ever was one ).
negative	after six or seven daily calls to ukmail and being given the runaround - ie receiving txts that it would be delivered , setting my alarm while on holiday so i didn_'_t miss the delivery , then at the end of each day ( this happened three_days running ) ringing them to be told it '_s in a depot somewhere and would be sent ' soon ' or ' tomorrow '.
negative	[_name ] in the customer centre was the biggest culprit here - that guy needs training .
negative	they eventually admitted that they had lost it and i had to contact merlin to make a claim .
negative	i contacted merlin and asked if they could resend my order .
negative	it had been a week by now , the order was paid for but i hadnt received my goods .
negative	i was told i ' d have to wait for the outcome of ukmails investigation .
negative	oh right , which bit of that was my fault then ?
negative	once again - an opportunity to put it right was royally screwed_up .
negative	in all fairness - [_name ] dealt_with it well the first time and did call me back .
negative	after that it took three calls to speak to him , ( no one else could deal with it apparently ) being promised a call back each time and not getting one .
negative	it then turned_out i had been sent the last set of rollers , so they were on back order .
negative	when ?
negative	" one to two_weeks " so is it one or two_weeks ?
negative	" we can '_t say "
negative	i had been messed about so much i cancelled the order , was told it would be refunded to paypal the next_day .
negative	at 0 : 00 the next_day it still wasn_'_t refunded and i realised that you had the best price and i ' d rather use you than [_external reference_] because you are a bike shop , i reinstated the order .
negative	first thing i should say is that i very rarely drop anyone in it over service .
negative	things_happen .
negative	we could put this level of service down to being incredibly busy after christmas ( you certainly told me that enough times ), but as your customer why should i care that you are busy ?
negative	i bought something weeks_ago that still_hasnt arrived .
negative	in summary , not one part of this delivery has_gone well .
negative	i have been the one chasing it or nothing would have happened .
negative	i will seriously_consider in future whether the best price and using a dedicated bike store is worth the ton of hassle and the weeks of lost base miles .
negative	sort it out .
negative	a couple of phone_calls from you and appearing to give a monkeys would have made this complaint unnecessary
negative	it took over 0 hours and 00_minutes to book 0 motels pages would not load !
negative	i needed to modify one booking and was told i had to call book it modify .
negative	while i was on hold for excess of 00_minutes and no one answered i was continually told that i could modify on line .
negative	then a recording came through telling_me that i would be charged $_00 for modifying my reservation .
negative	worst website i have dealt_with in a long time !!!!
negative	would not recommend it to anyone !!!!!
negative	!
negative	i made a reservation thinking i was calling the sheraton .
negative	i specifically_asked about their cancellation_policy .
negative	i was told they do not charge a cancellation_fee but if the hotel charges a cancellation_fee they would " pass it on ".
negative	i booked a date that was 0 months away and cancelled 00_minutes later .
negative	my card was charged $_000 as a cancellation_fee / penalty .
negative	i contacted the sheraton hotel .
negative	they told me they would not charge a cancellation_fee under these circumstances .
negative	i contacted the crooks hotelreservations . com and was told they would reverse the charges .
negative	they lied again .
negative	nothing was reversed .
negative	i filed a dispute claim with the credit_card company .
negative	the hotelreservations . com lied to the credit_card company , telling them that i was told of their cancellation_policy .
negative	so these_people are crooks , liars and ripoff scam_artists .
negative	i thought i was calling the hotel direct and instead must have gone_thru and independent
negative	agent which charged my card immediately two_weeks before my stay and charged my $_000 . 00 for a room that would have cost me $_00 . 00 direct !!!!!!!
negative	!
negative	i needed a hose shipped to new mexico where my son broke_down in my land_rover .
negative	i ordered the part and provided the shipping instructions .
negative	because i needed it shipped to a different address you canceled my order for visa verification .
negative	i had no way to call and speak to a representative so i had to order from another auto store .
negative	the problem was i lost 0 days with my son broken down in a strange city .
negative	thanks for your terrable service .
negative	i ordered the part .
negative	tried to install it .
negative	it did not fit the same as the oem part i removed .
negative	tied to return it .... forget calling the phone_number , you '_ll grow old on hold .
negative	they must know they suck , look at all the restrictive language .
negative	be aware that they charge a whooping £ 0000 as a minimum deposit for the cheapest car they have and the deposit goes higher as the car category goes .
negative	seen that most of uk credit providers only give you £ 0000 credit limit on your credit_card as default you might have trouble when collecting the car and having your trip ruined by this non sense deposit .
negative	i '_ve regretted using their services and shall not use again and wouldn_'_t recommend as well .
negative	the part they sent wasnt even close to the one that came out of the car , it was like they sent the wrong part on purpose then made it as hard as they could to return hoping that i would give up thinking that a $_00 part wasnt worth the hastle
negative	i will nevere use partsgeek again !!!!
negative	!
negative	seberal .
negative	places you claim " in stock for i mmediate shipping " within 0 days in fine_print .
negative	ended_up not having at all .
negative	i dod get it elsewhwere
negative	placed order online but despite various attempts neither my wife or my nectar card was aacepted .
negative	homebase were too_busy to check why their site was not working correctly , and i should call nectar who confirmed both cards were working .. called home base who initially refused to add points retrospectively , until i refused to accept this .
negative	they have now promised to do so ..
negative	i will be checking !
negative	!
negative	chatted with tech_support about intermittent dropouts , noting that my regular phone is voip ( time warner ) that does not have this symptom .
negative	he steered_me to a speed test that served a java app that would not run on either internet_explorer or chrome .
negative	i could not find a way to enable it to run .
negative	my next chat attempt with support was taking forever , and i gave up after 00_minutes and was still sixth in line .
negative	i no_longer use phone_power .
negative	a conversation in the pub last_week , " hey mark , i have this great new track i just made in my studio , its an mp0 file on my phone i '_ll send it to you via bluetooth ............... oh wait you have an iphone .....................
negative	great products but a little limited is an_understatement !
negative	say no more
negative	i '_ve been trying to get my glasses for months , was charged and then have been getting biweekly emails_telling_me they are on back order .
negative	i had to cancel the order after .
negative	extremely dissapointed .
negative	first time i ever used priceline and when i made resevations i was going to san_jose some how it got switch to san_francisco .
negative	i called them right back with in the hour to let them know of the mistake and they said to bad .
negative	no one would help .
negative	robert employee no .
negative	000000 would not help in any way .
negative	no customer service what so ever .
negative	my new life mission is to tell all how they suck !!!!!
negative	!
negative	your email crap don_'_t work i tried to find the phone_number and talk to a person found a number but no answer you need to have some kind of person communications other than email
negative	i order parts well over a week_ago and i paid for fed_ex shipping .
negative	now all of a sudden they decide to transfer service and ship through the post_office .
negative	i still do not have my car parts and i would never order from them again .
negative	customer service is rude and puke up info that you could get off the website .
negative	never again
negative	lack of anonymosity and poor screening of posters , eg employees posting for an employer to boost business .
negative	i would never take out a title loan again .
negative	i feel this is what is referred to as a " predatory " business .
negative	you take out a loan and can get caught in a neverending cycle of debt .
negative	i was stupid to do it but that doesn_'_t make taking_advantage of that ok .
negative	also , one of the clerks tried to change my automatic withdrawal date against my wishes .
negative	this had potential for serious consequences to me and i asked her verbally not to change it nicely but she did it anyway .
negative	after i spoke to mgt someone changed it back .
negative	it was unnecessary stress and drama since i never had any_problems with payments or fund availability .
negative	i would never recommend a title loan to anyone .
negative	i don_'_t know how you sleep at night .
negative	i booked a las_vegas mystery_hotel package on book it . com after booking the package and my credit_card being charged i went to print the voucher and received an error_message stating only the airfare portion of the package was reserved , not the hotel .
negative	the error_message told me to call the book it representative to find out what happened .
negative	i called book it and waited 00_minutes to speak with a human_being .
negative	she was unable to help me .
negative	i asked to speak with a supervisor and was placed on hold for another 00_minutes when their computer disconnected the call .
negative	do not use this website if you expect good customer service .
negative	they are unable to provide good customer service !
negative	what have i gained in using interparcel
negative	through interparcel i arranged a pickup through city_link a parcel for pick_up on friday for delivery on saturday which was very important as come tues i '_m away for two_weeks i arrive home on friday_night after work my only chance to check on the parcels progress through the tracking link to find a problem that the parcel has not been collected at 00 . 00 as unsuitable for transit .
negative	other than the tracking note i now know nothing i have recieved no email or phone_call of what is happening from interparcel on looking at contacting interparcel i find that they are shut and phone lines are only mon to friday till 0 . 00 ( carn '_t believe that ) so now leaves me trying to get hold of city_link to try and cancel things i might aswell just gone to them in the first place .
negative	just dont_know what service your offering if anything if anythink you have become the problem in what should of been something very simple
negative	( just read trough some of the reviews looks_like anyone that has had a problem gets the satisfaction of knowing interparcel goes to the effort of pressing a botton and you get a generic reply ) i finish my review as i started why use interparcel
negative	the part 00000 was too_long and when i flexed it to snap the upper piece into place it bowed the plastic where the lock mechanism is at and it popped out .
negative	i will package these back up and return them for a refund .
negative	no support on weekends at all .
negative	the customer is mean nothing to them .
negative	could easely not get your ticket !
negative	booked within 00_hrs of departure and could not get a flight so tried to cancel an_hour after booking and got no response until next_day saying they still had to charge me for one full day plus taxes regardless if i had cancelled within hours of booking it .
negative	stay_away from this service
negative	orderd a fender when it arrived it came in huge 0ft box and the fender is only 0 feet and 0lbs try to get in contact with parts_geek and there is no way of getting thru not happy with the service and the abuse of the delivery
negative	on may 0 , 0000 .
negative	my wife and i were scheduled to fly from toronto to london flight ba - 00 at 0 :_00pm with a connecting_flight to deseldorf flight ba - 000 0 :_00am .
negative	we were excited for our trip and had no_idea was ahead of us .
negative	no words can explain our frustration and disappointment and anger in british_airways .
negative	this is how it started …
negative	we arrived at the airport in toronto may 0st 0000 0 :_00pm a few hours earlier like you are supposed to when traveling international flights .
negative	when we checked in we found out our flight was delayed for 0 hours .
negative	at 00 :_00pm we_boarded the plane and after about 0 hour of waiting to take off and an announcement came on saying , “ sorry for the delay we are having problems closing the cargo doors .” so we continued the long wait for them to fix this problem .
negative	one hour later at 0 :_00am after hours of sitting waiting on the plane , no food , people freaking out , another announcement came on .
negative	“ we have some good news and some bad_news .
negative	the good news is we closed the cargo doors and the bad_news is we have to cancel the flight because the captain has to get 0 hours of sleep before he can fly again .” so now it ’_s 0 :_00am we had to get off the plane , go through customs again , get our languages again , and to “ compensate ” they gave_us a $_00 food voucher , ( meanwhile everything was closed so we could eat any how ), and booked us in a hotel 00 min away .
negative	around 0 :_00am they finally got us on a bus to bring us to the hotel were we had to sat on the phone until 0 :_00am trying to rebook our own flight .
negative	finally we rebooked the flights for the next_day and barely got any sleep .
negative	exhausted and upset we set_up for another day of more frustrations … the bus picked us up at 00 :_00pm to take us to back to the airport .
negative	our new flight scheduled for may 0nd 0000 at 0 :_00pm flight ba - 0000 .
negative	once again it the flight was delayed another 0 hours .
negative	they “ compensated ” us with another $_00 food voucher .
negative	wow !
negative	at 0 :_00pm we once again boarded the plane and to our surprise the flight was delayed another 0 hours due to the cargo doors not being_able to close again !
negative	unbelievable !!!!!.
negative	we finally ended_up taking off 00 :_00pm and arrived in london may 0rd 0000 at 00 :_00am .
negative	thank_god we caught the connecting_flight to dusseldorf a day later very tired and extremely disappointed in british_airways .
negative	my sister drove 0 / 00_hours from olpe germany only to find our flights going to arrive the next_day she had to drive back the next_day to pick as up .
negative	simply unexceptable !
negative	now for the return flight home … as if this ordeal wasn ’ t enough it just continued on our way back home .
negative	we were scheduled to leave on may 00 , 0000 flight ba - 000 leaving from london to toronto at 0 :_00pm .
negative	however more and more delays happened .
negative	two hours_later we_boarded the plane for another two - hour delay sitting waiting on the plane due to the cargo doors not closing again .
negative	they made another announcement the flight was being canceled again !!!!
negative	at this point we didn_’ t know whether to laugh or cry at this disaster of a trip .
negative	they made us leave the plane and walk through a tunnel from terminal 0 to terminal 0 to avoid going through customs .
negative	it took us ½ an_hour to walk there and my poor wife was in high heels .
negative	we finally got to terminal 0 and had to wait for 0 to 0 hours before we_boarded the new plane .
negative	we sat in this plane for another 0 hours and the plane started to move .
negative	just before the runway it stopped for about ½ an_hour and then another announcement came on .
negative	“ sorry for the inconvenience but the flight has_been canceled because of mechanical problems ” seriously ???????
negative	we had to get of the plane go through customs pick our laguges again get on a shuttle_bus after waiting an_hour to board the bus .
negative	they gave_us hotel vouchers eventually .
negative	very unorganized !
negative	once again we had to stay overnight loosing another day .
negative	i cannot express how upset , frustrated , tired and simply disappointed we were in british_airways .
negative	not once , twice , three_times but four times we had to go through this .
negative	we lost 0 full days were completely exhausted and never want to fly british_airways again !!!!
negative	!
negative	to top it off and show the lack of customer service no compensation was offered after this disasters trip .
negative	they should have given us something it ’_s simply unacceptable !
negative	in all my life traveling i have never had a worse experience then this one .
negative	very slow for part return !!
negative	partsgeek . com gave_me the run around for a part return .
negative	they do not answer their phones either .
negative	i ordered exhaust for my truck and they didnt inform_me it was for the half yr after mine and when i got it and reliezed the problem i couldnt talk to a actual person it was all by email and they wouldnt even help me with my problem all they said was that they didnt carry the product i wanted and didnt ask me about shipping it back and so i decided to make it work myself which i shouldnt have to i would give them no stars if i could
negative	sent me a driver_side axle that is damaged .
negative	they said they wont take back items that are installed or used .
negative	i purchased a wheel for my 0000_kia koup .
negative	i ordered the part based on the picture and part number on parts_geek '_s web_site .
negative	they shipped me the wrong wheel with the correct part #.
negative	there is no live customer_support all customer_support is done via_email .
negative	no one answers the 000 # so don_'_t waste your time calling .
negative	to top it off it took over 0_weeks to finally get a refund and they billed me for shipping the original item even_though i never received the correct item .
negative	best advice stay_away from parts_geek
negative	shipped grill for truck in a huge box , way too big for the part ordered , and didn_'_t put and packing_material inside whatsoever , no peanuts , cardboard spacers , nothing .
negative	when i opened it up it was broken .
negative	this is ridiculous and idiotic on their part to not pack an item properly .
negative	would not advise buying from parts_geek .
negative	i booked a hotel for mid march ... stated in agreement i could cancel by february 00 .... cancelled with 00_hours ... on hold 0 times totaling 00_minutes ... couldn_'_t find my itinerary ..... then after all said and done .... charged my credit_card the full_amount .... good service if there no_problems ... but need some customer service and forget it .... side_note .... the people ya deal with speak very rudimentary english so huge communication gap on top of incompetence ..
negative	order the wrong part and immediately realized it and tried to change the order .
negative	i called and emailed , no answer and no email response .
negative	so they send me the wrong part and now i had to pay 00 bucks to send it back and a 00_% restocking_fee .
negative	by the time i get my a /_c compressor , it '_ll be winter .
negative	parts_geek sucks
negative	asking me my opinion and stool haven_'_t got my order ... well , your jumping the gun .. get my order to me then i may have a better opinion
negative	i have ordered 0 mirrors for my car but only received 0 .
negative	i have tried_contacting them but couldn_'_t get a hold of anyone ...
negative	i have sent customer service and it '_s been couple of days and no phone_call back !
negative	i wonder_if someone will call back by monday ...
negative	i ordered 0 parts .
negative	only received 0 .
negative	had to re - order the 0th again and pay extra shipping .
negative	tried_calling and emailing with no returned calls and the emails were shady at best .
negative	never received a refund for the part i never received .
negative	don_'_t think i will be using them again .
negative	get some customer service reps that answer the phone and return calls .
negative	you charge for the card and shipping on each order .
negative	where is the savings ?
negative	0 % is ate up in charges .
negative	i '_m very disappointed , why can '_t we pay the charges once then recharge our cards for a smaller fee .
negative	that would in courage the use of these .
negative	great idea but over charge .
negative	we are in lyoness where we make money by shopping .
negative	no saving here

negative	despite multiple_attempts from the first day my order was never gotten correct , resulting in my cancelation of service .
negative	despite my cancelation of service mistakes continue to be made by at & t .
negative	despite at_least 0 attempts , at & t could not correct their mistake .
negative	stay_away .
negative	use travelocity to see what '_s out there , then book directly with the hotel .
negative	i was double charged by a hotel which i booked through travelocity .
negative	travelocity has the attitude that it is between you and the hotel , even if you booked it through them .
negative	they don_'_t seem concerned that their customers may be cheated by a hotel on a continuing bases .
negative	their " customer service " is in another part of the world .
negative	they have difficulty_understanding you and you have difficulty_understanding them .
negative	i don_'_t know how many_times i had to explain to them that i was charged when i booked ( according to my credit_card statement ) then charged again when i checked out .
negative	they will never call you back to see if the problem was resolved because they don_'_t care !
negative	they wan '_t you to call them and then you have to repeat everything again .
negative	a good company will follow the problem until it is resolved .
negative	i ended_up resolving this with little help from them .
negative	stay_away !!!!!
negative	!
negative	so when i first called phonepower , i explained my situation exactly : i have both at & t internet ( dsl ) and phone line , and i wanted to change both .
negative	phonepower sales , told me to first change the dsl service , then call them to connect the phone .
negative	so i did so ; i cut out " the man !"
negative	only to find :
negative	the dsl provider ( dsl extreme ) worked_perfectly on at & t line , but when i changed to phonepower , it cut the signal .
negative	why ??
negative	because phonepower does not have / provide a dial_tone ( at_least in my area ) so the dsl service cannot be connected !
negative	!
negative	they never even mentioned that at phonepower !
negative	too anxious to get a sale !!
negative	so then i went a month with phone service or dsl , because everything had to be changed back , and there was confusion as to " what company has the rights to the line !"
negative	one month later ; i '_m back with " the man " for the phone line , and dsl extreme , for internet , and i kicked " the little guy " ( phonepower ) right out the house !
negative	too good to be true !
negative	!
negative	parts_geek shipped me someone_else '_s return part which was packaged inproperly and was the wrong part entirely .
negative	they have not responded to my requests for resolution .
negative	i bought a header_panel for my jeep through partsgeek and the shipping was 00 dollars and it took a week and a half to get to me and i bought parts from another company and they used ground_shipping as well and i got my parts in three business days and they were both shipped from the same distance away from me .
negative	so i will never us partsgeek again simply because they charge a ton for shipping and it takes a long time to get to you the only good thing is the price of their products .
negative	i paid for the " pre_- order " option because their website said my cell_phone / provider was " coming soon ".
negative	i needed the unlock for a vacation 0 months later , so i thought there was definitely enough time .
negative	after 0_weeks of no updates , i started emailing them every week .
negative	they kept saying it would happen asap ... well , it took more than 0 months !
negative	so i waited 0 months for an unlock and when it finally became_available , it was 000_pounds !
negative	that '_s $_000 for just an unlock .
negative	they even stated in their email that it was " incredibly expensive ", so i requested a refund for my pre_- order deposit .
negative	i emailed them 0 times and they wouldn_'_t refund me ...
negative	so i wasted $_00 on a product i never received .
negative	stay_away from this company if you have to pre_- order .
negative	if they can do an instant unlock and the price isn_'_t too high , go for it .
negative	they seem legit , but their " pre_- order " policy is a big scam .
negative	they used to be good do not know what happened to
negative	them
negative	here is the issue in a nutshell
negative	my flight was cancelled .
negative	i received an_email from carrier on wed afternoon informing_me my thursday_morning flight was cancelled .
negative	i went to airport and booked a room at airport hotel so i could get out .
negative	at 0 : 00 am i got a call from travelocity informing_me my flight was cancelled .
negative	the woman spoke very little english and told me that my flight was cancelled .
negative	i alrady knew that and asked her what new flights i had been rebooked on .
negative	she was lost .
negative	it was as i was speaking yet another different language other than english .
negative	she was confused .
negative	she told me she had nothing else for me .
negative	i asked to speak with a supervisor and was put on hold .
negative	eventually i hung_up .
negative	i applaud your efforts to inform_me of problems but how come carrier contacted me before 0 pm on wed and you at 0 : 00 am on thursday ?
negative	why such a delay ?
negative	why such a stupid time to call ?
negative	why call and not have any options ?
negative	this is poor customer service .
negative	please repatriate call_center .
negative	the inability to effectively communicate is ridiculous .
negative	calling that time is stupid .
negative	i ordered 0 items , which were showing as in stock ready for immediate_dispatch .
negative	days after the items should have been sent i got an_email to say that they were suffering from a delay from their suppliers !
negative	i thought this odd as the items i had ordered had been in stcok , ( and were still showing as in stock )!
negative	i contacted g0m and was told that the so - called ' in stock ' figures on their website are not accurate , ( one wonders what the point of them is .... except to mislead buyers into mistakenly thinking they will get their order quickly - which is unprofessional and i wonder what trading_standards would say about the practice ).
negative	they told me that they did not have stock of my 0 items so had ordered them from their supplier , who was subject to delays !
negative	classic : blame the supplier !
negative	to my mind it is gear0music who are responsible for misleading me into thinking my items would be dispatched quickly through fictional stock figures !
negative	if i had known that the dispatch of my order would be over three_weeks_later than i expected i wouldn_'_t have even placed an order with them !
negative	their problem is ....
negative	if they were honest and listed out of stock on their website people would spend their money elsewhere , which is exactly_what i will do in future !
negative	their stock figures are pure fiction !
negative	don_'_t waste your money or time being let_down by gear0music - shop elsewhere !!!!
negative	!
negative	i cannot recommend isupplyenergy at all .
negative	in fact i would advise anyone expecting fairness , clarity , professionalism , efficiency and honesty to avoid this company at all costs !
negative	are they cheap ; yes !
negative	does this come at a price ; yes !
negative	the reason they are coming out as the cheapest in a lot of electricity comparisons is that they invest nothing in customer service , next to nothing in energy use / cost prediction software engines and very little in it systems !
negative	if you were lucky_enough to have no_problems , queries or issues , and if you are happy that should you be unfortunate and have any_issues , queries or problems you won_'_t be able to contact anyone or get any help ; and if you don_'_t mind_paying way too much in advance for your electricity and having your direct dibits increase for no reason , then isupplyenergy are the company for you !
negative	good luck !!
negative	!
negative	my experiences of isupplyenergy have not been so fortunate !
negative	despite having plenty of usage history , no change in my usage pattern and my account being in credit they hit me with a huge 00_% increase in my monthly direct_debit !
negative	trying to contact them is a nightmare !
negative	they are almost_impossible to contact on the phone and usually you just get a recorded_message_telling you to use the messaging facility on their website .
negative	when you do what they recommend and send them messages via my account on their website they frequently just completely ignore the messages !
negative	if you ' re lucky_enough to get a response it will take a week or more !
negative	it is most_likely that any reply you do get will have either ignored , misread or misunderstood the content of your original message !
negative	there is no facility to respond to their reply to your message , ( if you ' re lucky_enough to get one ), so you have to create a brand_new message again , and go though the same process , ( ie will they just ignore it etc ).
negative	the chances are that someone different will look at it and you '_ll get a different , though similarly unhelpful response !
negative	( although most people are used to email / texts etc being conveniently grouped in threads or conversations for continuity and easy access this concept is not one isupplyenergy are familiar with )!
negative	communicating with isupplyenergy is the most frustrating experience i have had with any company , ever !
negative	completing the online complaints form on their website does not get any better results than the normal messaging facility !
negative	also , the complaints form often fails to be submitted at the last stage , telling you to log in to your account even_though you already have !
negative	when it does this it wipes everything you have just typed meaning you have to start again !
negative	i assume that a lot of people will be so frustrated by this point that they will just give up meaning less complaints for isupplyenergy to deal with , ( or ignore as they often do )!
negative	i had a fault on my meter and getting them to actually do anything about it involved a lot of time , effort , phone bill and sheer frustration !
negative	when they finally did get an engineer to replace the meter they stopped validating any meter readings on my account and it took massive effort to get them to do anything !
negative	they blame everyone_else but themselves and are completely indifferent to your problems !
negative	they are pig headed , ignorant and simply incabable of getting things right !
negative	they don_'_t care about your issues and demonstrate it admirably .
negative	they altered genuine meter readings in their favour , ( of course ), and then refused to accept the facts until threatened with the police being called in to investigate serious & organised fraud !
negative	they would not accept genuine readings submitted online , despite verification from their own subcontracted meter_reading agency , an independent engineers report & photographic_evidence !
negative	eventually , after much persistence , time effort and more frustration , ( expect this by the shedload if you sign_up with isupplyenergy and have any_queries , issues , faults or problems ), they finally admitted that the readings i supplied were correct , ( though of course they blamed another company )!
negative	however , they still overcharged me !
negative	their sums are so obviously wrong and they are incapable of doing even basic maths !
negative	even a five year_old could see that the calculations worked out by isupplyenergy are blatantly wrong , but isupplyenergy aren_'_t intelligent enough to see the simple error they have made ; i assume that gcse maths is not a requirement of their staff !
negative	i wish i have read_reviews of this company before i signed_up with them !
negative	i have been with 0 of the big 0 energy suppliers and 0 small independents and isupplyenergy have the dubious honour of being the worst by a large_margin of the lot when it comes to customer service , ( and the bar is set pretty low in an industry notorious for a very low standard of service )!
negative	hopeless , useless , jobsworth , muppets that could not run a bath let_alone an energy company !
negative	their so - called customer service , ( if you ' re lucky_enough to get any at all from them ), is truly appalling and has to be experienced to be believed , ( though i would recommend you avoid all of the stress , effort & frustration involved and just stay_away )!
negative	i ' d say they are a joke but sadly i am not laughing !
negative	in taking the time to write this i hope you can avoid being their next victim !
negative	cheap , but just not worth the misery !!!
negative	my advice ; pay a little more with a reputable_company for the peace of mind that if something_goes_wrong you will be able to get help !
negative	i imagine isupplyenergy will go out of business before too_long ; lord knows what will then happen to all of the poor customers who have paid their hard_earned money upfront to these pretenders !!!
negative	you have been warned !
negative	stay safe , stay_away !
negative	-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
negative	update_: 00th_january_0000
negative	finally , after weeks and lots of emails and bucket loads of major frustration isupplyenergy have admitted their mistake !
negative	getting blood out of the proverbial stone is easier !
negative	they have apologised , promised to put right the mistake and offered £_00 as a goodwill_gesture , which is welcome but i would rather have avoided all of the time , hassle , effort and sheer frustration involved in getting them to treat me fairly in the first place !
negative	a simple look at the facts and numbers would have proved that a mistake had been made and that i was right .
negative	sometimes all it takes to solve a problem is for someone to actually properly look at the facts and make a few simple calculations to realise a mistake has_been made !
negative	00 seconds with a calculator or pen and paper would have solved this issue long before now and avoided all of the trouble !
negative	computer is not always right !
negative	it '_s a good job i '_m determined as most people would have given up long ago ; don_'_t let energy companies get away with overcharging , mistakes or terrible service , if you know you ' re right , like i was , stick to your guns and fight them !
negative	worst case they will ' deadlock ' the complaint and you can go to the independent ombudsman for a fair review and ruling - if , like in my case , the energy company are in the wrong the ombudsman will rule in your favour and award compensation , ( and this will cost the energy company more than if they had resolved it with you in the first place )!
negative	personally i ' d still recommend staying away from isupplyenergy unless they significantly improve their poor performance and dreadful service !
negative	--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
negative	update 00st january_0000
negative	oh my god !
negative	ffs !!!
negative	ahhhhh !!!
negative	unbelievable !!
negative	!
negative	despite all of their promises isupplyenergy have today produced a statement that is still wrong !
negative	they promised to revise the incorrect , disputed meter readings after realising their mistake , however they have failed to do so !
negative	you simply cannot trust anything this company say !
negative	they are absolutely clueless !!!
negative	what a joke !!
negative	!
negative	do not be their next victim !
negative	don_'_t go_anywhere_near isupplyenergy , only misery , frustration and overcharging awaits !
negative	avoid !!!!!!!!!
negative	!
negative	never received my order !
negative	contact them twice , first time i received the lamest excuses ..... 0nd time they just stopped responding !
negative	i had the worst booking experience i have ever had with a hotel .
negative	it was very hard to understand the agent i worked with .
negative	i could have dealt_with that though .
negative	i wanted to book 0 rooms for 0 nights at a comfort_inn in troy , wisc .
negative	i asked and was told 0 times that this hotel was in troy , wisc .
negative	after the booking i didn_'_t feel right so i called the number that the agent gave_me for the hotel only to find out it was over 00_minutes away from where i wanted to stay .
negative	then i was told my credit_card had been charged by expedia and i would have to go to them to get my money back .
negative	i then called your service again and got a lady that said she caught the charge and the card would not be charged .
negative	sunday my card was charged and i was told it would that 0 to 0 days before it would be made right .
negative	i now have about $_000 tied_up and had to book another hotel closer to troy .
negative	so i was lied to twice by your company and do not have many good things to say about you .
negative	i '_m not sure i will ever use you again
negative	got the wrong parts , will cost as much as my refund to return it .
negative	never buying car parts online again !!
negative	nothing like wasting money
negative	do not use this site get a direct phone_number to hotel you want to stay in .
negative	the reason to buy is only an interesting price in the articles , but in 0 orders with golfstoreeurope only 0 was a delivery time aceptable , the others probably was not in stock and the web_page had no the right information .
negative	i will not recomended anymore this shop ( i have a friend " javier picabea " with also product delayed and i recomended to him golfstoreeurope )
negative	oldies customer service sucks !
negative	there the same as gohastings and that '_s bad !
negative	there prices are to high !
negative	i had the worst experience from this site and i tried to contact them to tell them what happened and the website wouldn_'_t let_me send the complaint .
negative	i tried for 00_minutes to get it to go through with no luck and then i decided i was wasting my time because what company actually cares_about the customers ??
negative	but if anyone is interested ...
negative	here '_s what i initially wrote ...
negative	i recently ordered the valve_cover gasket kit for a 00 acura_tl 0 . 0l 0cyl .
negative	first , the package was put into a box more than twice it '_s size which in turn caused the idiot mailman to refuse to deliver it either to my mailbox or my home .
negative	this caused me to have to wait an extra 0 days for the package and much needed part for my car ... aside from the initial extra time i '_m forced to drive the vehicle in bad shape but then i had to go to the post_office across the city on my 00 minute lunch_break ...
negative	which took more than an_hour and a half to accomplish leaving me in trouble at work .
negative	then after all this ...
negative	i opened the box ( which was completely mangled and destroyed ) but the inner box was unopened and not tampered with , the sealed package only had 0 of the 0 valve seals inside !
negative	are you kidding me ??
negative	the receipt said the box should '_ve had 0 in it but it didn_'_t .
negative	i have pictures of all of this .
negative	if you want them , tell me .
negative	but this is ridiculous customer service and business ethic .
negative	i '_m so disappointed .
negative	it '_s not the fact that the missing part costs $ 0 ...
negative	it '_s the principal that i had to go somewhere_else to get the damn part that should '_ve been in this box .
negative	after i posted this review ...
negative	i read at_least 00 others with the sane complaints and they all day horrible customer service .
negative	good thing i didn_'_t waste time calling the company brevets from what everyone_else says , they don_'_t answer the phone and if they did respond , you have to pay for return shipping even_though tgey made the mistake .
negative	hell no .
negative	i went to o ' reilly '_s and bought the missing part for $ 0 and some change .
negative	way less_than the return shipping would '_ve been and less the hassle and time .
negative	this place won_'_t last with so many unhappy customers .
negative	the way this economy is , the lowest_prices will lure people in but good customer service keeps them coming_back .
negative	so the lesson here is spend the extra bucks and buy locally .
negative	you week what you ' re buying and they do care about your shopping_experience .
negative	good luck with your business parts_geek , you '_ll need it .
negative	i had to wait over 0 months to recieve my order because they would have it reserved then they would sell my furniture to other customers .
negative	my table broke in less then a week .
negative	i called they were too_busy to talked to me took my number to call me back never called .
negative	all around a bad_experience .
negative	i will never buy anything from american_freight again !
negative	i booked a trip to st . lucia through travelocity in februaury and two_days_later i recieved three e_-_mails advertising a $_000 offer for any trip book in excess of $ 0 , 000 .
negative	i called the customer service number to inquiry about receiving the $_000 off the trip that i had booked .
negative	i informed the person of the above information and asked about receiving the $_000 .
negative	i was on hold for several minutes and then was told that the offer was only good on trips booked after the e_-_mail was received .
negative	i told the person that i had boked a trip for $ 0 , 000 and i was sure there was a way to make the $_000 available .
negative	they indicated that there was not .
negative	i asked to talk to a supervisor and was put on hold for several more minutes .
negative	the supervisor came on the phone and repeated the same information and stated that they did not have the authority to do anything about it .
negative	i asked who would have the authortty , to which he indicated that his_supervisor would have that authority .
negative	i asked to talk to that person and was put on hold and subsequently cut_off .
negative	i still believe that your company could either reduce my bill by $_000_dollars or find way to give me a credit i can use on this trip .
negative	this is the second time i have had a less_than satisfactory experience with travelocity .
negative	i hesitated to use the service but it has_been several_years and i thought i would give it another try .
negative	if we can not resolve this issue i will not utilizing travelocity in the future .
negative	bernard orman .
negative	it said calling to china is 0 . 0 cent , but it is actually 0 . 0 cents
negative	this company should be put out of business !!
negative	their is no customer service at all !
negative	a canned reply email does not qualify for anything no matter_how many they send .
negative	no real people to answer a phone is ridiculous !!!!!
negative	and saying that a rep called and tried to get a hold of me when no one had is lying !
negative	i '_m going to file a complaint with the better business_bureau and new_jersey state commerce dept and any other regulating body .

negative	i ordered break rotors and break calipers for my infiniti .
negative	g00 .
negative	they sent out the products in 0 separate_shipments ( apparently ), but only emailed me one tracking_number .
negative	i called them 00 or more times when my calipers ( the expensive item ) didnt arrive when expected .
negative	no one answered ever .
negative	not sales , not help ... nothing , noone never .
negative	after staying on hold it hangs_up on you .
negative	i used their website to log my issues and got nothing for 0 days .
negative	they are horrible at communicating .
negative	i have never seen anything like it and i order everything on line .
negative	ebay sellers are much_better at customer service .
negative	i cant_believe they even consider what they have customer service .
negative	i am dreading what hoops ill have to jump_through to get my core_charge back .
negative	ordered a home_depot card but received an office depot card .
negative	the card had a sticker affixed with typing that said it was a home_depot card , and the amount , the card number , etc ...
negative	i made five calls before customer service told me i had to send the card back and they would refund my money .
negative	very poor experience with this company .
negative	i made copies of all correspondence , the front and back of the card , and typed up a letter to the person in charge stating the poor treatment i received .
negative	in the end , i did receive my refund , however i will not do_business with this company again .
negative	three months_ago i could buy $_000 gift_cards now i can only buy $_00 ones as have suddenly got a reduced maximum spend !!!
negative	first business i encountered that wants its customers to spend less .... idiots ... for security initially is fine but as a proven customer it '_s bizarre ...
negative	i '_ll find someone_else for my business
negative	i mistakently saw an_email for a hotel_room at best western which seemed to be a good price but after i received the confirmation the price was in euro '_s and when converted to u s $ the price was much more than the normal price on best western web_site .
negative	nice try but very deceptive .
negative	i would not look at this web_site again .
negative	placed order nearly 0_weeks before_christmas and the date keeps changing .
negative	it is christmas_eve today and now my package says expected delivery in 0 more days , dec 00 , not cool cuz this was a christmas_gift .
negative	talked to service rep and she said nothing she could do so i called back to the " corporate_office " 0 minutes later and the exact person answered the phone , must '_ve been a speedy promotion .
negative	shame on you ... all in all , after leaving her_supervisor a voice_message , as she was off of course , i also contacted customer service thru email ... i was given a code for 0 % on my next order !!!
negative	geez , don_'_t break the bank !
negative	extremely disappointed !
negative	i do understand that this is not entirely sw '_s fault as my ordered had been transferred to fedex on the 00th , but if they are going to continue to use fedex then i will hold them accountable for it taking me several weeks to receive my order , especially when my checking account had been charged immediately .
negative	i will gladly pay a few more dollars next time at gnc to have product in hand when they have my hard_earned $ in theirs
negative	i would not recommend talktalk their customers service is a disgrace .
negative	my line was out of action for 00 days , no apology or compensation .
negative	do not touch talktalk !
negative	da un momento all ' altro ti bloccano il conto e ti ridanno i soldi dopo 000 giorni chiedendo decine di documenti che anche_se inviati non vengono nemmeno guardati .
negative	da evitare
negative	the part i ordered was not the part i ordered had to pay to return it and could not get exchange for the right part .
negative	the whole_process is frustrating .
negative	i wouldn_'_t recommend to anyone to order from partsgeek !
negative	sehr geehrte damen und herren ,
negative	ich_war von ihrer letzten lieferung sehr enttaeuscht .
negative	die_blumen die ich aus den usa fuer den 00 geburtstag meiner mutter bei ihnen betsellt hatte , haben mich sehr enttaeuscht .
negative	es wurden billige blumen und sogar eine verwelkte rose benutzt .
negative	der blumenladen selber hat auf_die beschwerde ueberhaupt nicht reagiert .
negative	ich_habe dann von ihnen eine gutschrift ueber euro 00 .- bekommen .
negative	sollte ich in der zukunft wieder_bei ihnen bestellen , werde ich konkret angeben das ich keine blumen von diesem laden bekommen moechte .
negative	i recently got back into model railroading and have been buying most of my supplies on the internet .
negative	i found hobby linc and noted they have good prices so over the past 0 months i have spent well over $ 0 , 000 .
negative	on their site without a problem .
negative	on my most_recent order i received my shipment and 0 item was noted to be broken in the package and another one was not in a package but loose in the box with the package opened and left in the box ... there were also parts missing .
negative	i contacted the company and i was told since i did not pay for insurance i could return the items , but i would have to pay for shipping ?
negative	i told them the box the items arrived in was not damaged and therefore insurance would not have covered it ... the items were shipped in a damaged state .
negative	i was told that if you did not pay for insurance then they did not pay for the return even if it is their fault .
negative	i questioned them about this and i was told i would have to deal with the manufacturer for the item that was received damaged in the box .
negative	i asked why it was my responsibility to deal with the manufacturer if hobby linc sent out damaged goods to begin with ?
negative	i was told that was their policy .
negative	i pointed_out that their " policy " allowed them to put items they had on hand that were damaged in their warehouse into a box going to a customer and them have the customer deal with their damaged items !
negative	when i emailed them about the missing parts and asked that if theyt could at_least send the missing parts !
negative	i never received and answer to that email .
negative	buyer_beware !!!
negative	the prices are good but if anything is damaged when received good luck getting it taken_care of .
negative	it appears that hobby lincs has 0_star reviews from everyone that orders from them provided they do not have any damage to their order .
negative	however , everyone that has had problems with their order gives them a one star_review ....
negative	isn_'_t that interesting .
negative	i told them their policy needs some rethinking and told them they just lost a good customer
negative	my order was shipped monday ( 00 - 00 ) and apparently damaged on tuesday ( 00 - 00 ) at which time splash was notified and had the item returned to splash .
negative	it was received by splash thursday ( 00 - 00 ) at 0 :_00am .
negative	i was never notified , a new order was never sent out which should have been done on tuesday , and i haven_'_t received the pool closing_kit that i planned on using tomorrow to close my pool on my day off .
negative	i '_m very disappointed and i would like to know the status of my order .
negative	they advertised with google as free shipping and refused to honor it .
negative	customer service emails went_unanswered until they were answered with an_email claiming i never replied . i would not recommend this site , nor will i shop_here again .
negative	i will await contact from you , but i have sent multiple emails to feedback @ medisave . net , helpdeskusa @ medisave . net , rkaiser @ medisave . net and teamcs @ medisave . net .
negative	there are literally dozens of emails , most which are unasnwered .
negative	i will provide copies of all them to you if you so desire .
negative	unable to keep an_appointment .
negative	i had to rearrange plans for the afternoon .
negative	when i rang the head - office and spoke to andrew , they did not do as_promised which was to call me back .
negative	the gentleman that came was very pleasant and did a good job .
negative	overall , not impressed by the customer service .
negative	never use again , customer_satisfaction is low priority
negative	i ordered an item which was shown on the website ( a reel of yonex bg00ti badminton string in yellow ).
negative	eventually after several days i received an e_-_mail advising that the item was out of stock and now unobtainable .
negative	an unsuitable alternative was offered ( a reel of red string ).
negative	i pointed_out that i could buy the red string much_cheaper_elsewhere (£_00 instead of tennisnuts ' price of £_00 ) and was only interested in the yellow string and therefore requested a refund .
negative	instead of immediately giving a refund they sent another e_-_mail offering the unwanted red string cheaper_than tennisnuts ' original price but at £_00 i . e still £_00 more than i told them i could buy it for !
negative	??
negative	it took two more chasing e_-_mails to get a refund for an order that i would never have placed if their website had correctly shown that this item was not in stock / unavailable .
negative	i consider this to be extremely poor service and fortunately my regular supplier of racket strings is far more efficient .
negative	in response to tennisnuts ’ reply :
negative	whilst i accept that there was little they could do about getting new stock as the item has now been discontinued and there was a delay in them receiving this information , it is how this was handled after that point that was the problem .
negative	the offer of red string as an_alternative to yellow was not ‘ reasonable ’ in my estimation as the only reason for the order was specifically to obtain yellow string .
negative	there was no real discussion on prices as i was not in the market for a reel of red string although i did tell them that as i am a racket stringer i can get a 000m reel of yonex bg00ti badminton string at a discounted price of £_00 ( in fact , to be absolutely precise , after vat and postage and deduction of my discount it is £_00 . 00 all in , delivered , but £ 0 . 00 is hardly here or there ).
negative	this string is supplied by a highly reputable authorised yonex dealer ( apollo leisure ) and to suggest that they are not an authorised dealer and not supplying genuine product is both insulting to them and to me for insinuating that i would string my customers ’ rackets with anything other than genuine manufacturers ’ products .
negative	i have never , and will never , string rackets with string from a dubious source which may be fake or considered counterfeit or inferior in any way .. tennisnuts would do well to remember that their customers do know what products they are buying and why they are buying them .
negative	i ordered flat black frame black on black and got shiny one grey on top of the fact i order polarized_lenses and there not polarized now i '_m deployed and it had to send return mail and i '_m stuck with these glasses i don_'_t want , i will never us this service again .
negative	also i will discourage any current or new military member from using your
negative	company to get cheap sunglasses because you can '_t even get one order right .
negative	i had multiple methods of communicating with me but when target had their seciurity breached becu automatically re - issued all their debit_cards .
negative	it was that becu credit_card my ps bill was paid with automatically but it didn_'_t go through , and i did not get any communication_regarding the issue until i tried to get into my unit and was locked out .
negative	totally bad form .
negative	call me next time .
negative	i tried_contacting them thru their service number w_/_c went directly to their voice_mail .
negative	after an_hour of waiting and numerous tries i gave up and placed an order with another online store .
negative	i ordered a 0000_kia sportage bumper_cover in march and did not realize that it was the wrong part when i picked it up on march_00th ( it was for a friends car ) when i went to work with the part i realized it was wrong and tried to contact partgeek about this , email only and upto a 00 hour response time ( very poor ) i did not have my email from when i bought the part but i am sure i was shipped the wrong part , i was told in a response email that i had waited too_long to try to return the part ( april_00th ) and that i had to keep it .
negative	in the mean time i had placed another order with partsgeek for another bumper_cover to replace the wrong one i had been shipped .
negative	i replied to the email with the dates that i had , which was inside the 00 day return_policy , 0 days_later i received another email that my order would be returned and i should wait for an_email with return instructions ( another 0 days ) my second order was canceled and never sent and i am still stuck with the $_000 ( including delivery cost ) wrong part .
negative	i will never purchase from this company again and i will never recommend that anyone_else use this company for parts
negative	i requested for my tickets to be left at the kissimmee office , this was confirmed .
negative	on collection half my tickets was in kissimmee , the other half in the orlando office .
negative	not a very good service .
negative	let yourself down badly as a company .
negative	promised next_day delivery but did not get delivered next_day !
negative	waited in especially !
negative	when item was received the postage label revealed that it wasn_'_t even posted for next_day delivery .
negative	i even emailed to ask and was told ' hi ,
negative	yes your delivery left us yesterday so is out for delivery today
negative	regards
negative	neil cohen
negative	sales executive '
negative	bunch of liars !
negative	i waited almost 0_weeks for my free shipping of the parts and when they finaly came one of the boxes was riped open and one of the items that i ordered had 0 of the nuts missing i had spare nuts from the old part so i could finish the job i will never order parts from parts_geek again they really live up thier name geeks
negative	i have ordered lenses over a week_ago and as yet have not received them , tried to get customer service on your website but none was found ( big surprise )
negative	i have purchased twice from this company and now will never again shop there .
negative	after my order was totaled it qualified for free delivery , but due to going out f town the following week i opted to pay for a two day air .
negative	i received an_email about my order shortly_after paying and it issued me a tracking_number .
negative	stating that it was already on the way .
negative	i looked at the tracking_number for fedex and it was schedule to be delivered on the 0nd day which is what i paid for .
negative	then the next_day i just checked again to ensure all was on schedule and to my surprise it changed .
negative	now the delivery was changed to the following week on a monday .
negative	since i would be out of town i was very upset so upset in fact i emailed customer_support explaining my situation and why i was upset .
negative	all i got back was an i '_m sorry and here is our shipping policy .
negative	oh and we might need to make this more clear as you are not the only one that has had this complaint .
negative	so basically i feel i paid 00 dollars for shipping when i didn_'_t need to and customer service did not care .
negative	oh well their loss i will be more than happy to take my business elsewhere and never refer them again .
negative	i wouldn_'_t order anything from them cause i still have received my parts so i wouldn_'_t buy anything
negative	i got the ink like in 0 / 0 days but when i installed it in my printer the next_day the printer wasn_'_t printing anything so i cleaned the print head over and over wasting a lot of time .
negative	finally , i changed the ink again and the printer started printing with no_problems !!
negative	!
negative	expedia over booked the hotel i stayed at and ruin my trip .
negative	the hotel notified expedia about over booking and expedia was suppose get a hold of me and never call me .
negative	i found out about the over booking when i was checking in .
negative	worst experience ever .
negative	received the wrong part ... description describes a completely different part ... very misleading
negative	ordered rear_wiper for jeep_liberty - one listed as fit on website did not fit .
negative	the petflow cat_litter that i ordered is quite good and i appreciate having it delivered to my door .
negative	the pricing , however , was very high with " free shipping " offered one orders totaling just a dollar or two above what one large bag costs .
negative	this is a shameful attempt to manipulate me into ordering two bags of something that i had never tried before .
negative	i will not order from this compnay again .
negative	shame on you , petflow .
negative	i am still_waiting to receive this order !!!!!!!!!!
negative	!
negative	zero_stars , but this site doesn_'_t allow it .
negative	ordered a locking gas_cap .
negative	the item delivered was defective , the key couldn_'_t be operated rendering the cap the same as the oem model .
negative	this item also appeared to have been previously installed ( smudge marks on the sealing ring ).
negative	you can only contact partsgeek . com via their email - no customer service phone numbers .
negative	i clearly_explained the situation in my email to them .
negative	their email response was to issue a rma_number allowing the return - at my expense .
negative	they would then restock the item , charge a restocking_fee and issue a adjusted refund for the item only , not the return shipping , in 00 - 00 days .
negative	their policy is to cancel the order , you will have to place a new order to replace a defective item - with a new shipping charge applied .
negative	i would wind up paying three shipping_charges to replace a defective item .
negative	lesson leaned .
negative	i '_ll eat the loss on the initial purchase and never shop with partsgeek . com again .
negative	.
negative	first time customer .
negative	received a defective_part from parts_geek .
negative	tried_calling them on the phone to arrange a return and they did not answer the phone .
negative	tried again and they did not answer the phone but directed me via a recording to their website .
negative	got on website and they said they would get back to me in 00 - 00_hours .
negative	got return_authorization from website but it said i had to pay for return shipping .
negative	i finally got through to partsgeek on the phone and they agreed to pay for return shipping .
negative	returned part and i '_m crossing my fingers .
negative	i had to buy the part i needed from a local vendor to get my car back on the road .
negative	bottom_line for me : was very easy to order parts .
negative	trying to get hold of partsgeek on the phone to discuss a problem with a defective_part was extraordinarily difficult .
negative	it '_s very difficult to pick between a one star and a two star_rating .
negative	one star includes rude conduct which was not there .
negative	the person i finally got on the phone was helpful .
negative	otherwise the experience i had was unacceptable .
negative	i looked at the website that the link was supposed to go to : hampton_inn .
negative	now i learn that i did not even talk with anyone at hilton_honors or the hotel .
negative	i even asked if this was the hotel and the person said yes .
negative	this is dishonest and imho illegal .
negative	these_guys should be shut_down as a spam site .
negative	had a0 day pass , first day took 0 hours to do circuit then told to get off as bus not going any further , had to walk back to hotel .
negative	second day not much_better caught bus to train_station to meet young son bus went 0 stops and we were asked to move to bus in front got on bus and they said bus was not going for 00_minutes had to get off and catch taxi very annoying .
negative	i recently made a reservation for a hilton_garden inn and the person taking my reservation could hardly speak_english .
negative	made it difficult to understand and didn_'_t feel comfprtable giving out my financial information .
negative	i am recent customer of onlineticketexpress and i can say only bad and very bad things about this company .
negative	i really don_'_t believe that any of the positive_reviews listed here are true .
negative	here is the mail i have send to them after finalizing whole deal ( tickets for the first game euro 0000 poland - greece )
negative	" ok you want me to give my comments about deal through you company than here you have .
negative	first i didn_’ t received tickets i ordered . i ordered 0 tickets so called vip gold which of course were most expensive with information that they would be best avalaible seats on the side tribunes .
negative	i havent ’ t got those i received instead 0 tickets of 0 category nominal value of 0 ticket 000 zł approx 000_euro ( i paid 000_euro ).
negative	so i feel_cheated by you with no word explanation .
negative	if you consider yourself fair , professional and service minded company i should get some kind of compensation .
negative	secondly the way you handled whole deal was disaster .
negative	in the order confirmation you wrote that tickets should be delivered 0 - 0 days before the event .
negative	in fact i haven ’ t got any information earlier_than just one day before .
negative	i tried to to get info by phone but this was impossible neither of your phone numbers answered .
negative	i should get my tickets delivered to my private address instead i got info that i must collect them myself at the airport on the specific time actually very late just 0 hours before the event .
negative	luckily i live in warsaw what if i didn_’ t ’?
negative	i was at the airport earlier_than you recommended namely 0 . 00_pm and it was another lucky case not only for me but also for other people who decided to buy tickets through you .
negative	at tnt nobody was aware of shipment under the number i got from you because it was not in the system .
negative	but there was guy_who tried to communicate with tnt personel who hardly spoke_english .
negative	i help them and it turned_out that he was private courier who brought tickets from you among them also mine .
negative	i asked people from tnt to call all other people and inform them also about their tickets .
negative	i hope that they got them on time .
negative	summarizing my experience from working with you was very bad even more as i explained in the beginning i feel_cheated .
negative	i am waiting for you prompt reaction before i place my comments on all avalaible review websites .

negative	i bought my fender_flares that did not show the thickness .
negative	the picture did not look like the thickness of the ones i received .
negative	figured if i didn_'_t like them parts_geek had a 00 day return guarantee .
negative	i received them they look massive on my truck and made my wheels look small and out of place . my flares had a 0 0 / 0 edge on them from the truck body out .
negative	i have 00 x 00 . 00 on 00 in rims and they looked tiny .
negative	like i had lowed my truck with aggressive fender_flares still on it .
negative	i contacted parts_geek immediately .
negative	i had to wait several days to get a response that told me to wait another 0 days for a return #.
negative	after returning the parts had to wait about 00 days to get an_email_telling_me they took 00_% restocking_fee and it will be another 0 to 0 days more .
negative	i will not buy from parts_geek again .
negative	ever .
negative	please learn from my misfortune .
negative	my model car is known to have a less_than stellar window_motor design .
negative	i had previously ordered a replacement from amazon and it lasted 0 years before going bad again , which unfortunately is par for the course on my car .
negative	however , this time , i noticed i could get it cheaper from parts_geek with a core swap .
negative	i ordered two replacement window_motors for my car , one for each side .
negative	the passenger motor arrived and worked just as expected .
negative	the driver_side motor was dead on arrival , something i suspect happens occasionally since all of the motors are refurbished ; no big_deal .
negative	i went to contact parts_geek for a replacement and noticed that they only way to contact them is via a web form on their website .
negative	no phone_number listed anywhere .
negative	i submitted the web form and they set_up the rma , except they want me to be responsible for shipping .
negative	after requesting multiple_times for them to call me to resolve the issue and finally threatening to dispute the credit_card transaction , i got this reply from them :
negative	hello ,
negative	all returns are freight prepaid by the customer .
negative	we do not offer return shipping reimbursement regardless of the party at fault .
negative	thank_you .
negative	so i will be disputing the charge with my credit_card company and never doing_business with them again .
negative	next time , it '_s back to amazon or a more trusted auto_parts store .
negative	website stock and availability needs improving .
negative	unfortunately dear_friend parts_geek , may be you did right your work , but the part i pay for it , never ridge my house , i contacted fed_ex , reference to them , they just place it in front of my door , but i never see it , no my neighbors , and no the rental office of the building , they cut ' nt miss my address , i '_m in the first door , in the first floor of the building .
negative	so , if you leave in a apartment building , your package have no probabilities to ridge your place .
negative	no one answers phone clls at night
negative	i ordered shock mounts for a0000 chevy silverado and i have only received one .

negative	i want my money back or the part .

negative	the technician did the job fast , however i may have an issue with the balancing as i '_m now getting a wobble at 00 which was not their before .
negative	i '_ll have this tested independently and if appropriate deal with kwikfit .
negative	i have noted others question the balancing !
negative	their clear packaging tape does not have easy - start tabs at the beginning of the roll .
negative	the tabs are about 0 / 0 " back from the beginning of the tape so they are no help at all .
negative	worse : i talked to a very nice and understanding customer service agent casey but their " quality control dept " didn_'_t care about the problem .
negative	they thought it was ok that way , and clearly either don_'_t have a clue what the tab is supposed to do , or just don_'_t care .
negative	it is possible that they get their tape from the reject batches of tape factories ; no one would make tape this way on purpose .
negative	i have contacted other tape distributors and they have proper start - tabs on their tape in the correct place .
negative	you are left with the decision to just live with the extra work involved in starting each roll and tell yourself that the cheap price is worth it , or paying a little more for correctly made tape from a company that cares .
negative	this company has lousey customer service .
negative	i ordered an interior panel ( pn : 000 - 000 / black ) through parts_geek .
negative	they shipped the wrong color panel ( pn : 000 - 000 / tan ) and now they expect me to pay for return shipping .
negative	i was told that they would e_-_mail me a prepaid shipping_label but have yet to see one .
negative	it '_s their screw - up they should fix it and pay for shipping .
negative	can not send part back an it ant been 00 days yet cant talk to nobody !!!!!!!!
negative	!
negative	there web_site is down , so you call and make your payment and they charge you a fee to do it that way .
negative	what a scam , they should waive fee until web_site back up and running .
negative	three_days way too_long for site to be down .
negative	must have high schoolers as it techs .
negative	i bought a radiator from best bathroom and assumed this was what you were referring to .
negative	it was only as i click off i realised it was the wrong company !
negative	i was on the bathempire website looking for a radiator , but none of them suited my requirements .
negative	so please remove the comment i just made as it actually referred to another company .
negative	sorry about that and frustratingly it tool more of my time !
negative	the last order i placed took_longer_than the other ive placed in the past .
negative	also the box with the mirror in it was dirty and dusty from sitting on the shelf .
negative	then when i opened the main shipping box , some one put an empty roll of tape in the box .
negative	if the company is going to start getting sloppy .
negative	i think ill buy else where .
negative	very unhappy .....................
negative	i wanted to purchase a white ceramic chanel j00 watch for my fiancee for xmas .
negative	after_researching the watches i only had one concern ... size .
negative	it comes in several diameters ranging_from 00 mm up to 00 + mm .
negative	before ordering , i called and spoke to a salesman and explained my concern .
negative	i knew i didn_'_t want the largest of the watches .
negative	he asked me what watch she was currently wearing and that was a tag .
negative	he told me tags were 00 mm and that would be my best choice .
negative	he also said that the 00 mm was the most_popular white ceramic chanel j00 women '_s watch .
negative	that '_s what i ordered .
negative	well ... the tag wasn_'_t 00 mm and the most_popular chanel of this type isn_'_t the 00 mm one , it is the 00 mm .
negative	i called to see if i could exchange it and sure ... with a 0 % restocking_fee !
negative	over $_000 , for relying on the salesman .
negative	i feel_like i got screwed by the salesman and luxury of watches .
negative	by the way , this isn_'_t my first purchase from luxury of watches , but after this i will never buy from them again or recommend them .
negative	i still have several weeks before_xmas but i don_'_t know what i can do .
negative	i feel stuck with a watch that cost over $ 0000 .... the whole mess sucks .
negative	don_'_t listen to their recommendations and , based on the way i was treated i would recommend purchasing your watches from some other dealer other than luxury of watches .
negative	this company is the worst on the net .
negative	their service is terrible .
negative	they expect you to pay for their mistakes .
negative	lots of stupid caring messages from names that keep changing .
negative	seriously - buy glasses from anyone_else .
negative	even main street shops are better .
negative	navigation is difficult , filters do not work correctly and prices can change during your search or when you submit to purchase the ticket .
negative	i avoid using this site at all costs when buying airline_tickets .
negative	my girlfriend and i bought tickets at the same time on different computers , clicked send at the same time and hers was rejected while mine went through .
negative	the message on her computer was that the flight was no_longer available at that price .
negative	it was now $_00 more .
negative	if there is any other option available i will use that instead of this site .
negative	this site sucks .
negative	i ordered from supplementmarket . com , and received the supplements in a timely_fashion .
negative	however , when the shipment came , i noticed that one of the products was not the same as the one i ordered .
negative	i called them , and somehow their " answering message " girl picked_up , told me that the office people might be busy so the call got diverted to their answering service .
negative	i told her my problem , and she took down my name and number , to forward it to the " office " staff , and they would call me back .
negative	waited a day , and no call back .
negative	the next_day i called again , and surprise , the " answering " girl picked_up , with the same line " give me your contact info " and we will get back to you .
negative	i explained to her it was my second time calling , and gave her the info again .
negative	0 hours go by , its coming close to end of business day , and still no call back .
negative	i called them again a third time , and surprise , surprise , the answering girl picks_up with the same line .
negative	i got fed - up with trying to reach them , cc company will be notied for a swift dispute .
negative	they hire answering_machine people just to take messages ??
negative	would it be easier , and quicker if the answering_machine operators took_care of consumer problems ??
negative	i suspect that they have a very poorly run operation with one person answering phones , and the other shipping items .
negative	they communication and customer service is the lowest .
negative	i gave them not0 , not 0 but 0 chances to make it right , but they will not listen .
negative	i am an active member of several fitness and bodybuilding boards , and i will make my reviews about this company known to their customer base .
negative	ordered an oil_pan first and was really surprised in came in 0 days after i ordered it .
negative	i was impressed .
negative	then i forgot to order a gasket so i ordered one and it never came .
negative	i waited over 00 days .
negative	no_explanation why they just gave_me my money back .
negative	to me thats bad business .
negative	i have ordered parts from them before with no problem and will probably order from them again but would still like to know why i couldn_'_t get a simple gasket when i ordered one .
negative	i bought a $_00 card tried to turn it in at perfect world ... after entering the code was instructed i owed $ 0 . 00 ... did not explain how i was to pay that ... tried to get money back .... failed .... have been burned for $_00 ... not very happy .
negative	i thought i was ordering a pair of gloves .
negative	boo , on me for not reading the fine_print .
negative	when i looked back on the page where i made the order , it did state one spot that the order was for one glove .
negative	boo , on halloweencostumes . com for being misleading .
negative	the " one glove " fine_print should have more apparent .
negative	who orders only one glove ?
negative	could you imagine ordering only one shoe ?
negative	also , there is no where to indicate if someone wants a right or left glove .
negative	this would have been a fair indicator / notice that i would only get one glove .
negative	i decided to go to local costume store to avoid getting another right glove .
negative	i take online ordering seriously because companies easily rip people off with fees , misleading descriptions , and restocking_fees .
negative	i tell_everyone about how halloweencostumes . com is misleading .
negative	the ink wasn_'_t hp and it jammed my pinter up and i had to take it apart to pry it out .
negative	i will not use inkfarm anymore .
negative	sadly id like to say this was good but simply cant they sent me the wrong part even after my emailing sandstrom about the usb lead to charge my bluetooth headphones did not get the order right i was assured the part i wanted was correct despite my querying the picture on the partmaster website i was assured this was just a stock picture and they would send me the correct part so i ordered it but when it arrived it was wrong id even included a photo of the original pin type connector not micro usb type that they sent me i have since returned it for a refund and will have to search elsewhere for the correct lead i need .
negative	parts were mis labeled .
negative	customer service was horrible .
negative	don_'_t even try calling a phone_number for these_people .
negative	shipping on my package was ridiculous .
negative	i had to badger them in order to get my refund after a month and a half .
negative	i wish someone would shut_down troublesome internet companies like this one .
negative	i think it '_s sleazy .
negative	to advertise a rate .
negative	then tell the customer that you have to have insurance at an_additional_cost per_month at signup
negative	i won_'_t use again , i don_'_t trust their exchange_rates .
negative	i thought i was renting a student_edition and you sent me a teachers edition .
negative	i cannot honestly turn in my work with this book already having all the answers .
negative	i specifically selected a student_edition when i rented the book .
negative	needless to say i am pretty frustrated as i now have to work this out with my school , hopefully i can drop the course and pick it up at a later date without it costing me too much money .
negative	sorry , but i have had a very bad_experience and i probably will never buy any parts from you again .
negative	well i went to what i thought was the hotel '_s site and made a reservation .
negative	this was your site .
negative	then i called the hotel_directly to ask for some special_requests .
negative	the hotel informed me there were no rooms available and they had been 000_% booked for some time .
negative	they also said to not use un - trustworthy sites that do not have updated information and to call back and try to get my money back asap !
negative	you sent me the wrong part which did not match the paperwork you sent with the part and then made me pay for the return shipping !
negative	i have nine vehicles and i '_m always buying parts .
negative	the prices looked good so i thought i would try them .
negative	out of five parts i ordered the first one i received was for a different vehicle . i can see where that happens but they are making me pay to return it .
negative	that is no way to run a bussiness making a customer to pay for lack of compidence .
negative	made an online reservation through a partner site .
negative	received an e_-_mail saying the unit was available at any time from the date of reservation until the move in date .
negative	drove to storage_facility 00 days prior to reservation .
negative	property_manager lied and said he called me , " never did " and said reservation was only for 00hours and he did not have a unit for me .
negative	i showed him the e_-_mail confirmation and asked where it said that .
negative	he didn_'_t have an answer .
negative	said he might be able to still get me a unit by my moving date .
negative	i told_him don_'_t bother and he wasted my time .
negative	very disappointed .
negative	will not be recommending them to anyone anytime_soon .
negative	poor customer service .
negative	two_weeks still_waiting on shock_absorbers , only automated_replies no service
negative	are you kidding me with a review .. they sent my mirror cover s supposedly to the wrong_address .
negative	clearly on there site my address was correct ... no one gets back to you .. first i had ups .. with fake tracking_numbers then fedx with wrong_address .. company is a joke .. there is no customer service .. stay_away ...
negative	i bought on ebay squaretrade extended_warranty for my nikon d0x , i send my camera with their service provided to be repair but this people still my cap , eye viewer and original retail box , after 0 day '_s they call me and offer me my " money back " ......$ 00 . 00 the price of the warranty because the warranty doesn_'_t cover the sensor repair ... to day is 00 days after that and i '_m still_waiting for my money back ........ fraud !!
negative	!
negative	first of all , i think partsgeek should be up front about shipping of returning the core is to be paid by customers .
negative	i would suggest , the price of the part should include the core_return shipping , so there are no_hidden cost for the customers .
negative	secondly , the quality of my part ( 0 port fuel injector assembly ) is bad - one of the port is has a defective solenoid , so it is not injecting gas .
negative	bad luck ?
negative	partsgeek should have tested all parts before send to customers .
negative	third , the returning the core experience is something of this world - the customers have to baby sit the process .
negative	it should be easy for customer to return the core .
negative	what i have to do was , i have to create a support_ticket via the website .
negative	i then i an_email_saying they received the ticket .
negative	and then i received the email regarding how to return the core .
negative	after i returned the core , at_least 0_weeks , i got no word from partsgeek .
negative	i check my credit_card and see the core is not refunded .
negative	so i called , but the automated phone directed me to file a ticket .
negative	the whole thing can be improved by such as put an instruction_sheet in the box that the part came with .
negative	i '_ll tell my friends not to buy from partsgeek .
negative	it is so frustrating .
negative	i can '_t even talk to partgeek .
negative	i hope you can improve for future customers and do not need to gone_through the bad_experience .
negative	i '_m a diy ' er i have a 0000_ford_mustang , 0000_ford_explorer , 0000 durango , 0000 holiday rambler , 0000 speed boat 0000 case tractor , i have breakdowns all the time but i '_ll shop elsewhere .
negative	crap !!!!!!!!!!
negative	!
negative	too slow
negative	we had to leave town with the food behind
negative	we understand that many people from the us and europe use this web_site to book thier get away .
negative	that being said , when you make your reservation online and then an error is sent back that our reservation didn_'_t go through , and it says to call the reservation number .
negative	calling the reservation number , we again book everyone ( which takes another 00_minutes for 0 of us ) the agent says the flights changed and again the reservation didn_'_t go through .
negative	another 00_minutes later , the same thing happens .
negative	i would normally think this was an isolated case but it took us literally 0_weeks to book our vacation having been frustrated everytime we tried .
negative	the senario happened every time we called until the 0rd time today .
negative	this is a very frustrating process and i do not want to use this service again .
negative	definitaly trying another travel_agent next time after using this one the last three years in a row ....... sorry .
negative	parts delived on time
negative	part was in a timken box but bearing is not a timken
negative	name on bearing is koyo
negative	if timken is not on bearing , it is not a timken bearing .
negative	would like what i ordered .
negative	ordered my part waited one week , they sent the wrong part . i can '_t get anyone on the phone , still have the old parts can '_t get them returned no one will call me an all i want to make me happy is send me the parts i ordered so i may finish my project .
negative	maybe you guys can get someone from parts_geek to call my name is shane hollis 000 - 000 - 0000
negative	ordered a console on the tuesday_morning for a present the following_monday .
negative	dealt_with in the past and very good communication .
negative	item wasn_'_t dispatched .
negative	phoned thursday_evening to be told was out of stock and will be in on friday and dispatched for the monday .
negative	phoned late friday and was told stock in it will going .
negative	it wasn_'_t , then received a email_saying i had placed a new order which will then be sent on monday ..
negative	very angry that i was lied to , they did redeem themselves by the minimum by redirecting the parcel so i got 0 day late for a birhday
negative	i paid to have 0s for att instant unlock and still_waiting as my order is still processing and no answer to any of my emails .
negative	i ordered a couple of parts on the same invoice !
negative	one of the parts was not available but all your email said was a part was not in inventory .
negative	i had no_idea which one .
negative	i needed those parts asap .
negative	i called 0 times and never got a hold of anyone but it did hang_up on me each time after 0 minutes on hold .
negative	i then wrote to you and got a canned_response that had nothing to do with what i mentioned in me email .
negative	i wrote again and got another canned_response , still not responding to what i said .
negative	i will be working with ebay from now on as they respond so they don_'_t get a bad review where you don_'_t care !!!
negative	!
negative	bought a russian key of rage from them , and it '_s not working because they only sent me the sewers dlc key and not the actual game key .
negative	they issued a statement in facebook that their supplier mixed up the keys .
negative	also they advertise that they send actual photo scans of the boxes , which is not true , because i haven_'_t received it , only an_email with the key .
negative	without the photo scan , i don_'_t have any proof that the key is legit or not .
negative	they are still selling the game on their website without_warning potential_customers that there aren_'_t keys available for the game .
negative	until my issue with rage is fixed , i leave a poor rating .
negative	i placed an order for 0000_volvo control_arm and ended_up having the worst experience from online shopping .
negative	when the mechanic tried to install the part he was not able to do so so i had to pay him because he had to remove the prior arm and i got stuck with the wrong item .
negative	i specifically had order the part for my year in their search_engine .
negative	what was the most frustrating was the return process i had to pay 00_% of the value of the item just to ship it back worst of all this company does not cover shipping even if they are at fault .
negative	on top of that i am still concerned_about restocking_fees when they cause me time money .
negative	i am very dissapointed in their ill get back to you in 0 days by email customer service and return_policy i ended_up paying 0 times what the part was worth because of parts_geek .
negative	normalt er vi_ikke sarte , men vi troede ikke det_var muligt , at en vinduespudser kunne være så sjusket og udvise sådan_en mangel på respekt for folks hjem .

negative	don_'_t know yet how can i rate you when i still_haven ; t received my order ?
negative	i was making a reservation for a hotel , and had asked for a government_rate .
negative	and was told no , they don_'_t do that !
negative	i had stayed at the same hotel a week past , and was given the lower rate , i then told them i will call the hotel myself and make the reservations .
negative	and to cancel what i had started with them , and was told i still have to pay for the full_amount they had told me about .
negative	while on the phone !
negative	no way , was i going to pay it !
negative	!
negative	i then hung_up on that person , and called back to a person , who talked to her_supervisor , and had the whole thing canceled .
negative	but my card still got charged !!
negative	!
negative	that is not acceptable !!
negative	less then 00 sec to take your money and 0 - 0 days to get the money back ??
negative	is that company that hard up for money ??
negative	?
negative	i googled " holiday_inn new ulm " and called the number to what i thought was the holiday_inn hotel reservations directly .
negative	the individual answered the phone " holiday_inn reservation_counter " and told me 0 rooms were available for the night .
negative	i booked 0 after being told that there was a " hotel shuttle service " available to pick us up at the small general aviation airport .
negative	when i was asked for my payment information , i tried to provide my ihg member number which has all my information , and was told i would need to provide that to the receptionist when i got to the hotel .
negative	later i found out there was not a shuttle service and there has never been one at this hotel .
negative	we had to wait almost an_hour for a taxi .
negative	upon_arriving at the holiday_inn i found out i had been tricked by expedia , who was pretending to be holiday_inn and therefore was not eligible to receive my ihg member points since i had paid expedia for the room and not holiday_inn .
negative	points aside , i was most frustrated by being told there was a hotel shuttle service available when there was not ( costing us an extra $_00 taxi round_trip ).
negative	also found out that had i actually booked with holiday_inn like i thought i did , the rooms would have been less_expensive .
negative	i made a purchase almost 0_weeks_ago and i am still_waiting .
negative	why don_'_t you get a more ruputable carrier than usps .
negative	they are very inefficient and they never update their shipments ; so tracking your order is just useless .
negative	it takes only 0 business days for me to receive an order of about the same weight as my glasses from amazon . com and the shipping fee is around $ 0 . 00 .
negative	i will not recommend your company to any serious minded customer looking for glasses .
negative	placed an order on the 00th , chased on the 00st only to be told it had not been shipped and would be with me in 0 working days .
negative	chased a second time on 00st where they still couldn_'_t tell me if it has_been dispatched .
negative	waste of time on all accounts .
negative	i ordered parts over 0 week_ago and 0 days_later just received a tracking_number stating my package was sent .
negative	0 days_later i '_m still_waiting !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
negative	you call the customer service number and get a recording stating go to the web_site , which after 0 inquires cuts you off so there is no way to contact parts_geek and you just sit and wait !!!!!!!!!!!!!!
negative	i '_m so done with parts_geek !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

negative	had to wait for 0 hours for the car .
negative	tried to talk us into taking out accident excess_insurance at € 00 per day .
negative	the air con didn_'_t work and the gps they gave_us the wrong cable so went flat after 0 / 0 hour from the airport .
negative	went to a branch office who were no help .
negative	had to alter our trip because we got lost , wasted hours trying to find hotel and get back to the airport from sorrento .
negative	i would never use them again , everybody waiting to get a car was very upset at the long wait with slow service by a few staff , no seating near the counter to view your ticket number made it even worse .
negative	i purchased a bosch induction_hob for my wife as a part of a new kitchen fitting , it was to be a surprise for her , no birthday or anniversary , just a surprise present .
negative	it transpired that you need special magnetic pots and pans to use on the induction_hob .
negative	as a consequence i went online to find the earliest delivery available for such utensils ; the hob being hidden in our garage until the pots were delivered .
negative	on friday 00st september i found a site for hispek_electronics , which boasted five working days delivery on items bought ; the price was virtually identical to that of other_suppliers , but the selling factor was the 0 day promise .
negative	i therefore completed the order form and made payment , but at this time was informed that the delivery time was now extended to 0 to 0 working days .
negative	having navigated the requisite pages i decided to make the payment anyway , many companies i deal with , have a safety time factor built in , but deliver way ahead of forecast .
negative	on the following_day ( saturday 00nd ) i received acknowledgement of my order .
negative	on friday 00th_september i received an advice that my package had been despatched that day .
negative	the package duly_arrived on tuesday 0nd october ; the franking on the package showed the pans had actually been sent on monday 0st october .
negative	without claiming to be a mathematical genius , i estimated that even assuming that saturdays were not counted for packing and dispatch purposes , the friday / mon / tues / wed / thurs / fri / and then mon of the following week , must surely amount to seven working days .
negative	thus my wait exceeded even their maximum scenario .
negative	the surprise present for my wife was to my mind unnecessarily delayed , actually arriving finally on a day when i had to make a trip abroad , which compounded the aggravation .
negative	i could probably have gone to any of at_least five or six other_companies who without professing to offer an express service , might well have got the goods to me in a much_quicker timespan more especially in view of the fact that the transportation seems only to have taken a single day !
negative	well hispek_electronics , you asked for a review of your service ; the ball is in your court now !
negative	it was not possible change the or cancel booking .
negative	parts_geek will sell u parts at a good price but do not follow through with the order .
negative	i ordered a oil_pan with a new drab plug and seal and they did not include the seal .
negative	when i emailed them they told me they would not ship the seal to me and i could just return it .
negative	would not help me they were very rude and i would not suggest anyone to buy from them .
negative	my part was to show up on the 0 / 00 / 0000 .
negative	still_waiting for the part .
negative	it not good when a person is waiting for a part and it dose not show up .
negative	sent me the wrong part , can '_t talk to anyone about it .
negative	it '_s been over 0 week and i still don_'_t have the correct part and they want me to pay to return the incorrect one .
negative	they only communicate via_email , and i have not heard back from them .
negative	if i don_'_t hear from them soon i will contest the charge with amex , they will take my call .
negative	very bad_experience david ezra ( 000 ) 000 - 0000
negative	i paid_extra for a saturday_morning delivery that never arrived .
negative	after_contacting customer service they admitted to losing the order .
negative	the company said that the order would be resent , but the flowers were still never delivered .
negative	there has_been no response from customer service since .
negative	i ' d really love to talk to someone on the phone , but you don_'_t even list a phone_number .
negative	i ' d love to not need to pay a restocking_fee , since that the standard in business these days .
negative	because of the 0 above issues and your tiny return window and company guarantee ( your site makes your guarantee look great , but the fine_print tells the truth -- you don_'_t stand by your product or your company ), i will not be able to order from partsgeek . com in the future .
negative	i ' d prefer to go to advance_auto '_s site or order from amazon . com .
negative	auto_europe only takes the payment , then places your order with a rental company - in this case europcar - you have no choice here .
negative	the payment was smooth ; however , the troubles started with europcar - of course the automatic i reserved was not available .
negative	of course , i had to pay more for a manual car - had clutch problems and returned it ( via tow truck ) within one hour .
negative	guess what ?
negative	the original automatic i rented was now available .
negative	will never rent through auto_europe or europcar ever again !

negative	my personal home circumstances are a 00 yr_old living with us and a lifeline alert system is present in the event of emergency .
negative	( he has suffered three falls in the house ).
negative	my wife is 0 months pregnant .
negative	we establish a there is a fault present on our line , broadband upload speed 0 . 00mbs .
negative	can '_t make landline calls or receive them .
negative	fault reported to orange staff .
negative	while waiting for the call to be answered from my orange mobile_phone , i am told that ' orange prides_itself on it '_s excellent customer care '.
negative	what a joke !
negative	i am asked to dismantle my phone sockets and do tests otherwise i may be liable for a £_000 fee .
negative	i am then told by the same non uk operative that my fault would be treated as a priority but she couldn_'_t report it because their systems were down for maintenance .
negative	( this was on a saturday_afternoon ).
negative	she stated that once systems were back up she would log the defect and call me back on my mobile .
negative	it goes without saying i never got a call back or even a text .
negative	it took a second call to get the fault recorded on the next_day .
negative	the earliest day would be in 0 days time , having been asked a preferred visit time i selected a . m . ( i wonder_why !)
negative	my wife took time off work at a cost to her .
negative	it goes without saying the engineer never came .
negative	i rang to find out why no one attended and was told i would have to re book the visit .
negative	no reason given !
negative	( could it have been because it had never been booked in the first place ) imagine how i felt !
negative	i chose not to speak with them and to arrange my telephone and broadband service from another provider .
negative	i have raised formal complaints with orange about the actions of it ; s staff during this whole matter , by e_mail on the address they gave_me .
negative	they have responded saying the matter will be dealt_with within 00_hrs .
negative	guess what , they haven_'_t responded after 0 days !
negative	i will take this to the regulator .
negative	this company '_s service is the lowest of the low .
negative	i have been a loyal orange customer via mobile for many , many_years but this ' service ' has ensured i will leave them , even if it costs me money and never return for any service they may choose to provide .
negative	this review is totally honest in every word .
negative	no one should ever be expected to have to suffer this .
negative	do not use them .
negative	this whole_ordeal started on 0 / 0 / 00 .
negative	i received that order on 0 / 00 / 00 .
negative	opened up the case pulled out the glasses and the left lens fell right out , i sent these back that day and craig called me 0 / 00 apologizing for this terrible quality control .
negative	how could someone send out a pair of glasses when the lens didn_'_t even fit right . so craig informed me i would get expedited treatment and a lens upgrade .
negative	0 - 00 days and here we are 0 / 00 with no new glasses .
negative	i was sent out an e_-_mail yesterday to review a product that from what i just found out is still in the lab .
negative	i called on 0 - 00 and was told my order was shipped and would receive yesterday 0 / 00 what a bunch of lies and poor customer service .
negative	looks_like i '_m done with this service
negative	i went_ahead and saved myself an extra $_00 by ordering through wiggle .
negative	" i can wait a little_longer ", i told myself .
negative	" after all , with - in - 00 business days to the united_states seems like a long time , but i can wait . "
negative	big mistake .
negative	here i am over half a month later with no item , and losing valuable training time by the day .
negative	i contacted wiggle after 00 business days and i was told it would take them up to 00_hours to respond to an_email .
negative	( at_least they met that time frame ) .
negative	i did not receive an update or estimated time of delivery on my item .
negative	i was simply told that i could not be helped until 00 business days .
negative	yes , i have to wait for over a month before i can even begin to get my money back or report an item lost .
negative	i could have waited a little_longer_than if i had ordered through amazon , but this is just way too_long , and with absolutely no updates or tracking no .- this is just blind shopping .
negative	i fully regret ordering through wiggle .
negative	i bought a break master_cylinder for my sons 00 land_rover .
negative	he is stuck out in penn valley ca .
negative	it went out when he was traveling and they told_him they had to order the part from land_rover and this could take two_weeks .
negative	i went on parts_geek , com and they had five to pick from .
negative	the first two said w_/ o reservoir and they did not show the reservoir on them .
negative	the next one down did not say w_/ o reservoir and it did show the reservoir on the master_cylinder .
negative	so i ordered that one , when they got it out in ca .
negative	they called me and said it did not come with the reservoir .
negative	i called partd geek , i was on hold for two and a half hours !!!!!!
negative	no one picked_up .
negative	i had to order a reservoir from land_rover $_000 . 00 my son has_been stuck in ca .
negative	for almost two_weeks .
negative	parts_geek just says sorry and return it .
negative	i dont have time !!
negative	the website is so misleading .
negative	i fix all my cars and trucks myself .
negative	i will never buy from you again . i have never in my life ever taken the time to complain_about customer service .
negative	i work in customer service and i know things can happen .
negative	but this was just over the top bad !!!!
negative	i live in delaware and i was trying to help my son who is stuck on the west_coast .
negative	thanks and merry_christmas !!!!
negative	!
negative	product was damaged but i was able to some old parts to get my wife '_s van going .
negative	when i bought diablo_0 i was under the assumption that i had the global eu_version , even for that price .
negative	but instead , what i got was a russian limited version where i can only play in russian .
negative	now i have to buy a new gamecode to be able to play the game in english .
negative	i have contacted the website but no response yet
negative	i would never buy anything from parts_geek and i would never recommend them to anyone .
negative	latest order arrived damaged with one product unusable .
negative	contacted customer service .
negative	no response after 0 days .
negative	disappointing
negative	very bad .
negative	unacceptable experience .
negative	i '_m now stuck with a bunch of filters that i paid for that don_'_t fit .
negative	they say the width is 0 " but they actually measure 0 0 / 0 " in width and thus don_'_t work .
negative	my goods are not here i have been charged where is my order there is no phone_number for me to check
negative	i was astonished to find that this " travel service " charged my credit_card three_times for the same , one night hotel stay .
negative	when i called to complain i was told that the 0 erroneous charges would be reversed , plus the $ 0 : 00 charges to ' make_sure i had money in the account " ( what ?
negative	), and was given confirmation numbers for these reversal which were supposed to take place within 00_hours .
negative	when i called back , 00_hours_later i was told that there were no erroneous charges and that the confirmation numbers i had been given " did not mean anything ".
negative	i would caution any potential customer from giving any credit or debit_card information to these_people since they can '_t be trusted to make a simple hotel reservation .
negative	i ordered my part on 0 / 00 / 00 it is now 0 / 0 / 00 and i will not get my part until 0 / 0 / 00 .
negative	really this is nuts , it should not take 00 days for me to get my product even with standard shipping .
negative	i wanted a reservation for the next_day .
negative	i called on sunday and told the clerk i needed a room for tomorrow .
negative	to my surprise when i looked at the confirmation_email it said i had a reservation for tues , ( not mon .).
negative	when i called back to get it straightened_out i was told there would be a change charge .
negative	($ 0 . 00 ).
negative	i then told them to cancel the entire resv .
negative	as i would not pay to correct a mistake that they made .
negative	i purchase a fender well cover for the left_side of my 00 mustang the first one they sent was to short to reach the front edges of the fender well .
negative	i ordered a new cause they wanted me to pay for shipping to send it back .
negative	the second one came in and once again the same problem apparently the mold is defective .
negative	i ordered an hvac fan for an audi_a0 from parts_geek .
negative	they sent the wrong one .
negative	i couldn_'_t call them or reach them by email for several days .
negative	when i finally did reach them to explain the situation , it took them another 0 days to decide to give me a return_authorization_number .
negative	and of course , i had to pay $_00 to ship it back to them when it definitely wasn_'_t my fault in the first place .
negative	this merchant definitely has a very bad attitude .
negative	i would strongly_recommend everyone steer_clear of these_guys !
negative	- the online ordering system was unable to take payment , hence i was forced to make a particularly expensive call from spain to place my order .
negative	- i was unable to have the large order delivered to the destination of my choice ( and i was charged an_additional £_00 for this ' service ') - meaning i had to pay someone to wait a full day to receive the delivery then take it in their van on five 00 mile_round trips to move to the address required .
negative	- the delivery service was also unable to drop at the assigned point and decided it would be best to leave the tiles in the car_park of a local pub despite the sales_team '_s insistence that the delivery could only be dropped at my home address .
negative	- i wasn_'_t given a delivery slot until 0pm the evening before the due date , despite_repeated calls to confirm .
negative	- after wasting 0 hour queuing unsuccessfully to speak to customer_services i received a return call from a particularly rude supervisor who refused to acknowledge that this might be unacceptable service and certainly would not entaintain any idea of apology or recompense .
negative	truly shocking service .
negative	i would have no_hesitation in recommending that everyone should avoid better_bathrooms in all cases .
negative	i run a small construction company and have never encountered such a poor supplier .

negative	hi ,
negative	i purchased a new iphone 0 on ebay for roughly_$_000 , so i sold my previous iphone 0 that had a cracked_screen , to help lower the difference of my new phone .
negative	they buyer received the item , and eagerly waiting for a positive_feedback , i didn_'_t hear from them until 0 days_later , when they claimed i sent them a nonworking item .
negative	when i fully charged the phone and restored it for him before i shipped it .
negative	for all i know this buyer used my phone for a part , and is finding a way to swindle me .
negative	now i am out $_00 , and a working iphone .
negative	i am very disappointed in paypals seller protection .
negative	i sent paypal pictures of my phone working and charged , 0 days before it sold .
negative	and paypal did nothing to support me .
negative	instead , they granted the buyer his refund , and i am waiting on my phone in the mail .
negative	i am furious knowing that i sent out a working for for $_00 , and now i am out the money , and a working iphone .
negative	especially after all the evidence i provided to show that the phone was in working condition .
negative	thanks paypal .
negative	happy holidays to you too .
negative	wish i had read these reviews prior to ordering from digitlook .
negative	company took my christmas order , charged my credit_card , and than sent me an_email canceling the order a few_days_later .
negative	no_explanation , no customer service - voice_messages unanswered .
negative	am now battling w_/ cc company to reverse charges
negative	stay_away from these scumbags !!!
negative	!
negative	i would never use travelocity for plane reservations again .
negative	there were four segments to our trip .
negative	on two of them , we had to purchase upgrades or wouldn_'_t have had any seat at all .
negative	how can travelocity sell seats that don_'_t exist ?
negative	placed an order on 00th_february , but not delivered yet and no response to tickets , complaints etc .
negative	no phone_number .
negative	the director is a 00 year_old called tony robinson who is also a director of armadillo music technology limited , a ni based company which is currently in the process of being struck off .
negative	order place 0 - 0 and this is 0 - 00 and still no parts .
negative	i won_'_t make this mistake again .
negative	i want to wait_until i get credit for the wrong parts you shipped me and until i see if you provide the correct parts .
negative	i am still_waiting for the product .
negative	its been almost 0 months and the sunglasses are stuck in plenty of burocract stuff .
negative	they say the product is waiting to check the autencity of it .
negative	i couldnt imagine that the company / produdt is suspicious like that to wait so long to enjoy a simple sunglasses .
negative	so , i dont recommend this store .
negative	this company stinks !
negative	when i ordered my parts & waited & waited , i tried to call them .
negative	after 00_minutes , i gave up & sent them an e_-_mail .
negative	they never responded .. even_though they state they would in 00 - 00_hrs !.
negative	after about 00 days my parts finally arrived .
negative	my worst experience ever with an online vendor !
negative	warning .... unless you are looking for a terrible time do not purchase from partsgeek . com .... i never will again !!
negative	!
negative	just installed a rebuilt 0rzfe engine in a 00 toyota_tacoma for my son .
negative	for those of you that need 0 they are hard to find and $ 0000 . 00 plus core_charge .
negative	once complete it would not run properly , we started trouble_shooting to find that 0 of the 0 injectors were badly corroded .
negative	so i ordered replacements from buyautoparts . com .
negative	after installing the engine ran slightly better but still on not all 0 cylinders .
negative	while starting a noid test to see if the injectors are getting the proper fire , on the second injector the engine made a loud knocking sound that concerned the mechanic i was working with .
negative	we pulled the plugs out to see that # 0 plug was drenched in fuel and had not been firing .
negative	the new injector had filled the cylinder with fuel causing hydrolock ( bent cylinder rod ).
negative	after_contacting buyautoparts . com about the defective_part they wanted to speak to the mechanic and they would get back to me shortly .
negative	my mechanic called them then called me back , after 0 hours waiting for buyauto to call me then i finally called them back .
negative	the customer service person was to send a replacement injector at no charge but refuses to give me any assistance in repairing the damaged caused_by the faulty part .
negative	she even stated that the part is probably not bad but i had other issued causing the injector to dump fuel and the same problem would happen with the replacement .
negative	i took the injectors and had them tested to find that 0 were operating properly spraying 00cc '_s of fuel yet the 0th was spraying 00cc '_s which filled the cylinder with fuel and caused this problem .
negative	i then contacted buyautoparts . com again , i sent them paperwork indicating the test results along with a video of the test , i again asked about liability and how they are going to assist me in the additional repairs .
negative	they stated that their warranty does not cover labor replacing a defective_part yet i kept stating i was not looking for labor on the part , i needed parts and labor to repair other issued caused_by the part .
negative	they sent me a copy of the warranty and the last line is " we expressly disclaim liability for incidental and consequential damages caused_by the auto part sold ".
negative	here it is , i '_m screwed !
negative	i with i could expressly disclaim liability in my business and get away with it .
negative	them i realized that this company is a google trusted store so i contacted google for assistance with my issued .
negative	google was able to get me a full_refund of the original cost of my order but they were not able to get buyautoparts . com to take responsibility for the problems they caused me .
negative	now thanks to this faulty part i have to spend another $_000 . 00 in additional parts along with the labor cost to repair a perfectly good engine that has never ran before !
negative	if you like getting_ripped_off , never allowing any sort of communication , having your account suspended when ever they feel_like it .
negative	paying extremely high fees .
negative	forced repayment when it clearly_states in the ebay posting item is " sold as it ".
negative	getting random emails from them saying they have had a " security risk " and your account info may have been stolen but we are not responsible for any thing .
negative	then by all means use this rip_off of a company .
negative	it is as if the support tickets are not even being read by a human_being because they do not listen at all .
negative	i am owed money for 0 phones which i up graded last summer .
negative	0 htc phones and was told i would get £_00 . 00 .
negative	but i never got a penny .
negative	it '_s a shame all of us who were ripped_off can '_t track these ars × holes down and do something about it .
negative	if they are not paying us they should at_least send phones back .
negative	they can be traced by imei numbers .
negative	i am gutted i am sick and unable to work for sometime now due to heart and kidney problems , i needed that money .
negative	you cancelled my whole order because you were out of stock you could have foward the other items i had ordered .
negative	customer service was bad i could never get through i won_'_t be buying any more items from you in the future !
negative	i opened the yellow cartridge and it won_'_t fit into the printer .
negative	you sent the wrong product .
negative	it doesn_'_t even look like the picture of your generic ink for the epson_stylus nx000 .
negative	i have an expedited job to do and cannot print .
negative	placed an order , chased a week_later as nothing had arrived , was told that nothing had been sent as an item was not in stock , was told it would all be out with me the next_day , arrived in 0 different parcels over the following 0 days .
negative	wrote to complain and got no communication back .
negative	which just sums them up .
negative	lack of communication about orders beign out of stock unless you chase and then 0 seperate chases later receive my whole order .
negative	i ordered a water_pump , upper & lower radiator_hoses , serpentine belt and thermostat for a 0000_jeep_grand_cherokee 0 . 0l inline 0cyl .
negative	what i received was the parts for the v0 jeep engine .
negative	i tried to submit a ticket on the mobile site and was unable to because of the security image - it was never correct , so i was unable to submit a ticket .
negative	i had to come home to an actual pc and sit down and do this .
negative	very frustrating .
negative	i was also on hold for 00_minutes , then this nice lady came on the line and hung_up on me ... again , very frustrating .
negative	because of the warehouse setups and shipping_costs , i spent over an_hour getting the parts located at different_warehouses so i could save a little on shipping .
negative	i triple checked the order and it was 000_% correct on my end .
negative	it still didn_'_t matter .
negative	the tracking_numbers were incorrect as well as the number of packages being shipped .
negative	my items were smashed into a box and the wiper_blades and filters i received looked pretty bad and beat up .
negative	i guess a different size box was not available ???
negative	even if i wanted to , i couldn_'_t return them to a retail_store , that '_s how beat up everything was .
negative	i was hoping to save a few $$ by using partsgeek , but it '_s turned_out to be a nightmare .
negative	not only is the jeep not fixed ( i started on it yesterday and found the parts were incorrect ) we are expecting a huge snow_storm and this is my only 0x0 transportation .
negative	because of delayed shipping and incorrect parts , i may not have transportation .
negative	it '_s zero degrees out ( 00 yesterday when i was hoping to fix it ) and getting colder .
negative	it '_s too cold for the gasket material to set_up , so i '_ll have to pay to have it done in a garage if i can find one available ... awesomeness .
negative	probably not using them again .
negative	i would like to give more stars , but since i '_m unable to actually speak to anyone one star it is .
negative	rockauto . com never treated me like this .
negative	rock_auto is cheaper ... my mistake
negative	ho_fatto un acquisto in data 00 luglio per circa 00 , 00 euro .

negative	received part broken in two spots .
negative	the part was packed in a box four times too large with not one foam peanut packing_material , not one .
negative	part was plastic and fragile ended_up breaking .
negative	needed to put my truck together , daily driver .
negative	i spent two hours plastic welding the part back together .
negative	your return_policy sucks , i have to pay for shipping back and reorder , stupid .
negative	no matter what ill lose money returning the broken part .
negative	that '_s it for me and partsgeek , back to rock_auto .
negative	they sent the order late on top of it being the wrong part on top of giving me the run around trying to return the wrong part ... i still have the wrong part and am waiting for a reply from the return dept !
negative	do not order from thiswebsite
negative	having pre ordered mass_effect 0 it was supposedly sent 00 days ago and i have still not recieved it .
negative	i had been told on the phone that i could report it missing on the 00 / 00 / 0000 but i have just tried only to find that they are closed on saturday .
negative	but after our last rating of shop to net and considering i am a silver member and having spent £_000 . 00 in orders the emailed me saying
negative	most probably royal_mail had some delay with your item that is not our fault really ...
negative	i would suggest that you cancel all pre orders with us because in the future royal_mail could make the same mistake .. they are not really 000_% perfect .. wich sounds to me like a big f u .
negative	since this has happened i have cancelled all my pre orders as i can no_longer trust that i will recieve my games on the release_date and as i am a online gamer i need all my games on the release_date .
negative	and if shop to net do not respond i will post everything that has happened on my facebook account and my xbox account so all my gamer friends and more can see how helpfull and trustworthy shop to net really are however if the problem is resolved then i will take no further action .
negative	parts received were different then parts shown in picture at time of ordering , parts also did not fit and had to be jimmy - rigged to work so i didn_'_t have to reorder .
negative	i wouldn_'_t recommend buying anything from partsgeek
negative	slow customer service , unhelpful , rude , and immature operators .
negative	not able to help a lick .
negative	would not recommend to anyone_else .
negative	i ordered my math book the first week of school and the book was supposed to be sent in 0 to 0 business days , so i assumed since i had ordered it in the middle of the week i would recieve the book the next week , or the week after that .
negative	when i didn_'_t receive my book by the third week , i looked up my order with the tracking_number .
negative	it said my order had been cancelled .
negative	i then contacted boobyte customer service to find out why it was cancelled , and why i had not been notified .
negative	they told me that when i ordered the book they were out of stock ( which is not what the website said ) and they stated that an_email should have been sent automatically ...
negative	i then searched all my mail box '_s to the account i gave them and there was no email , i even checked the spam and junk_mail box '_s and searched for their name in the search box , nothing .
negative	so almost a month into the class i '_m stuck with three_weeks worth of math homework to catch up on with no book .... don_'_t rely_on bookbyte .
negative	this represents the start of my endeavor to present an issue to the public relating to money handling by peopleperhour , which is the result of several days of correspondence .
negative	i think it is incredibly important that potential_customers are made aware of what is going on at peopleperhour , and i will therefore avoid any conjecture , or emotive language , which might suggest that this is merely sour grapes over a dispute .
negative	these are the basic facts which are probably self_explanatory , and i will be happy to further discuss my interpretations or provide evidence from correspondence if required .
negative	0 .
negative	in early 0000 i sought a developer to undertake a small software contract , via peopleperhour and accordingly paid the agreed cost to peopleperhour , to be held in escrow .
negative	0 .
negative	the developer did not in the end undertake the job , did not claim his money and the money i had paid into escrow was refunded into something they call a " pph wallet "
negative	0 .
negative	it was fortunately a relatively_small_amount of money , as i decided to leave it where it was on the basis that at some point i would probably want help with another small project .
negative	as it happens that did not transpire until this week , some 00 months later .
negative	0 .
negative	i duly logged in to my peopleperhour account to discover that that over 00_% of the money was gone .
negative	i assumed that there was a reasonable admin explanation for this and queried it with peopleperhour .
negative	this is where it starts to get interesting and in some respects difficult to believe but , as i say , i have detailed correspondence .
negative	0 .
negative	they wrote and admitted they they had taken it .
negative	apparently they have been helping themselves to the equivalent of $ 0 . 00 plus_tax every month for quite some time .
negative	0 .
negative	i asked where , in the notification that the money was going into this " wallet ", did it state that they would help themselves to my money ?
negative	0 .
negative	i asked where and when was i notified on each_occasion that they helped themselves to my money ?
negative	0 .
negative	they wrote and told me that it is apparently in the small_print of their t & c '_s which i had clicked on to agree when i first ever registered with them .
negative	0 .
negative	i responded by stating a : that i had no reason to have expected that i would end up with a plus balance in my account , and b : why would i go and check the small_print of the t & c '_s at the time of the " refund " unless i suspected that they might start to help themselves to my money .
negative	00 .
negative	i '_ll cut through the various correspondence until they started to tell me that it was my fault because i could have withdrawn the money from my wallet before this mysterious 0 month period expired .
negative	then it gets even more interesting - keep that last paragraph 00 in mind .
negative	00 .
negative	on closer investigation i discovered the existence of a message sitting on my account from pph , from the time that the money was refunded into the " wallet " stating categorically that " the credit cannot be withdrawn and can only be used against future business through pph and , more_importantly , that it does not expire !".
negative	furthermore , there is a warning placed against the remaining money on the account stating explicitly that " it is not available for withdrawal "
negative	00 .
negative	further correspondence has taken place in which pph have refused to accept any responsibility , despite having lied to me about the ability to withdraw the money , and they are even now presumably lining up to help themselves to the last remaining funds in my account .
negative	in conclusion_:
negative	pph never took any steps to warn me that they would begin taking money from my account .
negative	they never informed me when they actually did so .
negative	they never advised me to withdraw the money from the " wallet " - in fact they expressly noted on my account that i could not withdraw it .
negative	they have then , incredibly , lied about it in the hope that i would drop the issue and go away .
negative	my concern for other potential users of pph , is not so much that they might fall foul of poor quality or inept customer service .
negative	it is very much that users should understand that there is a fundamental policy within pph to grant themselves the right to help themselves to money which is left with them on trust , to which the user has no right or facility to withdraw the money themselves .
negative	i am happy to discuss the detail and implications of this case , but please please be aware that , as unbelievable as it may sound , removing money from users accounts is very real and exactly_what this company peopleperhour are up to .
negative	i have only lost £ 00gbp , but business is transacted through these_people at much higher levels .
negative	it is my goal to try and spread the word so that as many potential_customers as possible can understand the risk that they will be taking .
negative	be aware and be safe .
negative	david oldridge
negative	very very poor poeples skills . very bad .
negative	ordered a gas_cap and was told they first had to approve payment .
negative	then received message advising that the order could not be canceled for any reason .
negative	went a few_days and received another e_-_mail advising that my payment was being refunded no_explanation provided .
negative	several days since the last e_-_mail and no refund .
negative	would have been nice to know why they couldn_'_t fill my order , maybe there was a legitimate reason they couldn_'_t fill the order but no one took the time to explain .
negative	ordered from a different place and received it promptly several dollars cheaper and the same cap .
negative	wrong parts - very disapointed - i need a phone # so i can talk to a live_person - your site says now i need to pay for your error , thats dead wrong !!!

negative	order has not arrived
negative	i received my order ( replacement_mirror ) broken and unusable .
negative	there was no contact info on the shipping bill so i had to try to find them on the internet .
negative	once i found them i discovered that there is no easy way to reach them .
negative	i tried_calling but was routed to a 0rd_party with a long wait so i tried to email them and am still_waiting for a reply after 00_hrs .
negative	i went to the local_auto_parts store and ordered it from them .
negative	i will have it tomorrow but it looks_like i am out the money i sent partsgeek .
negative	never again .
negative	not sure if they are real .
negative	took the money and never recieved the part .

negative	they were both the wrong parts for the car .
negative	i would like to return both parts for credit .
negative	ron wallace
negative	i bought wiper_blades from their website .
negative	they did not ship the wiper_blades .
negative	i contacted their customer service .
negative	however , they never replied .
negative	they cancelled the order without notifying_me .
negative	the good point is that they cancelled the credit_card payment as well .
negative	first of all we were waiting 00_minutes at the airport to drop_off the car .
negative	fair enough , i hadn_'_t given them my mobile number but it turned_out they were looking for the wrong car .
negative	i had changed my vehicle but i had informed stress_free and had the confirmation e_-_mail with me .
negative	on return i rang them as instructed and was directed to the top of a multi storey car_park where there was nobody about .
negative	we waited over 0 minutes and i was about to ring them again when the car appeared .
negative	the driver got out , thrust a car_park ticket in my hand , said if i was quick i wouldn_'_t have to pay or it would be 0 quid .
negative	i informed him i had already paid my parking charges and it was their responsibility .
negative	he replied ," not of me good luck ."
negative	i loaded my bags with a bit of help from the driver and then he left .
negative	he didn_'_t wait for me to inspect my car , which by the way was filthy .
negative	i had to pay the £ 0 to leave the car_park , i would have had to have been a formula 0 driver to not have paid .
negative	i have used stress_free parking in the past but i will not be doing so in the future and i would never recommend them .
negative	this company will not last long .
negative	i purchased two items off of them and only got one of them .
negative	instead of making it right with me they just give me a line of bs .
negative	they said it will take up to 00 days to salve the problem .
negative	if i needed in sooner to pay for another one , i '_m not going to do that .
negative	this is the worst merchandise / purchase i ever made .
negative	i ordered a pair of ray_ban prescription_sunglasses about three_weeks_ago from smartbuyglasses . com , it took them that long to complete my order .
negative	so guess what ?
negative	the 00 day return_policy that they have is no good because they take over 00 days to send the order .
negative	when i finally got my order the shades were in separate plastic_bags .
negative	so i '_m thinking there has to be an instruction_manual on how to attach my shades to my prescription_glasses , but there wasn_'_t .
negative	so i sent them an_email_asking for instructions and this is there original email response :
negative	" dear kj , thank_you for your email to smartbuyglasses , my name is <_name removed_> and i am pleased to be of assistance today .
negative	we are happy to hear you '_ve received your item .
negative	i regret to inform you we do not have the instructions for this .
negative	if you can not do it yourself , please ask your local_optician to assist you , normally it is free of charge .
negative	please do not_hesitate to contact us in the future with any questions , comments or concerns that you may have .
negative	thank_you again for your support of smartbuyglasses !
negative	best regards ,< name removed_> customer_support_team , smartbuyglasses ".
negative	are you serious ?
negative	what the hell am i suppose to do with unattached shades ?
negative	glue them on or use duck tape !!
negative	it doesn_'_t end there .
negative	so when i ask for a full_refund of $_000 they refer me to there refund policy which says i can '_t exchange prescription_glasses , but if they weren_'_t prescription i had 0 days to ship the item back to hong_kong , at my expense , and exchange them for something else if they arrived in good condition .
negative	it took them seven_days for the item to reach me from china , so if you spend one day waiting for an_email response from some <_name removed_> then you '_ve already lost .
negative	buying prescription_sunglasses from smartbuyglasses is not only stupid but insane .
negative	i should '_ve invested my money here in the united_states at my local_optometrist .
negative	as a consumer and u . s . veteran i am insulted at the unethical practices of chinese businesses on hard working americans .
negative	i will be creating a website soon that show the pics of of my purchase , email conversations , and my experience with smartbuyglasses .
negative	stay_tuned .
negative	booking a trip from boston to san_francisco , i entered 00 march for departure date instead of 00 april way back in november and realized my mistake a few_days_later .
negative	after several phone_calls to travelocity and spending hours on the phone and being transferred from one to the other , all they could do was get me a $_000 refund on 000_dollars worth of tickets ....
negative	i expected better as a regular user of travelocity
negative	i had a need for an odd_size filter , this company offers a variety of odd sizes .
negative	in order to make up my size they toof 0 standard length filters and basically cut the edge off of one to make the correct size width .
negative	the added a card board strip in secure the two together .
negative	it didn_'_t work .
negative	couple that with the filter being sent in a too large box that was crushed in transit .
negative	the result a filter that had no rigidity , would have got sucked right in to the intake .
negative	on a positive note they were quick to refund my money with a picture of the defective filter .
negative	paid 00 $ to ship four small parts , 0 came in 0 days in placing order by ups weighing less_than 0 . 0 lbs .
negative	the other 0 we had to inquire ( a week after_placing order ) as to where the parts were .
negative	received email they were being sent by usps .
negative	those parts weighed 0 ounces .
negative	needless to say , future parts ordered will be placed elsewhere !!
negative	!
negative	i '_ve typed several_times the gift_card code sent to my email on itunes but the following message continues appearing : " the gift_certificate or prepaid_card code you entered has not been properly activated .
negative	please contact itunes customer_support for assistance at ..."
negative	i don_'_t know what to do ...
negative	feels_like i '_ve wasted money here
negative	product damaged .
negative	i had to removed a part from the old unit to fix inside the new unit .
negative	packaging need to be much_better to protect fragile parts .
negative	buying parts there is ok , but " stay_away " from the service department .
negative	seems the average walking the street atv riders is smarter than their mechanics .
negative	i cannot beleive the crap i went through with these_people .
negative	i especially loved the two hour waits , while they search for my keys when i came to pick_up my machine .
negative	and to think i paid for this special service and treatment in the form of an extended_warranty .
negative	big mistake !
negative	this is a generic motor for a window .
negative	there is a right and a left_hand motor for a window .
negative	the rear_tail_gate motor tis one hand you sent the wrong one .
negative	i order a rear tialgate motor the hand is not right but it is the proper motor .
negative	i thought this seemed like a good deal and it was until i got my clubs back .
negative	i used my own case and it arrived with the handle broken off .
negative	i emailed ship_sticks but never received a reply .
negative	obviously they don_'_t stand_behind their service .
negative	i ordered items on a weds that i needed by sat .
negative	there were multiple shipping choices .
negative	it was before_noon , so i chose 0 - day shipping .
negative	i didn_'_t receive a confirmation of shipping until 00_hours_later and noted that goods would not arrive until mon .
negative	i called customer service who basically said that " technically we are right and you are wrong ."
negative	not good choice of words in that situation .
negative	i wanted to cancel order , but they said too bad that goods already on the way and can '_t stop the fedex machine .
negative	i looked at how to return goods , but those needed a form to be attached else they would not refund all money .
negative	since items are gong to a third_party '_s address , that one won_'_t work either .
negative	overall , a bad_experience in trying to order with respect to a timeline , in having order filled and shipped in timely_fashion , and in getting help from customer service to find a solution .
negative	i won_'_t do_business with this firm ever again .

negative	i ordered a deluxe 00 $ dollar flower_arrangement to be delivered to my wife for valentines_day .
negative	when i got home to see the flowers they were half dead and not even close to the same arrangement i ordered .
negative	never the less i was embarrassed and humiliated .
negative	i called to complain and they hung_up on me .
negative	so please do yourself a favor and never waste your money on ava '_s flowers
negative	i will never order again if they dont respond to my complaint .
negative	in fact i '_ll advise everyone that i know .
negative	order anything from partsgeek ever again .
negative	horrible customer service as it relates to answering the phones .
negative	great concept , horrible company .
negative	what you need to know :
negative	the quotes are not " free " in as much as you have to pay to act on them .
negative	shiply calls it a " deposit " but it '_s actually a non_- returnable fee for getting the contact details of the shipping company .
negative	if for whatever_reason the shipping company is unable to fulfil , shiply keep your money , no ifs no buts .
negative	in my case i never_heard from the shipping company , they didn_'_t contact me to complete and they never replied to emails , and shiply kept my money and were dismissive in the process .
negative	i think that breaches uk consumer_protection laws and have reported them to trading_standards .
negative	i have seen lots of other people with similar complaints who have had to try and recover their money from their credit_card or paypal .
negative	i think when the service works it '_s great , but if something_goes_wrong you are screwed .
negative	i bought tablet pipo m0 pro 00gb .
negative	delivery was ok , although the vat tax in netherlands was not counted in so i had to pay that extra ( 00 eur ) when it went through customs in netherlands .
negative	i ordered a case but it had opening for camera on the wrong side .
negative	i cannot verify specification of the tablet but it barely seems to have the advertised properties .
negative	the display quality is good but the system is sluggish ( slower_than my smartphone ), waiting for opening apps too often for too_long unless they are already in memory .
negative	still trying to figure_out batery life but so_far it isn_'_t very good .
negative	orientation of camera in skype is mixed - not rotating properly , always upside_down unless rotation is turned on and in horizontal position .
negative	camera quality is poor .
negative	once the device got stuck while opening the google play market . completely unresponsive and no combination of any keys helped .
negative	i had to wait_until batery died out and then turned it on .
negative	i requested a return or compensation for bad quality device but so_far no response .
negative	i do not recommend buying from them .
negative	rather pay a bit extra somewhere_else .
negative	i think it is chinese company ( although in usa ) and their customer service is very poor once the stuff is sold .
negative	could not get my part did not let_me know for about two_weeks
negative	the company i work for needed to get some things through paypal and i attached their bank_account and credit_card to my account so they could take_care of some things .
negative	the very next_day my account was limited .
negative	they immediately associated my account with a paypal_account i had 0 years_ago with a negative balance .
negative	because of this , the business is now unable to have their own paypal_account because their bank and card is attached to mine .
negative	after_speaking with liz who '_s paypal badge number is 000000 she told me in a recorded conversation that there is no - one at paypal who would be willing to take action and remove the business information so they can have their own account .
negative	even_though their information was on my personal account .
negative	they would not let them take their own bank_account and credit_card off my account .
negative	in short , paypal limited an account after it had been opened for over a year immediately after this business had their information attached to the account .
negative	they immediately found a reason to go after a person by taking_advantage of a company .
negative	they could have limited this account any time within a 00 month period but they suddenly choose to limit it today ?
negative	needless to say , i paid my balance and removed the limitation but only because the company needed to have their bank and card back so they could create their own paypal_account .
negative	paypal uses other people '_s money to their advantage , they can limit accounts on the fly , and they do what they want with their users .
negative	paypal is an unsafe system for the business_owner to utilize in the terms of they have full control , you do not *
negative	unfortunately their are not that many alternatives to paypal on the market today which paypal uses to their advantage .
negative	they make interest on their account balances and they make a lot of money .
negative	it '_s like they ' re greedy enough to make others suffer .
negative	bravo right , i say this is a poor business_practice and the company needs to think about the way they do_business with their users .
negative	i also think ebay needs to think about using another alternative to paypal .
negative	it '_s up to you what you want to use , but frankly i ' d rather work with a company that works with me like payza , escrow . com , and moneybookers or skrill .
negative	the fact that i take the time to review this experience should be enough for you to not use their selfish and greedy service .
negative	i was also told by liz that i could get a copy of the call since " they record all their calls ".
negative	once i got to the right department , they said i needed to call their legal number at 000 - 000 - 0000 and i ' d have to subpoena to get the call .
negative	my guess is they will destroy the evidence now and say no such call happened .
negative	god the whole company upsets me and what '_s hard is you can '_t get mad at their reps , they are just doing their job which the beast has trained them to do .
negative	i hope this helped some of you make the right decision .
negative	i ordered my part from partsgeek because it was in stock and it seemed as though i would receive it in a couple of days .
negative	i ordered the part on a saturday and i know that it wouldn_'_t ship out until monday .
negative	i did not receive my part until a week_later because the shipper had the wrong zip_code .
negative	i didn_'_t like the fact that i couldn_'_t call them and speak with an agent as what the problem was and how it could get resolved .
negative	on top of that they gave_me a ups_tracking code on a fedex website .
negative	i will not be ordering parts from them again .
negative	beware - looks_like these_guys may sell defective parts .
negative	no exchanges in such cases - you pay for return shipping minus a 00_% restocking_fee , and then have to reorder and again pay for their high shipping .
negative	customer service is limited to take a ticket online , and wait for a proper response .
negative	i '_m still_waiting ...
negative	i plan to open up a case with bbb on his unacceptable practice on defective parts .
negative	reeks of a scam to me .
negative	their product selection is great but their customer service is unreliable and difficult to work with .
negative	i have had no_problems with this firm after years of buying until i met the delivery driver from hell slamming my door shut and telling_me to [ f ] off , i have contacted bosses at 0000r . p . m but they have not returned my calls and seem to be standing with him , i will never be shopping there again until i have at_least had an explanation re drivers behaviour now i get a response a week_later , but 0 hour after my review , but they say driver does not work for them but delivers their goods , people beware of this company who supports and lets complete strangers call at your door without_any kind of checks on them and give you any abuse because they will say he dosnt work for us [ watch this driver on [_link ] soon ] and you judge ,.
negative	i , connelly
negative	i wont order from you again .
negative	i bought two head lights for a car over a week_ago and have not even received them yet .
negative	i have followed the tracking_number and it looks as if partsgeek was the hold up .
negative	not good for business .

negative	my wife and i booked a honeymoon and used viator for tickets to the uffizi gallery .
negative	the listing clearly_states that we purchased tickets , and not a tour or group .
negative	upon_arriving at the designated site at the designated time , we were " greeted " by a very rude , very unhelpful representative who looked at our receipt and said that our " tour " had left .
negative	" we didn_'_t purchase a tour ."
negative	i explained , " but rather tickets to skip the line ."
negative	she quickly stated that we purchased a tour and turned away from me and ignored me questions .
negative	i contacted viator '_s customer care , and although the representative on the phone admitted the mistake by viator , the online representative did not stand by their product , or the representative and refused our refund .
negative	viator did not provide us with services or merchandise as paid for , and was very unhelpful .
negative	do not purchase anything from this company .
negative	they had the best price for a steering box for my 0000_pontiac catalina .
negative	i ordered it , with a 00 . 00 core_charge .
negative	o . k i got the new box and follow there directions to send the box back in their box so they could resale the box .
negative	it cost me 00 . 00 dollars to send it back .
negative	ok .
negative	i put the new box on and leak just as bad as my original one !
negative	did the support_ticket to send the bad part back , and want me pay the shipping to return the bad part !
negative	now im out 00 . 00 dollars and i have no core when i try to buy it somewhere_else .
negative	i '_ll keep there bad box for a core .
negative	don_'_t deal with this company .
negative	it '_s a gamble , sometimes you '_ll be ok , sometimes not .
negative	when i paid for sniper elite i expected to be able to play it on the day of release , i thought wrong despite their assurance .
negative	a game being out of stock due to unexpected high_demand is somewhat out of their control and is understandable .
negative	however , to be continually lied to and being told " tomorrow ", " full re - stock monday " and then not receiving your cd_key is beyond frustrating .
negative	they lie to you so you don_'_t get a refund and go elsewhere , had i have known how long it would of taken , i would of just got it somewhere_else .
negative	edit to their reply : ok then , so you get them " fully restocked " - and then what , i '_m supposed to guess my cd_key ?

negative	ordered two_pairs of tickets for depeche mode this weekend in paris , first pair arrived no problem , although they were ordered second .
negative	second_pair still not delivered today ( friday ) because they have gone via germany with ups .
negative	that '_s not viagogo '_s fault , that '_s just crap courier companies , they ' re all the same .
negative	it would seem that my tickets have been " out for delivery " for three_days , in my experience ( we ship via couriers around the world everyday ) that means trouble , so start preparing contingencies .
negative	as a result of evidently bad information , i spent the whole of yesterday unable to leave my farm just in case ups turned_up , it looks_like i '_ll have to do the same today .
negative	my big issue , is with the very rude hannah , who was only interested in talking over me , whilst i was trying to discover how the " when it all goes_wrong " process works .
negative	all she wanted to do was claim ( for the sake of the recorded conversation ) that i was yelling ( i absolutely was not ) at her , stonewalling and refusing to answer_questions .
negative	she preferred to tell me that we were just going around in circles , and that we ' d spent 00_minutes talking_about the same subject .
negative	when i asked her name , i got a big huffy sigh and a grunted name , not really what i expect , but then the conversation was recorded and she probably wasn_'_t really happy about telling_me her name .
negative	yes hannah , because you weren_'_t listening to me and as a result you weren_'_t answering my questions .
negative	which in the end was just about the time frames involved between viagogo acknowledging that there is a problem , and actually doing something about it , through to then getting someone with e_- tickets to upload them and for me to then get an_email from which to be able to download them .
negative	i need to leave here at 0pm tomorrow ( it '_s a saturday tomorrow ), which right now looks_like more than 00_hours , but experience tells_me that it '_s only two or three real working hours , and in france that '_s no time at all .
negative	as a quick lesson in manners , viagogo should teach its employees the word " sorry ", it goes a long way towards making people feel_like you actually give a toss .
negative	for hannah , try listening to what the customer is asking you , it saves time , prevents the customers getting irritated , stops you from claiming they ' re yelling ( when they ' re not , they ' re just getting irritated with your attitude ), and in the end allows the customer to quickly get the information they are after , with the possibility that they might use viagogo again .
negative	hannah , you might only be worried_about going home at 0pm this evening , but i '_m very worried_about having a ruined weekend , with 000 € of hotel booked and paid for , paying someone to look after my farm for the weekend , a wasted_journey to paris and a generally not fun time .
negative	the test of any company is not how they act when all goes_smoothly , but what they do when it starts to go_wrong .
negative	i '_ve also sent an_email with no response .
negative	paid on 00 / 00 , order : #_00000 to unlock a 0s .
negative	status shows " processing ".
negative	if there is a problem a response to email request would be appreciated .
negative	if you are unable to fulfill order a refund would be due .
negative	did not receive my items from a seller , pay_pal would not refund the money .
negative	they said the seller provided a shipping / tracking_# only half the order was in this box .
negative	pay_pal sucks
negative	0 / 0 / 0000 - what an_absolute joke !
negative	received yet more texts informing_me that items would be delivered , and yet again no delivery was made .
negative	i contacted the company to cancel my order and they informed me that ukmail had tried to deliver several_times to my home .
negative	what complete and utter tosh !
negative	!
negative	received 0 emails on three consecutive_days informing_me that my parcel would be delivered .
negative	each day , no one arrived and still , after 0 days no parcel delivered .
negative	despite_repeated_emails to uk mail , i have not even the courtesy of an acknowledgement , let_alone a reply
negative	who ever runs this firm , should be fired for gross incompetence !

negative	i was under the impression this was a reservation , not a advance payment .
negative	i was very disappointed and will not be booking with this hotel or with this service again .
negative	i was using my reservation for co - workers and wasn_'_t paying for the rooms , simy wanted to reserve 0 rooms .
negative	the quality of the merchandise is good but once this company have your money they are no_longer interested in you .
negative	purchasd from them .
negative	they say they have sent out the item .
negative	i now have to wait 00 days to get my money back .
negative	what a waste of my time and money .
negative	slowest and the most expensive delivery i '_ve ever had .
negative	supposedly nj company with warehouses in california .
negative	first time purchase from this company .
negative	it was a birthday_present - a game to be released on the same day .
negative	ordered it well in advance .
negative	did it arrive on time - no .
negative	delivery is by royal_mail but there was no tracking_number issued .
negative	cheap skates shopto didnot have recorded delivery so no tracking_number was issued .
negative	plenty of info on shopto web_site on what to do if a parcel is not delivered but none of it helps .
negative	they suggest waiting a few_days before reporting and waiting 00 days before its reported as a missing item .
negative	i wonder_if we can postpone that birthday ?
negative	received the wrong part , still_haven_'_t recieved a return for it .
negative	re - ordered the part and again got the wrong part .
negative	all communication is via_e_-_mail , you would think at this point someone would call you .
negative	they do require a phone no .
negative	when you order .
negative	after a month of emails i received a key to a version that is not even what i wanted so i can sum it up as the worst purchase ever !
negative	i ordered some sweatshirts , all of which arrived very promptly ( thank_you !)
negative	and which and the usual hallmarks of superdry_clothing - stylish and high - quality .
negative	the one thing you '_ll know is that superdry sizing varies wildly across their styles - i fit a small in the hoodies but a small henley is so tight , it practically cuts off my blood supply .
negative	so i order a couple of sizes , as i would here in the us to make_sure .
negative	i ask for the rma to send the items back , expecting to pay us postage , only to find that ' per the policy on the website ' i have to return the clothes to the us .
negative	trust is everything in sales and i trust a company that markets to the us with a us site has a return_policy that is in line with everyone_else our here .
negative	needless to say , i '_m very disappointed and won_'_t be buying superdry online again .
negative	i suggest you avoid making the same mistake too .
negative	i .
negative	will not ever get another loan don_'_t like the service i found outt rapid cash is much_better and i will pay this loan off and close this acct don_'_t like the constant calling to remind you or text_messages this company is not good for any loan find someone_else if you have to use a place like this !!
negative	!
negative	i never got my 00 dollar oil_pressure sender unit that i payed for , the site says it was a successful shipment even_though it wasnt , tried to submit a ticket , but the support page has_been " under maintenance " every time i tried , they stole from me , plain and simple , if there was a shipping error then my order should not have shown up as a success when i followed with the tracking_number , and they should have sent an_email , call , text , or one of the other 000 ways of contacting a person these days if there was an issue .

negative	the inkfarm price was excellent so a ordered a package of ink refill ; unfortunately when i replaced the ink in my epson it rejected them advising me that it wan an illegal cartridge .
negative	it also sent a message to epson ( since i have a fax line set_up to it ) that by using this ink my printer warranttee would be voided ??
negative	?
negative	totally confusing as to kind of gift_card and notes .
negative	hidden and confusing fees .
negative	what the heck is a direct card anyway ?
negative	numerical fields default to alpha , capital letters to lower case .
negative	really , does my credit_card begin with alpha ?
negative	if i live on oak street does street begin with lower case ?
negative	bank info ?
negative	never before for a credit_card .
negative	and if i miss a field it erases the cc_info .
negative	we were one click away from giving up .
negative	you should send your it people to work with obamacare !
negative	the sensor was not as pictured .
negative	pic shows a wiring connection , which would have been great .
negative	instead , no connection , just wires .
negative	and the wrong colors at that !
negative	so we had to guess at the connection .
negative	guess what ?
negative	we guessed wrong , and the problem remains .
negative	now i have to tear into it again , when i get the chance , all the while going through gas like crazy , and try to re - wire it .
negative	this time without the guy_who did it the first time .
negative	thanks a lot .
negative	btw , i have no_idea if the parts are any good or not because they are no working correctly yet .
negative	i made reservation for a compact car with thrifty auto to pick_up a my rental at five pm .
negative	i had to wait_until 0 :_00pm and at that point i had to drive of with a mini_van ....
negative	bought a groupon to take a balloon flight with this company .
negative	i lost_count of how many_times i called and left a message with no return call .
negative	then when i finally talked with someone , there were no weekend dates available in this century .
negative	then when i finally scheduled a date to go , and after i woke_up at 0 :_00am and drove over an_hour to make it to temecula in time for a sunrise flight , i arrived to find out the flight was cancelled due to weather .
negative	strange ...
negative	i saw at_least eight other balloons flying in what could only be described as perfect conditions .
negative	fought with both sunrise balloons and groupon to get a refund , in a frustrating but eventually successful battle .
negative	but did i get refunded for all the time i spent including the trip to and from temecula , or the gas i used ?
negative	nope .
negative	it cost me a lot of time and money to learn what i '_m about to tell you : don_'_t use this company .
negative	got a groupon for a hot air balloon ride with sunrise balloons in temecula .
negative	first off , the deal claimed the value was $_000 and the groupon was for $_00 .
negative	but later i discover that several other_companies in the area - all of which have way higher yelp ratings ( strike one ) - all charge about $_000 to $_000 .
negative	so the " value " was substantially inflated .
negative	strike two .
negative	called the company to try to redeem and no one answered so left a message .
negative	no response after two_days .
negative	strike thee .
negative	called again .
negative	voicemail again .
negative	called again , and again , and again .
negative	strike four , five , etc .
negative	finally got a hold of someone , who helped_me schedule a flight for a date over a month away because none of the many dates i wanted were available .
negative	another strike .
negative	when the fateful date arrives , i wake_up at 0 :_00am and show up at the launch site at 0 - something in the morning after driving over an_hour to temecula , no sunrise balloons .
negative	so i call and - surprise - no answer .
negative	when i finally talk to someone , they say they had to cancel due to weather .
negative	what ?
negative	i saw at_least 0 other balloons floating through the early morning sky on what could only be described as a perfect day .
negative	were they in different weather ?
negative	when i contacted groupon for a refund , they told me that it is the nature of ballooning that sometimes flights cancel due to weather , and i needed to try to reschedule and only if i was not able to reschedule would i get a refund .
negative	what about a refund for the frustration , and the gas i used to drive to temecula ?
negative	groupon needs to do a better job of a ) choosing the companies they work with b ) stating the actual value of the product or service and c ) not ripping people off .
negative	i ordered some items from part geek and some of the parts came as expected , however i also ordered some diesel injectors for $_00 . 00 and i got an_email_saying they refunded my injector order , however the next_day they had the same injector for $_00 !
negative	i believe if this was a stand up company they should have sold me the injectors at the original price .

negative	e na healthdesigns tem alguns cupons de desconto que são especiais e valem para todas as compras , não apenas na primeira .

negative	i will not write this as to a friend but to someone_who oversees these so - called " technicians ."
negative	my name is roy b . and this is in reference to invoice 00000 - 000 and 00000 - 000 for work received at the stratford location on hawley lane .
negative	please read all the way to the end , a good story always comes with a great ending .
negative	i received an online quote for 000 . 00 for the work to be done .
negative	when i arrived , i was told the firestone fr000 000 / 00r00t that i currently had on my car were not in stock .
negative	my original_quote said they were in stock .
negative	i ended_up paying $_00 more per tire for 0 tires .
negative	this was something i overlooked as i felt i would be getting a better quality product .
negative	i received 0 mcraft touring lsr tires , computer balancing , valve_stem , and an alignment for a total of 000 . 00 ( with tax ).
negative	over 000_dollars more than what i had originally figured to spend .
negative	here is where the big problem began .
negative	before i could leave , they let_me know that i have severe rotting and rust on the front crossmember of the car .
negative	one of the guys at the front_desk said that it was not even safe to drive .
negative	i would wonder where the ethics are in the people in this facility but this is not the first time i have encountered or heard of a situation where someone cares more about taking someone '_s money than that person '_s well - being .
negative	i was instructed to get the cross member checked out and not to drive too far on it .
negative	but heck , with 0 new tires and an alignment , i should be able to drive wherever i want !
negative	at_least get my 000_dollars worth .
negative	i '_m not going to do that though , i am very thankful for your technicians telling_me of the issues , but i ( and i was not an eagle scout , nor am i a churchgoer ) would have liked to have been called and told of the major issue regarding the framing being completely worn away before having work started on the car .
negative	again , the guys have mouths to feed right ?
negative	i have an unusable car with brand spankin ' new tires .
negative	i asked you to read all the way to the bottom because there is a great ending .
negative	as i drove very slowly home , i recognized that the $_00 alignment i paid for was done by someone missing a shoe .
negative	my steering_wheel which had been cocked to the left was now " aligned " to be cocked to the right .
negative	thank_you for charging me for work that was not really done .
negative	i will be more than happy to return the tires and take a refund for the " work ."
negative	please feel free to pass this message along to any and all managers that you can .
negative	i would like to be contacted regarding this issue as i will be following up with whoever will listen .
negative	ordered rear caliper rebuild kit .
negative	came with only 0 seals not complete kit .
negative	all that was offered was refund if i shipped back .
negative	would not send missing seals .
negative	waste of my time .
negative	be wary of this supplier !
negative	i ordered parts from this company on a few occasions , and have been_disappointed with their service .
negative	the first experience was with a valve_cover gasket which was part of a larger order , i received notification of the shipment and proceeded to take the vehicle apart , upon_receipt of the order there was no valve_cover gasket in the shipment , and no information as to the future delivery of the item .
negative	now you have to contact them , and find out if they are going to ship at a later date , or call the order complete .
negative	the last time i ordered something , and i mean the last time i will ever order from this incompetent organization , i ordered a air control_valve for a b . m . w ., and what was in the box when it arrived ???...
negative	a serpentine belt for a mitsubishi ....... all i can say is good luck ordering from these_idiots !!
negative	!
negative	booked a harry_potter walking_tour in london .
negative	viator site showed a 0 pm walk .
negative	it no_longer existed .
negative	had to change entire schedule to attend following_day .
negative	called tour operator at number listed on viator , but no answer .
negative	second booking was for a double decker bus_tour in dublin .
negative	email from viator was very specific - we would use a printed voucher , show our portable device ( iphone ), or just show id to the driver .
negative	nope - had to walk to tour operator office , log_into my own email on their computer , and print the voucher .
negative	will never use vaitor again .
negative	ordered and paid for next_day delivery within the stated time frame .
negative	package finally arrived 0 days_later .
negative	e_mails sent to boohoo were not responded even_though they claim that the reason they have no phone_number is that they believe email is much more effective and efficient .
negative	i finally got a reply after the order ahd been delivered .
negative	the courier , ( dx direct ) informed me when i rang them on friday 00st_december , that my order ( even_though it had been made well before the daily deadline had arrived with them too_late to be despatched the following_day ( thursday 00th_december ).
negative	they then also failed to depatch it on the friday and i was told i would then have to wait_until the following_monday .
negative	i finally spoke to a the complaints department who had the authority to despatch on the saturday_morning 00nd_december .
negative	all i got from boohoo was notification of a refund of the postage on 00rd_december .
negative	possible the most impersonal and unimpressive customer service .
negative	i suggest they review their legendary customer service and resort to one where you actally talk to a real_person .
negative	bought $_00 ukash token yesterday , require ukash 00 digit number for purchase .
negative	please forward number thanks .
negative	no . 000000000
negative	here is the reply from the person we delivered the translation to :
negative	thanks for your help !
negative	could you please have a different person than the one who translates it double - check it ?
negative	we want to make_sure it ’_s letter perfect .
negative	i appreciate your help !
negative	____________
negative	we just received feedback from our client related to the spanish translation that was done for us recently .
negative	they are not happy with the outcome .
negative	they said it did not make_sense and that it looked like someone had just plugged the original document into google translator .
negative	is this person_who did the translation a native spanish speaker ?
negative	if not , can you please re - visit with someone_who is and send us an updated document ?
negative	we have a sizable bilingual client basis and many opportunities ahead of us together but this didn_’ t set a great foot forward with them for either of us .
negative	i purchased a wheel_bearing hub that said it had abs and it did not .
negative	they had made a mistake in there description and they will not reimburse my shipping or pay for the return shipping .
negative	i bought a men '_s thigh length compression garment following my hip revision surgery with removal of a seroma .
negative	the zipper on the garment broke after about two months .
negative	i emailed and called customer service on several_occasions leaving a contact telephone_number and an_email address .
negative	no one ever responded !
negative	i would advise people in need of compression garments to look for other_vendors because once lymphedema_products has your money they don_'_t know you .
negative	i was searching for rental_cars in cairns australia , and autoeurope had the lowest_price , so i went with them .
negative	total was $_000 . 00 for 0 days .
negative	after i submitted my payment , the next page was a confirmation page that gave_me my voucher / confirmation number and the summary : total $_000 . 00 , paid $_000 . 00 , balance due on delivery $ 0 . 00 .
negative	when i got to the airport in cairns , they wanted another $_00 !!!
negative	saying that it was taxes and fess that autoeurope didn_'_t collect .
negative	well , i had no way to call the us and it was like midnight in the us , so no one would have picked_up the phone or anything .
negative	what a scam !!
negative	i '_ve never rented a car online and paid for it in full only to be told at the pick_up location that i owe more especially when it said " balance due on delivery $ 0 . 00 !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
negative	i will never rent from autoeurope again , and will not even visit the website every again .
negative	get your car somewhere_else ...
negative	haven_'_t received the gift_cards that i purchased .
negative	i ordered two parts from partsgeek . com .
negative	the process was seamless and very user_friendly .
negative	i found the parts i needed and confirmed the transaction within minutes .
negative	i was just waiting for delivery .
negative	several days_later i received the delivery as_promised .
negative	problem was that only one part was delivered .
negative	the shipping_label indicated both were in delivered and but correct .
negative	although the ordering_process was a good experience , it was all downhill from there , including dealing_with customer_relations .
negative	this service does not really offer any services .
negative	you get a one time credit_report and do not get monthly updates , unless you upgrade .
negative	they do not provide anything that credit karma does not offer for free .
negative	the service is difficult to cancel - you cannot cancel online , i will have to contact their department and say to cancel at_least 00 times as i listen to many sales_pitches and different pricing offers .
negative	they should offer their best price and best services right off the bat .,
negative	the part does not match picture or application .
negative	can not be used .
negative	took a week to get here after shipping
negative	after_placing my order i was coned into joining a free freight site by parts_geek . i was lured by a promise of ( i think ) 00_% refund of my shipping . after filling_out the requested information ( thinking i would get some money back ) i was informed that i now have to pay 00 . 00 per_month to be a member . this is a very bad practice .
negative	plan and simple a deceitful con job , by parts_geek . wont happen again .
negative	the connection to calls are very poor .
negative	always an error .
negative	this is poor and low , i will use my credit up , and cancel .
negative	and never refer this service to anyone i like .
negative	customer service is bad , they speak really fast as though they want to get you off the phone immediately .
negative	sorry excuse for a company .
negative	how are you still in business ?
negative	i was forced to give it a star , there were no option of no star , or else , i ' d select that .
negative	i orderd some wellington boots and got a confirmation_email with tracking_number , i tried to use the traking number for several days but it did not work .
negative	i eventiually had to ring up and they said that thay had adifferent way of tracking and my parcel had left .
negative	it did arrived eventually .
negative	i would not reccomend and will not use again
negative	stuart smith
negative	shipping was very fast .
negative	after i got the part , i discovered it was not quite what i wanted .
negative	i have requested a return of the part i have not recieved permission to send it back .
negative	iguess i '_m stuck with a part i do not want or need .
negative	i would not put the bug shield on my car .
negative	i guess i '_m out the money i spent for this bug shield .
negative	terry
negative	i loved on it , i pushed it to all my friends and i was a huge_fan .
negative	then my last order was eather old stock or something , the alpha_brain smelt a lot different and made my stomic really upset , ever since i haven_'_t been interested in reordering .
negative	i wish i didn_'_t have this experience because i loved your stuff .
negative	we ordered a part , that was cancelled due to the card having a different address than the shop .
negative	we tried to contact parts_geek to try to get it back out shipped quick but they only gave_us an_email address to contact them , and told us it would take them up to 00_hrs to contact us .
negative	an 000 number would have gotten this problem_solved faster .
negative	get an 000 number !!
negative	!
negative	ordered led kits on tuesday , order arrived half was missing , one week_later and 0 deliveries on and still_waiting for 0 more part , unable to fulfil my order with my client because of this - would not recomend this company - even a telephone_call from someone would have been nice - just email comunication .
negative	use this company at your peril
negative	this has_been one of the worst experiences i '_ve had trying to book a room .
negative	several people i talked to at reservation_counter spoke poor or little english .
negative	it took_awhile before i could get a hold of someone i could understand .
negative	i asked the person helping_me countless_times if he was booking me a room at the days inn at us hwy 0 and interstate 00 .
negative	he assured me it was the correct room .
negative	after being booked and billed $_000 , i checked my confirmation_email and noticed that i was in fact booked in the completely wrong area .
negative	i immediately called back , and requested to change my room to the correct location .
negative	i was told that wasn_'_t possible , and had to book another room and be charged another $_000 .
negative	i will never use reservation_counter again as a booking agency .
negative	shipping was fast .
negative	i ordered a bottle of cleaner and a bottle of protectant .
negative	i opened the box and bottles looked used there was no seal on them , and they had greasy finger prints all over them .
negative	the cleaner was half empty , i made do .
negative	i won_'_t order form this site again ......
negative	orderd my package more than a week_ago and it shipped out right_away but i still_havent recieved it .
negative	fed_ex was suppose to deliver it and its says the post_office is suppose to deliver it .
negative	went to the post_office and no one knows where my package is or they dont even think its there .
negative	horrible experience .
negative	i placed an order on a sunday .
negative	i changed my mind and sent a email the same day within 0 hours to cancel .
negative	i received a email monday_morning that it was already being shipped and it couldn_'_t be stopped .
negative	ridiculous !
negative	i order a mirror from partsgeek need to exchange it never recived info .
negative	about
negative	how to exchange it or any other info . i will not be ordering from partsgeek
negative	again and hope other peoples stay_away .
negative	a delivery arranged for my work address , made months in advance of the delivery , was completely botched .
negative	at great inconvenience to me and my co - workers , disrupting multiple plans , i am forced to work at home tomorrow .
negative	this is something basic that should go right the first time .
negative	since this is my first time using viagogo , i can report a 000_% disappointing experience .
negative	my transaction id is 0000000 .
negative	also worth pointing_out after a fairly fruitless conversation with customer service -- don_'_t call them , they '_ll call you , as all you '_ll get is an_automated phone_number with no " real_person " option -- i got the customer service rep to promise a call back from a manager to explain the cock - up .
negative	no call yet .
negative	i '_m waiting .

negative	ladies , i have posted product code a0s000000 , size 00r , back to you
negative	today asking for your consideration to exchange for the same product
negative	( still in khaki ) in a size 00r .
negative	i noticed this product is back on sale again for £_000 . 00 and you
negative	still show a size 00r available in the khaki .
negative	would you please put aside a size 00r in the khaki for product code
negative	a0s000000 for me and hold it pending arrival of the returned product
negative	for exchange ?
negative	i would hate to miss out on your wonderful product due to a lack of
negative	size availability and wish you and yours " happy holidays !

negative	thanking you in advance for your expeditious attention to this matter , i remain
negative	very truly yours ,
negative	richard d . young
negative	i wrote a letter and explained exactly_what part i needed and they recommended the same wrong part i needed to return .
negative	then they recommended a different part and when i received the second part and it was wrong again .
negative	i sent two letters and no responds .
negative	if receive no help i won_'_t use them again .
negative	order 0_weeks and no answer
negative	i chose partsgeek purely at random .
negative	i looked at several
negative	sites .
negative	all had free shipping & were within a few dollars &
negative	allowed returns .
negative	my mistake .
negative	after receiving the wrong
negative	part from partsgeek i followed there procedure for
negative	returns .
negative	the wrong part sent cost me not only the $_00 . 00
negative	but return shipping & restocking_fee , a total of $_000 . 00 .
negative	went to another parts site .
negative	recieved the correct part with
negative	a 000_% return_policy .
negative	never purchase from partsgeek
negative	again & certainly will inform others as well .
negative	there are better suppliers to buy from .
negative	the parts i received were bad and were previously sent to another customer who returned it for the same problem and then they wanted me to purchase a new part and return the old part at my expense and when they receive the old part they would refund my money on the first part within 00 days ..
negative	anyway i ended_up buying an oem part that worked properly in order to get my customer taking_care of .
negative	i guess thats the advantage of doing_business with a small company where every customer and sale are equally_important unlike the big organizations like parts_geek .
negative	my company will never buy from parts_geek again ....
negative	i ask for a front_license_plate brakes when i opened the box it was broken , never ever ever ordering from this crappy store , what a waste of time and money .
negative	but i '_m sure they are going to tell me to take time and money out of my pocket to return there product .
negative	i hate bad service , thanks for the broken part they sent me !
negative	tok money from my account for 0 months without me knowing , had to get the bank to get it back from them ( successfully ).
negative	buy a video much_cheaper , most of the films on there are old anyway or have been on tv .
negative	they wanted to keep hold of my money for 00 days lol who do they think they are , don_'_t need them i have a credit_card ( which is insured ) loads of horror_stories_about money going missing from these accounts .
negative	and they are owned by ebay lol laughable .
negative	why do i want people to know my business , i have caught so many people on here who have tried to rip my company off its hillarious , you request them as a friend and they accept regardless of who you are .
negative	doomed i reckon .
negative	and staff_members are even funnier they try to throw a sicky but they tell eveyone they are suffering from an hangover on fb lol doh used by dim - wits .
negative	nightmare , from start to finish , the only good thing is the price , however went with easyjet last_year and it was cheaper and the staff were really nice and friendly .
negative	this company is for chavs going on holiday , if you can_afford a little_bit more ( and it is a little_bit after they rob you for missing something on your booking this has happened evrytime i travel with them ).
negative	the flights ae full of smelly dim wits who like to down a few pints of stella before boarding ( at 0 in the morning |).
negative	scutter company for scutters
negative	full of dodgy people trying to rip everyone off , a nightmare on returns , and bad customer service form ebay themselves .
negative	i have deleted my account and started_using gumtree , sold all my stuff in a week to local people face to face no_hassle .
negative	i useed this company for my waste for many_years , i tried to end my contract which is where my nitemare began .
negative	nearly 0 years later ( and now they have been taken over and are still chasing me ), they are still hounding me .
negative	this debt ( which i do not owe them ) is around £_000 , this company is huge they must have spent well over this amount in phone_call and letters .
negative	in addition they actually sent me confirmation my final_bill had been paid , then 0 months later sent me a final demand for the same amount .
negative	you just couldn_'_t make it up , i have had a new company for over a year and have not had to make a single_complaint .
negative	aaaaagh
negative	i was shocked when booking a reservation for a room at hampton_inn in iowa city for october and my credit_card was immediately charged the room fee , taxes and " fees ."
negative	i went to hilton . com and could book the same room / taxes for $ 0 less and my credit_card is not charged until i check into the hotel !!!!!
negative	so i cancelled the room booked thru the reservation_counter service ...
negative	i have never prepaid for a room .
negative	i wont use reservation_counter service again ....
negative	i am more careful to now use the real hotel website !!!
negative	!
negative	i made a purchase for videos on oct 00 that i could have to entertain friends on veterans day weekend .
negative	the holiday has come and gone and i have yet to recieve them .
negative	in addition , according to my credit_card account , i accidentally hit the " pay " button twice so my card has_been charged $_00 . 00 twice .
negative	when i called to inquire i was told that your office only recieved " one payment " and a subsequent order has not been sent due to funds being unavailable .
negative	the interesting thing is all transactions have been taken off my credit_card and i am sitting here with nothing !
negative	whats_going on ?!
negative	!
negative	this place still sucks they won ; t take back the wrong part they sent
negative	i booked a room for the oakbrook / downers grove , illinois area through pricelines bidding system , and they sent me to a hotel in hillside , illinois .
negative	nowhere even close to downers grove .
negative	they take your money and send you anywhere .
negative	despite the fact that the item i was purchasing was listed on the web - site as limited stock , it has still not been delivered - and i even paid for silver deliver ...
negative	the store says there was an error on the web - site that erroneously suggested the item was available - well fix it already , guys !
negative	pathetic excuse for a company , internet or otherwise .
negative	owners and top management are all spineless cowards .
negative	i still have not received part of my order , after several weeks , and there is absolutely no way to speak with anyone at partsgeek about my order .
negative	please , please , please do not , under any circumstances , buy from this company .
negative	by the way , i rated partsgeek as 0_star , only because trustpilot will not let_me submit my review with zero_stars .
negative	partsgeek sucks .
negative	not easy to operate , not happy with service .
negative	fast shipping when you order small .
negative	i just ordered $_000 worth of supplements 00 days ago and still don_'_t have a tracking_number .
negative	between me and my brother we spend at_least $ 0000 a year on supplements and seriously thinking about shopping elsewhere like bodybuilding . com .
negative	i rather spend the extra money and get my stuff on time stress_free .
negative	very disappointed with supplement_warehouse .
negative	i '_ve used priceline for many_years , but i '_m done .
negative	they outsource all customer service ( if you can call it that ) to india , and once you finally get a person on the phone they have no ability whatsoever to help .
negative	i can '_t support that kind of service with my dollars , and will be going elsewhere from now on .
negative	customer service rep seem like she just woke_up .
negative	not helpful .
negative	ordered a part for my vehicle took 0 week for to arrive .
negative	it is disgraceful that a site like this can be used in an attempt to beat up companies that have done nothing wrong and that customers can then use it as a threat because they have made an error purchased a bespoke product which was made to order to match their colour selection options and then once the customer receives it they realise they ordered totally the wrong thing and want to exchange it .
negative	when that customer is very politely informed about the made to order policy ( which they agreed to prior to submitting the order ) and that it is non returnable - but as a goodwill_gesture we will make a replacement to the revised options the customer wants but they will have to cover the delivery cost which the customer rebuffs because they feel the company should incur all the additional_costs .
negative	and then for that customer to be able complain_about the policy ( which they knew about before purchasing ) and the fact they were asked to pay another carriage_charge to enable their own ( the customers ) mistake to be rectified is just simply stupid .
negative	this is then further compounded_by the non logic of trust_pilot because they will not remove it .
negative	depsite the fact the company concerned has done nothing wrong .
negative	the non return ( made to order ) policy was notified before the customer purchased
negative	the customer was spoken to politely at all_stages
negative	the customer was offered a way of replacing as a goodwill_gesture
negative	the customer leaves a one sided review because they feel hard done by that it is going to cost to rectify there mistake .
negative	what more do i need to say ...
negative	when we are 000_% right we will always be wrong when there are sites like this ...
negative	disgraceful
negative	when i was on vacation in london i bought a x00 mini pro handset , i specifically told the salsrep .
negative	that i wanted a phone without simlock , because i live in denmark , and dont have three as my network - provider .
negative	he said it was not locked ...
negative	but when i came to denmark i inserted my own simcard , and it was locked !
negative	i then called three costumerservice ( from my cell in denmark to england ) i called monday , they said 00_hours , i called wednesday , they said 00_hours , i called friday , they said 00_hours .
negative	i called saturday and was then promised a callback later the during day or monday at the latest ... no one called !
negative	i called them yesterday evening ( monday ) and they told me it would cost me 00 pounds to get the code from them !
negative	i was promised otherwise when i bought it , so i was really unhappy with this and said no ...
negative	but okay okay , today i called them because i really want to use my new phone .
negative	i gave the servicerep .
negative	my card details , but there was an error with the payment , so again i was promised a callback whitin 00_minutes , 0 hours_later i called them again , the servicerep .
negative	told me that they could not help me if not my creditcard was registered on a uk adress ?!?
negative	im a dane , living in denmark !!!
negative	he told me that i could make an overseas payment for the 00 pounds ( this will cost me aditional 00 pounds in fee to my bank ) and i already spend nearly 00 pounds calling them for a code that is 00 pounds ...
negative	they a out of their freaking mind .
negative	the worst service i have ever had to deal with !
negative	i would under no circumstances recommend this company or their products to anyone !!!!!!
negative	its a d - in servicelevel and human understandings , cost / benifit , and costumercare !!
negative	!
negative	i have bought tens of games before from several stores , but this is the first time to have this issue .
negative	waiting for a refund , hopefully they wont scam the money out of it
negative	dont deal with this website
negative	once i had placed my order via the internet with parts_geek that was the end of the communications .
negative	i needed to make_changes to my order before it shipped based on info that was sent to me from pg stating that i would be receiving two of the one part i ordered .
negative	they have a phone line that puts you on hold for at_least 00 min '_s then tells you nobody will be answering and to go on line to fill_out a form so they can get back to you when they can .
negative	after several days i get an e_-_mail telling_me to just go_ahead and pay to ship the extra part back and they will take_care of the refund of the product but not the shipping .
negative	as a solution i refused the delivery and my credit_card had to denie the charge to pg , thanks amx and thank_you pg for the outstanding customer service .
negative	i will not be doing_business with a company that does not want to speek with their customers .
negative	mad in az
negative	the only way to contact customer service is through emails .
negative	far too often parts_geek does not respond to their emails .
negative	i have sent three emails , requesting help with an order which was missing parts , over the space of 0 days and i have received no response .
negative	trying to call their phone_number you are put on hold for 00_minutes then sent back to the main menue or cut_off .
negative	unacceptable .
negative	the parts , when they come , are good , but heaven help you if you need to contact someone .
negative	really really bad_experience !
negative	0 day after_placing an order , the order is still in process ! first they had a " computer glitch , then the suply from manufacturer was lost ( even_though the items showed in stock when ordered ), then the price went up with about $ 0 which they charged without even asking i agree to pay .
negative	buy far the worst shopping_experience ! to bad there are no 0_stars , one is to much !
negative	waited three_weeks and still_waiting for a head_gasket_set ..
negative	ordered something else from a different website that you would think it would take at_least a week nope three_days .
negative	they didn_'_t give me a receipt in my email like other_places do , and if you try to call they of course didn_'_t answer the phone .
negative	don_'_t waste your time here .
negative	was very excited to use the site , based on the reasonable prices and customization_options .
negative	paid for faster shipping to ensure card arrived on time .
negative	it did ... great !!!
negative	then i found out the customized picture i chose for the card was not applied .
negative	the recipient was sent a completely white card ... not good !!
negative	if there was a problem with the picture , i ' d like to be contacted .
negative	the result was embarrassing .
negative	lets begin with my original order #_00000 placed on 0 / 00 / 00 .
negative	when received i noticed the box was not the kerdi - shower kit i had 0rdered -( k000 - abs - e ), so i opened the box and removed all the items inside .
negative	there were a number of items missing -
negative	the 0 - inside and 0 - outside corners were not in the box , the kerdi band waterproofing strip was also not in the box as were the kerdi pipe seal and kerdi seal mixing valve seal also missing .
negative	interestingly the additional kerdi 000 / 0m roll was in the box .
negative	0 - 00 - 00
negative	hello , i tried_calling twice yesterday was disconnected once and left on hold for 00_minutes the second time .
negative	i just tried_calling and was asked if i could call back in an_hour and i said absolutely not that i needed to speak to a customer service manager and then was promptly disconnected .
negative	i do not have the time to wait on hold nor the patience to be continually disconnected .
negative	i have tried to call your company numerous_times to no_avail .
negative	you left one message on my cell_phone , there were * no * numerous_attempts to contact me , i tried to return the call from the voicemail left by one of your customer service managers yesterday and as stated_above was disconnected and left on hold for over 00_minutes , i do not have the time to chase you guys down .
negative	the original order #_00000 was picked_up by ups today .
negative	it really doesn_'_t matter to me that you ship schluter products daily , this does not make you experts at making_sure the order is complete as shown by both orders being incomplete .
negative	i have my cell_phone with me 00 / 0 so have a customer service manager call me asap .
negative	0 - 0 - 00
negative	okay ,
negative	it is now 0 days since sending the email below and absolutely no contact from anyone at e_comfort .
negative	this is really sad customer service , i have done everything i can do to reach your customer service department , to no_avail .
negative	i feel that the ball is now in your court , if i do not hear_anything freom a customer service manager first thing monday , please send me a return_label for the second incorrect shipment so that i may get my money back and place my order elsewhere .
negative	regards ,
negative	mike labelle
negative	i called and talked to biannca on 0 / 00 / 00 and explained what had happened and she said a new complete order would be shipped out .
negative	i received the new order today 0 / 00 / 00 and to my surprise there were even more items missing in this box than in the previous box .
negative	i am at a loss to understand how your company can screw up a simple order so badly , not once but twice .
negative	the replacement order #_00000 was missing all the inside and out side corners , the pipe seal , the mixing valve seal , the additional roll of kerdi 000 / 0m .
negative	it amazes_me at this pint that your company is this inept in the order department to not be able to put_together a simple order .
negative	they sent me the wrong part over a week_ago but still have not sent an_rma .
negative	they do not reply with in the 00 - 00 hour period .
negative	i have been waiting all week for my rma and nothing .
negative	when you try and call even to purchase a part they say go to the website after waiting 0 minutes .
negative	autohausaz . com always answers their phone ..... never an issue with them .
negative	when know better you '_ll do better .
negative	never again parts_geek .... should have read the reviews first .
negative	i will be going to the better business_bureau to resolve this issue .
negative	they need to be reported .
negative	the parts took way longer_than promised date .
negative	will not shop_here again .
negative	tldr ;
negative	slow service with no communication .
negative	claim remains unresolved after 0_weeks despite continuous chasing .
negative	had to involve seller ( lee longlands ).
negative	still seeking refund so i can find alternative " insurance "
negative	i recently made a claim on through this service .
negative	i initially had trouble placing a claim , despite advertising a 00 hour claims line .
negative	we were unable to place a claim outside of 0 :_00am - 00 : 00 ( or something similar ).
negative	the several people we ' d spoken to assured us our calls would be returned , though they never were .
negative	after a few_days of failed_attempts to place a claim i made a call within my normal working hours .
negative	i was told nothing was logged regarding my previous calls .
negative	the person_who came to clean our sofa cushion cover could not resolve the issue and took the cover to be cleaned .
negative	at this point we didn_'_t hear_anything further for a week , so we chased our claim and were told we would be given a call back regarding progress .
negative	no call was given and i again chased this up the following_day .
negative	i was told the covers were being returned and should be with us within a few_days .
negative	a further week passed with no further news of our cover so i chased staingard yet again .
negative	no further information could be given and i was told i would be called back , i provided updated contact details to ensure there was no issue with the details they had for me .
negative	no call back occurred and again i had to chase this up .
negative	on this call i was informed the covers had been sent back for cleaning because they were not up to their usual cleaning standard .
negative	i actually appreciated this , but it would have been nice to have been told .
negative	a few more days passed , fed up with the lack of contact at this point i contacted the people we bought the sofa and cover from ( lee longlands ) who then began to chase staingard too .
negative	eventually , nearly 0_weeks after initially making the claim we received our cover back and it was covered in more stains .
negative	frustrated we contacted lee longlands for a refund of the service we had been sold , and replacement cover .
negative	we '_ve yet to arrange a refund , but lee longlands have agreed to send out a replacement cushion cover .
negative	this saga is still on - going ( around 0 - 0_weeks on from initial claim )
negative	still_haven_'_t received the product i ordered .
negative	a pre_- order code was not sent by the time they specified on site .
negative	no answer to an_email i sent requesting support .
negative	the price was good and i hadn_'_t heard_anything bad about them , either i wasn_'_t looking hard enough or i was unlucky .
negative	either way i doubt i '_ll use them again
negative	update_: eventually got a response from support ; by_far the rudest i '_ve ever been spoken to , and had the nerve to say that the undelivered mail was my fault .
negative	haven_'_t offered to rectify undelivered order .
negative	further update_: still have not received my product , have requested a refund but coolshop will not give me one without receiving the game back - i '_m not sure how i '_m supposed to proceed since it never arrived .
negative	i '_ve posted another note to their support hopefully i '_ll get this sorted soon .
negative	bottom_line - do not use coolshop
negative	we were really pleased with the car we were given .
negative	it performed well , and it was easy on gas ,.
negative	the sevice on both_ends was great , friendly , and couteous .
negative	after a quick inspection at turn in , and no_issues found , we were off very pleased with our experience . would use auto_europe again , without reservation .
negative	because of some arbitrary daily_limit of $_00 , my purchase had to be split into two different days .
negative	first one went fine , second has now been rejected twice so ( 0 ) i can '_t complete the purchase and ( 0 ) the money from the first transaction is now locked up at pcgamesupply .
negative	very frustrating .
negative	would never use this company again , service is beyond poor , worst i have come_across in fact !
negative	the lack appreciation they have towards their customers is some what baffling .
negative	never again !
negative	had to wait 0_weeks for them to investigate the where abouts of my purchase , and as they are not contactable via phone , only email , just makes the process even more frustrating !
negative	even after 0_weeks they informed me that the product i ordered was now in fact not in stock any more !
negative	quite laughable really !
negative	!
negative	i was shipped the wrong part .
negative	do not understand when you ship wrong part why i cant get my money back .
negative	would not recommend to anyone would not use again and i maintain 0 vehicles
negative	well i still_haven_'_t actually received my order so it makes it very hard to review positively , i received an e_-_mail saying that two of the posters id ordered were not in stock ( which is fair enough ) but that i would be contacted within 00_hours about what to do about it ....
negative	i haven_'_t .
negative	and i '_m still_waiting for my order to arrive which i placed on 00th_december .
negative	and was apparently dispatched over a week_ago now , what postal service takes that long ?
negative	not the fault of tennisnuts but i am still_awaiting my racket after a week and 0 failed_attempts of delivery by parcelforce .
negative	sent wrong part and refuse to ship out the correct one i paid for .
negative	their error but want me to foot the bill to ship it back and then cancel my order and refund .
negative	if i order it again it '_s too later to receive the manufacturer '_s rebate since it had to be ordered by may 00 .
negative	if i order it again i am no_longer eligible for the manufacturers rebate .
negative	considering legal_action at this point .
negative	i installed the ink_cartridges and the printer epson artisan 000 said they do not support 0rd_party ink_cartridges .
negative	only genuine_epson cartridges will work .
negative	i have cleaned the nozzle heads but they still don_'_t work or properly recognize the new cartridges .
negative	i have wasted $_00 . 00 !!
negative	i would like someone from inkfarm to contact me and i would be happy to change my review if we can get this rectified .
negative	sincerely ,
negative	craig
negative	i had a problem with my order and they agreed to a full_refund and promised me a 00_%_discount on the re - order .
negative	now they have kept all the money from both orders .
negative	when i repeatedly complain they acknowledge their mistake and say it is a problem with the billing department and will be corrected .
negative	then another week goes by and nothing happens .
negative	this is disgraceful .
negative	while i now have received the correct prescription , i cannot recommend a group that has my money , agrees to refund me and then just ignores their promises .
negative	i have also had problems with the poor_english of the customer service representatives who appear to be writing in a second language .
negative	i am at my wit '_s end and don_'_t know how to get to a reputable employee at the company .
negative	i am not a litigious person but i don_'_t like feeling taken_advantage of by unscrupulous businesspeople .
negative	note that this has_been going on for over six_weeks .

negative	we selected laquinta as it was advertised as having wired internet and wireless .
negative	we needed to have wireless .
negative	when we arrived at the hotel we realized it did not have what we needed .
negative	we booked the hotel for 0 nights .
negative	we asked the manager for a refund and she advised us to contact our credit_card so this purchase is in dispute as we did not get was advertised .
negative	i cannot describe the poor customer service that i received from travelocity from my last purchase of air travel .
negative	only after disputing the charge with my credit_card company , opening a case with the bbb , and finally finding email address to the ceo of travelocity was i able to get a resolution .
negative	0 hours of my time spent to resolve an issue that travelocity wanted to place blame on everyone_else but themselves .
negative	trust me ...
negative	the " traveling gnome " will leave you stranded as long as he '_s got his money first !
negative	i order a book from bookbyte . com on jun 0 .
negative	estimate coming day is jun 00 .
negative	today is jun 00 , i have not receive the book yet .
negative	i prefer to pay extra money to buy books on amazon where i have never had any problem .
negative	price was right but wish i googled to read more customer reviews , ordered brake_pads , sensors and rotors for my c000 benz , 0st order should up correct , next_day 0nd order showed_up with 0 zimmerman rotor in a box which states qty of 0 , trying to call their 000 is a nightmare , will eventually hang_up on you , online support takes 00 / 00_hours to respond , and 0_weeks_later i '_m still going back and fourth with them as they are attempting to find out what happened and lastly they are blaming ups , which isn_'_t the case since i was sent two packages which was correct but they left out my 0nd rotor .
negative	now they are giving me a hard time on a refund ... save_yourself a headache and go with someone_else for auto_parts online .
negative	i was forced to give 0_star but wanted to give none .
negative	i ordered 0 window guides for a 0000 oldsmobile cutlass calais .
negative	parts_geek showed the correct part # to be 00000 dorman , costing $ 0 . 00 each plus shipping .
negative	i received the parts in a timely_manner , but it was not the correct part .
negative	the part was too small to fit the window .
negative	i went to the local_autozone and bought the correct part .
negative	they had it in stock , which suprised me since the car is 00 years old .
negative	i have not bothered to return the parts to partsgeek , not wanting the hassel .
negative	game used to be great but started awful in 0000 but i manage with them until last_year i decided gave up with them because staffs is slow , price is too high for pre_- owned ( weird price almost like to new copy or even preorder price !!)
negative	and again price is way too high and higher .
negative	i had problem with their order website because parcel lost and didn_'_t posted me and returned to game from royal_mail and i didn_'_t received 0 preordered games before or on day of released so arrived week_later .
negative	parcel lost and games not arrived home week after released that big problems last_year this why i decided use shopto . net and amazon . co . uk after all !!!
negative	i never and never touch game ever again but just trade in games for money that all i care for game .
negative	:)
negative	shame game used to be great before again .
negative	i ordered a product for my specific car a prius v 0000 and they shipped one that specifically states " not for prius v ".
negative	they even got the year wrong .
negative	i followed their directions and emailed customer service but there has_been no response .
negative	the mistake is not a big_deal but no response from customer service is a big_deal .
negative	i signed_up on saturday .
negative	had to call a 000 number to complete my application .
negative	did that spoke with a lady_who informed me i had not completed the forms properly .
negative	so it may take 00 - 00_hours to process my score ; s and credit file .
negative	i believe this is rather fishey to me .
negative	why not tell the truth .
negative	you can '_t process my info until the workweek , you want to make_sure i signed_up first and gave my credit_card number .
negative	not at all happy with that bull .
negative	why not tell customers who sign_up weekends they won_'_t be able to get scores and files until the workweek .
negative	i '_ll be calling my bank to stop payment on your phoney scam .
negative	i ordered on 0 / 0 / 0000 and today is 0 / 00 / 0000 and no order received .
negative	we were promised to have a telephone_call before delivery as our first delivery was cancelled , will not deal with o . j williams again .
negative	we booked a package to mexico for this coming november .
negative	the day after booking online , we were told our flights didn_'_t book correctly and a bookit representative booked the flights for us over the phone assuring us we were all set .
negative	the next_day we get several emails from bookit stating the flights we were assured of the night before were no_longer confirmed and that we had a price issue .
negative	i called in that night to try and resolve the issue and was told the airlines raised their prices as the seats were booked .
negative	we negotiated a deal for us to pay more and in turn we would get $_00 off and $_00 future credit .
negative	i was on the fence because we had another couple coming with is and they were not guaranteed the same offer .
negative	two_days_later we both received confirmation_emails_telling us the hotel and flights were charged to our cards and it even showed us the flight itinerarys .
negative	i called in that night to confirm the email and was told is was a system generated email and our flights were not booked .
negative	two hours on the phone and still no resolution .
negative	now we are waiting for them to review the phone_call between us and the rep who booked the flights over the phone for us to see if we are lying about the rep confirming the flights for us over the phone .
negative	lesson_learned is , don_'_t ever use bookit again .
negative	oh and my favorite part is that while on the phone i kept hearing " let_me put you on hold while i review this .
negative	give me 0 to 0 minutes please ."
negative	every time on hold ended_up being around 00 - 00_minutes .
negative	worst experience ever trying to book a trip .
negative	you '_ve been warned .
negative	i '_ve tried so hard to contact partsgeek . com by phone but to no_avail .
negative	have i known that this is just an e_-_mail based contact , i should have avoided to buy parts from them .
negative	i received a wrong part , simply because they have only one choice of this part .
negative	they did not tell you that there are other parts for this same make , yr . and model of this car .
negative	in other_words , they just give you one choice .
negative	i am referring to the headlight_assembly of my 0000_gmc acadia .
negative	the picture in the website is right , but the connectors are different .
negative	they did not show that .
negative	this company is supposedly in the business for many_years and yet , not so perfect of what they are selling .
negative	i '_m too frustrated and disappointed about my purchase experience with partsgeek . com .
negative	now .., i have to sacrifice returning the items in big boxes and to pay for all the return expenses such as freight , re - stocking fees , etc .
negative	for their mistakes .
negative	and for your information .
negative	if you make a negative_comment on this site , your posting may not be able to get through ..
negative	i ordered a black toner and three coloured toners for my laser_printer .
negative	when i went to collect the parcel from australia_post i found it was damaged .
negative	my believe is that the items were packed correctly ( i have received the same toners from you previously in the post with no damage whatsoever ) but that australia_post have mishandled them .
negative	i found a large gash in the black plastic on one corner and the cartridge on that side was compressed to about half it '_s original volume .
negative	i have refused to accept the items from australia_post until they have investigated why the parcel was so badly_damaged .

negative	i bought this bed bath and beyond card on saturday at 0pm and wondered when i was gonna get my gift_card code .
negative	i checked my email because i wanted to go to the vendor soon and buy something .
negative	i called the " customer service " number and asked [_name ] when i would receive my code and she said it was a weekend and it might be as long as monday .
negative	she said the bank info needed to be processed first .
negative	but then said i had already been charged but i might not receive the code until monday because they are low on staff .
negative	why can the staff process my $ but not give me the code immediately .
negative	thats a scam .
negative	we have enough staff to process but not to give you the code you need is what essentially is the response .
negative	you can tell what the priority of giftcards . com , and it is definitely not the customer , but their $.
negative	if i buy discounted gift_cards on line again i will not be using giftcards . com .
negative	if you care you will respond to this complaint at clintmmartin @_gmail . com .
negative	i then wanted to cancel the gift_card with [_name ] if i wasn_'_t going to receive the code today , she then said it would take 0 - 0 business days to cancel ( but you can get my $ so quickly , hmm ).
negative	well , i might as well wait for the code now and instead of getting this done on a weekend i will have to wait_until the weekday when i work .
negative	you guys need some serious work , i would love to tell about yall on social_media .
negative	too many emails to me with products i dont want and dont relate to my purchase
negative	customer service was very rude .
negative	apparently they still can '_t find my hotel or flight that i booked in their system .
negative	customer service rep was very rude with me when i called back to ask several questions .
negative	i was not given an itenerary number for my flight , just a confirmation code but that wasn_'_t good enough for travelocity .
negative	i reread the email they sent me when i booled my flight but apparently it was my mistake that i wasn_'_t given the right code .
negative	was on hold both_times i called for over 00_minutes . after being on hold for 00_minutes , they kept shuffling me off to different people to see if they could find my info and was on hold each time for over 0 minutes again .
negative	i had to call the airlines and the hotel personally just to make_sure everything_went through okay .
negative	i will never use travelocity again
negative	fboksluts . com is fling . com which is a fake site .
negative	total scam when you sign in then you get nothing but bot mails .
negative	hubby and i were in paris for a short time and decided we ' d book a " skip the line " semi_- private tour of versailles because we ' d heard so much about it and had never seen it .
negative	we went thru viatour and because of our limited time , we decided to splurge and get the expensive , skip - the - line , small group day tour that covered versailles , and the petit trianon where marie antoinette basically had a barbie ’_s playhouse type set_up .
negative	( seriously , look into it !)
negative	anyway , when the tour_guide showed_up at our hotel , he was so rude i literally thought at first he was joking .
negative	i offered my hand to shake and said in french that i was pleased to meet him .
negative	he looked at me as if i was insane and left my hand hanging in the air .
negative	my husband was aghast !
negative	it was so over - the - top rude , i had to laugh .
negative	we got into the mini_van and found another couple and apparently because of the rainy cold_weather , it would just be the four of us for the tour .
negative	the other couple was from brazil and they were very nice although none of us spoke a common language .
negative	the guide alternated speaking english and spanish for each couple and arrived at versailles too early .
negative	although it was a sunday and most of the shops were closed , he dropped us off on a main street to window shop for a half_hour and then picked us up and took us to versailles .
negative	literally , this guy was acting like he was a divorced dad with a hot date who somehow ended_up with his kids on the wrong weekend .
negative	when we got to versailles , it ’_s a bit of a walk from the car parking area to the main entrance ( so if you ’ re traveling with anyone_who needs assistance , be sure you get some kind of tour where they will take_care of everything ).
negative	we were relieved to find our grumpy guide handed us off to a nice girl guide who took us thru the main building at versailles and explained all of the architecture , artwork and rooms .
negative	even_though it was off season and an inclement day , there were busloads of people from all over the world clamoring inside for a view at things .
negative	she was great and we tipped her accordingly .
negative	once we were done , we were handed back to “ giovanni grumpy guide ” who drove us to a restaurant in the middle of nowhere .
negative	once inside , the mostly empty dining_room , he explained what we ’ d be eating and then , sat at another table by himself and ignored us .
negative	seriously , you just had to laugh !
negative	fortunately for us , the other couple , a brother and sister , were really nice and we managed with terrible sign language to make it thru lunch together and have some fun .
negative	then grumpy whisked us off to the grand and petit trianons along with the gardens and “ barbie playhouse type ” mini mock farm where marie antoinette used to dress up as a common milkmaid and play farmer .
negative	( i am not making this up .
negative	).
negative	grumpy guide was terrible and didn_’ t want to go in some of the rooms , he started amusing himself by acting as if he couldn ’ t remember we were the english speakers and they were the spanish and started talking to us in spanish and them in english .
negative	by now , all four of us were on to his childish pranks so we just ignored him and walked around .
negative	the grounds were impressive and we had a great time in spite of this weird guy we got .
negative	anyway , i totally recommend the full tour if you ’ ve never been before but only if you go when the weather ’_s nice .
negative	we went in february so it was darned cold !
negative	so plan_accordingly .
negative	as for viatour , i read on tripadvisor that they use local tour places so we just got some total nut job by the luck of the draw .
negative	still for what we paid for the day , the guy was lucky we were in a good mood despite his spitefulness .
negative	hope this helps and that you get to enjoy versailles .
negative	it ’_s a neat part of history to get to see .
negative	my 00 year_old son passed_away suddenly at the age of 00 .
negative	he had a retirement account with principal and every person i spoke to gave_me the wrong information on how to receive his funds .
negative	no less_than 0 people gave_me improper directions resulting in countless_hours of trips to notarys only to find out i was sent the wrong forms .
negative	beside the frustration in dealing_with company employees who were not knowledgeable of their services the emotional trauma of having to revisit dealing_with my deceased sons account was crushing .
negative	i felt entitled to some compensation for their bumbling this sensitive situation and while i received a letter_stating they grossly mishandled my claim they would not offer any good will gesture to make up for my time and emotional hurt .
negative	this insensitive , cold hearted bumbling company is not where you want to put your money
negative	this is now the second time i order a game from cjs and they fail to deliver .
negative	i dont understand how a company can_afford to be so incompetent with so much competition on the market .
negative	i guess they don_'_t want to stay in buisness for too_long .
negative	they don_'_t respond to mails .
negative	their support system is broken .
negative	they send duplicated keys ( same key to multiple people ).
negative	they claim to have keys in stock when they in fact do not .
negative	do not give your money to this shady company .
negative	the low price is not worth it , and there are other_companies on the market who sell their products just as cheap .
negative	edit_: you can always make excuses for your incompetence , but the bottom_line is that you made a promise which you defaulted on , or in other_words , displayed incompetence .
negative	blizzard not delivering the game boxes is not my problem .
negative	i do not import the game .
negative	i do not claim to be able to supply anyone_who_wants with a cd_key .
negative	that is what you do .
negative	it is your job and your responsibility to make_sure it happens , not mine .
negative	you can not place the burden of service on the customer .
negative	that is a degenerate attitude of doing_business and like i said , i do not expect you to remain a business for too_long .
negative	not only that but i see no excuses for why keys were duplicated , why you do not respond to mails , and why your support system is broken .
negative	do you not even try to relieve yourself of guilt on these matters ?
negative	have you accepted your level of service as " pathetic "?
negative	or worse , do you think your customers will accept this level of service ?
negative	ok so they left me two sorry we missed you slips on my door , when just the day before i talked to one of thair rep to make_sure they would not miss me again after the rep told me they would drop my box after 0 : 00 they showed_up at 0 : 00 i call and was told i needed to pay for the service wtf so i had to dtive to the other side of town to pick_up something they messed_up .
negative	also i have a fedex office 0 mins from my house they would not leave it there i could have drove to the west_coast and picked_up my box myself .
negative	i will never use fedex again i will be blogging about this also i '_m sure i '_m not the only one to have this problem .
negative	i had ordered a part that was supposedly in stock at a great price .
negative	once i ordered the part i had the money taken out of my bank immediately .
negative	no_problems there , just 0 days_later i get a email_saying the part was out of stock and my money would be refunded in 0 - 0 business days .
negative	my problem is i wouldn_'_t have purchased the item if i would have known it was out of stock .
negative	second i shouldn_'_t have to wait for my money to come_back to me especially if parts_geek took it directly out within 0 minutes of me ordering it .
negative	this is only the beginning .
negative	once i found this out i tried_contacting parts feel through email and by phone .
negative	i did not get a response back from either one which is very aggravating .
negative	i just wanted to order the right part , if in stock , and everything would be good .
neutral	i ordered on april 00 and finally received my order today , may 00 .
neutral	i understand the " dr oz " show took them by surprise , but that response is only good for the first few_days , then it becomes an excuse .
neutral	i understand the frustration folks are going thru , as i filed a complaint with paypal two_days before receiving my order .
neutral	the product came to me as_discribed and as shown , but the company needs to communicate more with the public or it is going to see more negative_comments which could easily be avoided .
neutral	airline_tickets were great , motel was okay for a quality inn , the car_rental was not good at all ..
neutral	picked_up the car and before the first day was out it started to overhead .
neutral	will more then likely not rent from budget again
neutral	i received one item with great delivery time ; the other item arrived but the wrong physical product was in the packaging , so i received the wrong item .
neutral	my problem is detailed in the email string below .... i would like to receive the correct item , then provide a proper review .
neutral	thank_you ,

neutral	to whom it may concern :
neutral	please refer to customer order #_0000000 , transaction #_000000 , package id #_0000000 .
neutral	i received my order today but will need to return the item for exchange .
neutral	one of the 0 - pieces of the item is badly_scratched and cannot be installed as existing .
neutral	the item was properly_packaged and arrived intact but the product was probably scratched before being placed within the heavy plastic shipping sleeve .
neutral	could someone please_advise on return for exchange instructions ??
neutral	thanks ,
neutral	marty l .
neutral	rim was slightly scratched around the edges .
neutral	not a huge issue , but a little disappointing .
neutral	signage in rome_airport for the location of the rental office is sorely lacking .
neutral	took us quite a bit of wandering and inquiry to get to the rental office .
neutral	once there the staff took_care of us very well and had us on our way .
neutral	likewise , returning our car to rome train_station was a big headache .
neutral	there was no apparent sign for rental_car return .
neutral	had to park , go inside the terminal , find the office , retrieve the car and drive it to the appropriate area where i was instructed to just " double park " the car and lock it and bring the keys inside .
neutral	no receipt for the car was given .
neutral	completely different experience than returning a car in frankfurt where they went over the car with a fine tooth_comb .
neutral	italians vs . germans
neutral	we use partsgeek every week , and they almost always have the best price anywhere .
neutral	however , if you do have a question , or problem with a part it is impossible to get in contact with anyone .
neutral	over hour long wait times on hold , and emails do not get returned ... customer service would make this parts supplier unbeatable !
neutral	wrong color we ordered the blue and received the green one .
neutral	i have many issues signing into the website through my mobile_phone .
neutral	i click on alerts and nothing happens .
neutral	i need to open the whole list of messages before the link works .
neutral	i '_m not around my pc that much so my mobile_phone is my pc .
neutral	the ink_cartridge leaks upon_opening stained my chair
neutral	last two deliveries have been poor .
neutral	one order was incorrect the other took ages despite paying for next_day delivery , i was given a 00_%_off my next order but still not great service .
neutral	sorry folks but will probably look_elsewhere next time
neutral	i love alpha_brain and always look_forward to getting my bottle of it !
neutral	but this time when i decided to order the 00count bottle , i decided to open it right when i got it and count them .
neutral	there were only 00 out of 00 there .
neutral	i recounted 0 - 0 times just to make_sure i wasn_'_t wrong but i wasn_'_t .
neutral	the price they got for me was good , but their customer or service or lack_thereof until after the fact was very disappointing and resulted_in unneeded stress .
neutral	there '_s no way to reach them by phone and when you shoot an e_-_mail it can take days to over a week to get a response .
neutral	in all fairness , they tried to help me once they finally responded which tells_me they just don_'_t have enough people onboard .
neutral	if they add more personell this could be a great service as they absolutely saved me money .
neutral	good service with only one minor problem ..... a lack of communication between shipsticks and the ups carrier , no phone_call from the driver , nothing ..... if was not for me to stay out of the house waiting for the truck to come by in the evening nothing would have happened .
neutral	websites , emails , apps are great , but old_school communication tools are essential to well serve the golf lovers community .
neutral	while parts are pretty_much available and at competitive prices , customer service is virtually non_- existing .
neutral	there is no way that one can talk to someone to have questions_answered and issues resolved right_away .
neutral	rmas take too_long and everything has to be done via_e_-_mail .
neutral	i ordered two harmonick balance repair sleeves , they are very lite weight , and small , don , t understand_why i get one ups and the day after got the other in regular mail . that would have put me a day late finishing my job i had to do , so i just went to near by napa parts and purchased another one . anyway the two sleeves i purchased should have been in same package .
neutral	typo on address would not resend , have to reorder .
neutral	don_'_t advertise " free shipping " if you are going to jack me for a " handling " charge .
neutral	it '_s deceptive and false_advertising .
neutral	nice apartment but suffers from ill fitting doors that rattle when the building front_door is opened and excessive noise every time a neighbour uses the staircase .
neutral	some serious sound proofing of the stairs is required .
neutral	ordered on monday , received order the next monday with no tracking available , i didn_'_t know if i had been ripped_off or if the item was really on the way .
neutral	this caused an uneasy feeling about this company and caused unwanted and unneeded stress .
neutral	i will probably not use this company again , even_though they had the lowest_price , the last thing most of need in our_lives is more stress .
neutral	en_la web dice que si haces el_pedido antes_de_una hora concreta , tienes el material al dia siguiente .
neutral	hice el_pedido antes_de_la hora en cuestión y al dia siguiente no recibí el material .
neutral	llamé a ver que pasaba y me dijeron que para tener - lo el dia siguiente , aparte de realizar el_pedido antes_de_la hora límite , tenía que llamar para pedir que_se envíase ese mismo dia .
neutral	esta condicion no aparece en_la web ni en_el mail de confirmación de pedido .
neutral	además , tienes que perder el tiempo y dinero que supone realizar la llamada .
neutral	i ordered 0 sets of plectrums ( 00 in total ) for which i was charged 0 delivery charges .
neutral	one for each set .
neutral	the plectrums would have fitted into a small jiffy_bag , instead they were dispatched as one order in a small bag inside a box approximatly 00 inches square which had then been filled with packing .
neutral	my experienc with pure health was overall pleasant , but when called the phone_number provided no on answered , and the shipping took 00 days .
neutral	no problem with blackcircles but the garage used to fit they tyres was not great .
neutral	had an_appointment for 0 . 00 on the saturday which suited me .
neutral	i was phoned by blackcircles on the friday to ask if i could have the car at the garage for 0 oclock on the saturday which i agreed to .
neutral	i assumed that by making the effort to have the car in so early i would not have to wait long .
neutral	i was asked to come_back in 0 hours .
neutral	0 hours to change 0 tyres seems a long time to me .
neutral	happy with they tyres , not happy with the service !
neutral	tried for 0 days to fix my printer but with no success - total_cost £ 0
neutral	we would have been completely_satisfied but we were sent the wrong color !!
neutral	we really need to get this fixed asap and getting the wrong color was a disappointment ; however if the right color was sent we would have rated it a 00 !!
neutral	!
neutral	took a while to receive my key since it was out of stock but in the end i got it after a couple of hours .
neutral	missing items in shipment , website charged me twice , they fixed some issues but it was a frustrating experience .
neutral	will only shop in store from now on , which is great .
neutral	update_: ok so after holding for another hour ... finally got this very nice man in india who spoke great english .. negotiated to give me a credit 00_% of my costs good for a flight anywhere with same carrier , a cost of $_000 change plane fee to pay to the carrier ... so i rebooked to go see grandpa .
neutral	not my first choice but at_least they tried .
neutral	this took way to long , was a complete hassle when through 0 people to finally get someone to help me but ... cost me a couple of hundred_dollars more and at_least i wasn_'_t totally out of pocket on this flight .
neutral	history :
neutral	so you go online , you buy your ticket , you buy trip cancellation_insurance and all looks good .
neutral	then you get an_email every 0 hours trying to sell you more tickets ... haven_'_t gotten them to turn that off yet .
neutral	now my trip was cancelled .
neutral	yesterday i spent 0 hours on hold , then an asian - sounding agent i could barely understand came on the phone and after about 00_minutes of futzing around said he couldn_'_t help me and transferred me to the " concerned dept " .
neutral	this chap futz around for a few_minutes only to tell me he didnt cover cheapoair problems and that i had to call 000 - 000 - 0000 ... which turns_out to be the same number i had before ... today i am on hold for 00_minutes and still now response .
neutral	this travel company doesn_'_t seem to care .
neutral	if you buy a ticket ... dont_bother to buy the insurance , it isn_'_t good for anything and of course you will never get these_guys on the phone .
neutral	i am calling the airline to see if they can help me .... # cheapoairsucks
neutral	good selection , good prices , bad information !
neutral	!
neutral	when the website say '_s in stock why do you contact me to arrange a delivery 0_weeks_later .
neutral	if its in stock then surely its not made to order ?
neutral	if argos , tesco , asda can deliver in 0 days why not homebase ?
neutral	?
neutral	from what i see everything works nicely , but you need to provide software for mac '_s !
neutral	a lot of people have them and just offering it for pc '_s is stupid .
neutral	i cannot understand_why it '_s nearly always possible to purchase the smaller weight ( 0lb ) bags of species specific parrot food , ( which are clearly at a much higher per kilo cost ) yet the more popular , economical weights ( 0lb ) are rarely available ?
neutral	?
neutral	very hard and firm on my teeth compared to previous brush_head .
neutral	it may be that it will become ok as i become used to it .
neutral	i will persevere
neutral	the onnit site has a lot of broken and outdated links , and things that would / wouldn_'_t move to the cart .
neutral	it was ok and i was able to make my order , but it was also a bit of a pain .
neutral	i would say my main beef with this company is the fact i was charged_twice for one booking at a total of $_000 . 00 , i did make a reservation , cancelled it and then rebooked but i was never refunded the original charge , all done some months prior to the date of travel , so not particularly_impressed .
neutral	the door i ordered was just as we wanted and the company kept me in touch .
neutral	however when i got the e_-_mail linking me to xpd then the problems began .
neutral	i could not e_-_mail the local depot to arrange a delivery date .
neutral	i phoned them on the monday and arranged for delivery the following_monday .
neutral	they turned_up on the day after my phone_call and couldn_'_t believe we were not in !!!
neutral	eventually got a delivery on the thursday and i told them i was going away and had to pick my wife up from work at 00 . 00 as we were setting off from her workplace .
neutral	they arrived at 00 . 00 and wondered_why i was annoyed .
neutral	prices were about the best i could find , but i placed my order sunday_afternoon , and fedex wasn_'_t notified until thursday_evening that my packages were ready to be shipped .
neutral	the overall process was easy to follow and i would highly_reccomend it .
neutral	being an ex motor trader i respect hpi as an organisation to trust and respect .
neutral	one issue with the driveaway insurance .
neutral	i bought a converted van to motorhome .
neutral	after sitting on the aviva call_centre line for 00_minutes , then going through the application they told me they would not insure it .
neutral	if you value your time , like i do .
neutral	just get the insurance sorted beforehand and save_yourself a couple of hours .
neutral	purchase process was fine .
neutral	however , i sent an e_-_mail question through the web_site and never received a response .
neutral	i was not impressed .
neutral	since it is the # 0 social_network however with all their take it or leave it makeovers and the serious lack of privacy , their needs to better privacy settings , and the possible hacking by anonymous it does raise concerns how your life is being displayed for all to see .
neutral	we have many online businesses and refuse to allow any review site to take control of our reputation - if they choose too .
neutral	you are maybe asking for trouble if you sign_up
neutral	*** updated ( after 0 months of usage ) ...
neutral	i '_ve changed our original rating from 0_star to 0_stars .. we '_ve not yet had a negative_review and was expecting one or two from known competitors who do this sort of thing .
neutral	if we do receive a fake negative_review i am confident now that we can report the review as fake and have it removed without too much aggravation .
neutral	had the part i needed .
neutral	at a good price well_worth my time .
neutral	it '_s a shame you can '_t get on the internet to pick_up a few small rubber pieces for a 0000_mercedes diesel that the local parts stores can '_t even find on their computers .
neutral	i usually pay_attention to shipping_charges , but i was in hurry and just went with getting the parts .
neutral	that '_s like i like to have a few projects going at once .
neutral	i can take my time and look around for suppliers that have good deals on parts and shipping .
neutral	garage staff friendly as always but took hour and half to fit 0 tyres .
neutral	also they did not point out my tracking was in dire need of adjustment as seen by the inner edge of my tyres being almos bald .
neutral	if i had not known i would have unwittingly worn down my new tyres too .
neutral	can not fault black_circles though .
neutral	a0
neutral	if you have a dog then petflow . com is a breeze to use .
neutral	i have cats , and since the site switches to a dog oriented search every time the user changes pages , life is difficult for those_who want to purchase things for cats .
neutral	i have to re - select the cat category repeatedly to do my shopping , even when i have a known profile and petflow . com knows i have cats .
neutral	this should be an easy fix to gain a higher rating , but at this point i feel_like petflow believes that cats ( and their owners ) are 0nd_class customers .
neutral	otherwise , great products and delivery - hard to fault them beyond the poor web_site .
neutral	i '_ve been spending a lot of time and money here lately
neutral	i have been using this company for 0 - 0 years_now and have never had cause to complain until now .
neutral	have the original owners sold out ?
neutral	something has changed .
neutral	what were very clear and simple terms have now been made complex to the point where you have to be_careful that what you think you are booking is actually what you will get .
neutral	regular users proceed with caution !
neutral	i contacted your company and asked the time frame we would be looking at so i could set my flight schedule .
neutral	i was to fly out the following wensday , i had to get my yellow fever vacine and send off everything to them fedex that day , including two money orders for 00 dollars to ghana embassy and diane ?.
neutral	so i sent it out wensday with my prepaid_label .
neutral	it was received thursday but he made a mistake the money orders were suppose to be for 00 $ ghana 00 $ diane which would delay everything iset the the money orders and i was mad as hell .
neutral	he received them friday a nd got it offtothe embassy on friday .
neutral	to change my flight would cost me aprx .
neutral	000 $ more and i was very worried and nervous .
neutral	i got a call from adam that my visa was sent out that night and should be here in the afternoon i waited and waited then about 0 pm i got notification my package missed the currier and would not be tome till after my flight left .
neutral	after a lot of calls they located where it was and i had little time to find the place and get my package .
neutral	i got there the lady at fedex was nice enough to look for it before she went home and i got it .
neutral	this all should of never happened and i feel a big apology is needed , also your people need to be accurate i telling us what is needed for this .
neutral	in many ways i paid for this mistake lots a extra driving worry , etc .
neutral	friends and family receiving my homemade wine and don_'_t believe i made " this " wine by the packaging thanks to mol .
neutral	i have made some very attractive personnel wine label and alway pick out the foil toppers to finish off the the look .
neutral	they alway arrive on time or before scheduled .
neutral	this is a great service i advise all to experience for themselves .
neutral	if you ' re desperate for a car oak_motors can help , but you ' re gonna pay way more than the true value of the car .
neutral	they take_advantage of the fact that people can not finance elsewhere due to bad credit and their need for reliable transportation .
neutral	efficient , but when i wanted more information , i was sent links rather_than replies which would have been more useful
neutral	some products came as_described .
neutral	shipping timing was off .
neutral	maybe fed_ex , maybe parts_geek .
neutral	i understood things get shipped from different_warehouses .
neutral	i tried to call up and speak its someone to discuss a broken strut_assembly that i received .
neutral	only to be told i had to submit a ticket and i would be contacted in 00 / 00_hours .
neutral	that '_s not great customer service .
neutral	i purchase things with great shipping / return_policies and top_notch service .
neutral	i already have made further_purchases elsewhere due to those factors .
neutral	i don_'_t have 00 / 00_hours to waste on you getting back to me .
neutral	the quidco concept is excellent but it does not function as well as it used to .
neutral	despite the tracking banner ( a great idea ) more often than not it doesn_'_t track .
neutral	what we need is some confirmation ( it used to be an_email ) after the purchase that tracking is set .
neutral	more often than not it doesn_'_t track and you have to create a " ticket " which frankly if it '_s a couple of quid it '_s not worth the effort .
neutral	it also takes far to long to get the payout - 0 months for aviva for car insurance ?
neutral	part was ordered 0 / 0 / 00 , received confirmation same day .
neutral	part was supposedly shipped 0 / 0 / 00 , but ups didn_'_t ship till 0 / 0 / 00 .
neutral	ups_tracking says it will be delivered tomorrow 0 / 00 / 00 .
neutral	so i can '_t comment on part because i don_'_t have it yet .
neutral	the first suit i ordered fitted beautifully and so i ordered a second one .
neutral	the second , 0 - piece , suit arrived but sadly , the sleeves are too_long and the jacket too big across the chest and does not look at all good .
neutral	sleeves : measuring from shoulder seam to cuff there is a difference of 00mm
neutral	chest : measuring across the jacket from below the armpit there is 00mm difference .
neutral	the waistcoat is too big across the chest but as the first suit was 0 - piece i cannot give you a difference in size .
neutral	i would appreciate your comments to my dilemma .
neutral	thank_you .
neutral	website slow to use and requires constantly returning to the original search when comparing benefits of accomodations .
neutral	the preferred currency button is unreliable and has led me to being charged for a foreign rather_than a domestic transaction by my card company .
neutral	perhaps the worst part of the site is the reviews .
neutral	almost invariably reviews fail to upload if written it directly from the e_-_mail request .
neutral	text boxes ( like this ) are painful to use and changes / corrections extremely difficult without deleting and staring again .
neutral	if the review is then lost when the upload fails , i '_m not surprised that few people bother leaving a review .
neutral	those that do persevere deserve a medal ( nothing like humility .. lol )
neutral	they should inform you that the discount means you pay in full for a reservation .
neutral	good prices and friendly customer service .
neutral	however , my cans of dog / cat_food usually come dented from poor packaging .
neutral	i '_ve called about this twice , they kindly assure me they will resolve this with the packagers , but it never makes a difference to the actual packaging .
neutral	i currently just assume some cans will be dented and they usually are .
neutral	also , for repeat order programs , you get warned that a shipment is coming to give you a chance to change the dates .
neutral	great !
neutral	i can postpone my order by a week or two .
neutral	but then you don_'_t get another email , the next time it '_s just shipped out without_any warning .
neutral	so i often end up getting an order when i didn_'_t need anything , which is very frustrating .
neutral	i wish they would resolve these two problems , otherwise if i find somewhere cheaper i will immediately switch to the new company .
neutral	i placed an order for a locking gas_cap for my taurus .
neutral	when i tried to enter my po_box ( i can '_t get mail delivered to my home ) the entry on the order form was refused with , " we don_'_t deliver to po_boxes ".
neutral	so i figured that the parcel would be sent ups or fedex .
neutral	when i got the e_-_mail receipt back it showed that the item had been sent by us mail ..... go figure !
neutral	i try to find a phone_number for customer service and there is none .
neutral	i e_-_mail customer service to tell them that unless the postmaster goes to the trouble to look up my po_box number by using my name and physical_address , their package might be returned .
neutral	i got a reply by e_mail saying the same thing ... my package had been sent usps .
neutral	i then sent a fax stating the problem .
neutral	never got a reply .
neutral	luckily my post master cross referenced my physical_address and placed the order in my po_box .
neutral	you call this " customer service "??
neutral	?
neutral	when i contacted rev , the person at the other end was not very helpful and somewhat abrasive .
neutral	turn_around time was great
neutral	competitive costs
neutral	transcription was not accurate ; mismatch between speaker and quote
neutral	in the past , i used rev and i was very pleased .
neutral	in view that this experience might be an_anomaly , i do plan to use rev again
neutral	wrong sensor sent for porsche 000s0 - replaced parts but no apology .
neutral	now that i have this service set_up properly , it works well enough and is finally cooperating with my google_voice account .
neutral	i had two problems - spoofing your google_voice number from your phone_power account is not a good idea .
neutral	correcting this is not something you can do for yourself .
neutral	i had to make multiple calls to phone_power to get this set correctly .
neutral	it should have been handled correctly the first time .
neutral	phone_power service rep was a bit snarky .
neutral	gv locks you out of your voicemail if you try to access it from phone_power with a spoofed gv phone_number .
neutral	also , if you want gv to handle your voicemail , you have to do a somewhat deeper dive into your phone_power account to customize the number of rings so that the call goes to google_voice voicemail , otherwise your calls will go to phone_power voicemail , which is not what i wanted .
neutral	also , i am not thrilled that the rate i got for switching from from free gv to for - pay phone_power seems to be an introductory rate and does not seem to be renewable .
neutral	i would have done some more research into alternatives had i known this was the case before_committing myself to phone_power .
neutral	it seems that people whose gv was working as mine was through an obi 000 could have kept free gv call termination for some time after the threatened cut - off date - i can '_t do without a phone line .
neutral	i have a fiber connection and no_issues with voice quality so_far .
neutral	i use google namebench to test my dns .
neutral	namebench showed that there were some faster dns servers other than those provided by my isp .
neutral	i changed the dns providers that my router uses based on the output from namebench .
neutral	people who are complaining_about voice quality with phone_power might want to try testing / modifying their dns servers before pinning it all on phone_power .
neutral	i ordered struts for my 00 tacoma .
neutral	took_longer_than i thought it would .. i was trying to get white ones , like in the picture but when i got them , they were silver .. by_far the cheapest though ...
neutral	will probably use again , but will make_sure to call to confirm what im gettin ..
neutral	the drop_off and pick_up procedure and staff at the airport itself are excellent , efficient and extremely professional .
neutral	unfortunately , the customer service team dealing_with bookings are not as good .
neutral	i was in the usa and my return flight to heathrow was changed a week before coming_back to a new date and flight number .
neutral	i emailed customer_services to advise of this and asked for a confirmation of the new pick_up time .
neutral	i did receive an_automated acknowledgment email_saying they would respond in 00hours ; however , 0 days_later , this did not happen so i had to follow this up with a telephone_call from abroad and ask to speak to a supervisor before the changes were made which given the time difference and 00 minute roaming charges were disappointing .
neutral	they also said they weren_'_t aware of the new arrival dates which means no one bothered reading the emails .
neutral	ordered a roof top aircond .
neutral	when product was ordered the sales_staff was short on their cross selling skills .
neutral	upon ordering the unit , it would have been customer friendly for the sales_staff to follow through on cross - selling - skills .
neutral	that would have allowed_us to realize that an interior control unit was required for our make , year , and model camper .
neutral	a second call ( order ) was required in order for us to complete the repair .
neutral	the product is a +
neutral	sales c -
neutral	not the best after sales service - cumbersome arrangement with not being_able to correspond via_email including this feedback .
neutral	delivery was a complete joke .
neutral	waited in all day .
neutral	had to ring fedex three_times .
neutral	eventually at gone five o ' clock the fedex van pulls up .
neutral	having a 0000_volvo c00 , i have a tuff time finding the correct replacement parts .
neutral	parts_geek '_s web_sight made it easy to understand what iam purchasing .
neutral	i love that town_fair_tire will plug / repair my tire when i have a nail in it , but why does it take them 0 - 0 hours to do it ?!?!
neutral	my car is only in the bay for 00_mins tops ?
neutral	why am i waiting another 0 - 0 . 0 hrs to get in there ?
neutral	can '_t i make an_appointment so i don_'_t have to spend an evening roaming around the nearby locations waiting to get into the bay ?
neutral	just a suggestion .
neutral	otherwise , the price is good and so is the service .
neutral	delivery is very slow 0_weeks to get some shocks .
neutral	i am presently waiting to see how they will respond to a mistake of a wrong part .
neutral	i have had difficulty trying to get an answer so i will not give any positive_comments yet .
neutral	if they rectify the situation by allowing me to return a wrong part and a return of funds , i will gladly add my praise .
neutral	great tasting , awesome ingredients , but super overpriced : only ten servings_per 000g container .
neutral	i can buy high_quality , organic hemp_protein much_cheaper .
neutral	much love to onnit , but i won_'_t be ordering any more hemp_force .
neutral	i think i got a good product for the money spent , but i was told i would be in and out in 00 - 00_mins ( and i had an_appointment !)
neutral	but i was there for two hours , with no update while waiting , no apology or financial concession .
neutral	after you spend $_000 you should not drive off the premises frustrated or disappointed .
neutral	at that moment , i left spending what i considered significant money and i was not pleased with my experience .
neutral	bought the inner_fender well and front guard for inside the wheel well on my 0000 lesabre .
neutral	the inner fenderwell was paper_thin compared to the original , the front guard was much_better in quality and thickness .
neutral	didn_'_t use the inner fenderwell because of the quality .
neutral	i use printerinks for all my domestic needs but feel the loyalty to me could be better .
neutral	little incentive to re - order in future
neutral	giovedì 00 maggio al mattino ho_acquistato tramite il_sito 0 gomme hankook ventus v00 a 00 , 00 euro cadauna + smaltimento pneumatici , pago immediatamente con bonifico bancario , trasmetto copia della contabile con n . di cro e chiedo la_consegna entro lunedì .
neutral	al pomeriggio mi contatta l ' azienda dicendo che_le_gomme non_sono disponibili ; chiedo una alternativa in pronta consegna e mi indicano le kumho kh00 a 00 , 00 euro l ' una .
neutral	accetto anche_se la differenza ( minima , 0euro ) non_mi può essere restituita .
neutral	mi aspetto che_le_gomme mi arrivino lunedi , massimo martedì , ed invece arrivano il venerdì successivo .
neutral	inoltre le_gomme non risultano di produzione recente ( dot di fine 0000 / inizio 0000 ).
neutral	the service was very nice indeed .
neutral	the questions were answered quickly and free of confusion .
neutral	the only problem was the shipping , were i asked for a quickly dispatch because i would going to need the package in 00 days , there was a email_confirming that but after all , only one week after the real shipping happened .
neutral	this kind of error have to be addressed because it made me think everything was ok and only one week after i realized it wasn_'_t .
neutral	if for some reason i was purchasing the items for a business with intention to sell , my sales could be compromised with this delay , after thinking and assuring the final costumer that everything was on time .
neutral	edit_: it didn_'_t arrived yet .
neutral	i '_m still_waiting .
neutral	according to the shipping company , only monday .
neutral	i needed it for this weekend .
neutral	=(
neutral	i will probably buy again from this store because of their friendliness and regards for the customer , but i hope that if a there is a time restrain i would be informed .
neutral	i think this is good way to travel but be aware that there are some hiccups in the process .
neutral	i once had to pay my own way back to the hotel after waiting an_hour and a half at the airport .
neutral	i continuously called the hotel to pick me up and they kept saying they were sending someone .
neutral	i won_'_t use that particular hotel again to fly but i will use this website because they don_'_t all operate like that .
neutral	good , but if you comparison shop you can 00_% the time find a better deal be it shipping or more items , amazon is often misleading with the number of items to be sent .
neutral	we liked the site and the price of items .
neutral	however after going through the procedure of ordering the product we entered our post code and it wouldn_'_t accept it tried several_times and finished up ordering by telephone .
neutral	the service was excellent and order arrived within_00hrs .
neutral	it was a shame we were frustrated by the website !
neutral	i found the product i was looking for , and placed the order , expecting it to arrive within the time frame i needed it .
neutral	nothing on the web_site showed that the item was out of stock , but i received an_email from a few_days_later saying the item was out of stock , and on order .
neutral	had i known that , i would have ordered the item from someone_else , since it wasn_'_t going to arrive on time .
neutral	i sent an_email to the company notifying them of the issue , and asked if they could help point me to where i could get it sooner , but i never_heard_anything back from them until the product shipped , a week_later than what i needed it .
neutral	they shipped what i paid for , it just would have been nice to be given all the information i needed to make the best decision for my purchase .
neutral	i looked up the part on the partsgeek . com website .
neutral	the part that came up for my model make and year ( the only choice listed ) turned_out to be a trunk lift support for the convertible and not the hatch lift support for the hardtop coupe i was needing .
neutral	after e_- mailing them to arrange an exchange , they said they would send me an_rma within 0 days .
neutral	it has_been 0 days and no rma .
neutral	they have no parts exchange program so exchanging a part takes weeks not days .
neutral	their shipping time was reasonable .
neutral	i like the website and their intent seems genuine , just not overly_impressed .
neutral	i will most_likely use them again in the future and hope for a 0 - star experience ... :~)
neutral	hi , tyre received in good time , was looking_forward to fitting on the wheel and test out onthe turbo_trainer , only to find the normal innertube was too big , so had to wait_until i good source the right size innertube .
neutral	once innertube was brought and fitted with new tyre i have been happily turbo training with out disturbing the wife noise wise .
neutral	it would have been helpful for your website to ask if i needed an innertube to go with the tyre , otherwise , good product and service and would recommend the website
neutral	we reorder the same buttons yearly .
neutral	i have asked for the buttons to be saved so there is not a set_up fee charge .
neutral	we get charged every time .
neutral	where is the love for the repeat_customer ?
neutral	ordered a set of stickers for a triumph street triple , i paid for first_class recorded delivery (£ 0 . 00ish ), as i was in the middle of painting a bike for a friend i expected to get these within a day or two at the most , after having no sign of them 0 days_later i called to enquire on their whereabouts .
neutral	the guy i spoke to told me he hadn_'_t " gotten around " to doing them yet and that he ' d been planning on making them on sunday to post on monday , i didn_'_t get an appology either .
neutral	stickers finally arrived on wensday , if i '_m paying for something like this and i '_m charged first_class recorded i sort of expect to not have to wait over a week for them to arrive because someone plainly just can '_t be bothered to pull his finger out any sooner , also making a profit off the postage charges is a cheap thing to do ( postage was well under_£ 0 .. the envelope didn_'_t cost the rest i '_m sure ).
neutral	overall the stickers where pretty good , just a shame i had to wait so long to get them , i would have used you again but sadly after this sort of treatment i '_ll go elsewhere .
neutral	we stayed at the thistle victoria so pick_up was just outside the hotel .
neutral	came out of the hotel at 00 : 00 but as there were no buses waiting we decided to have a drink in the pub opposite .
neutral	left the pub at 00 : 00 as a bus had just parked up .
neutral	we wanted to do the red_tour but the bus was for the blue .
neutral	( there was an issue with this bus as it stayed put ) not a problem though as the information leaflet specfied tours run at 00 - 00 minute intervals although we knew that was subject to change .
neutral	we waited for 00 - 00_minutes and 0 or 0 buses arrived but they were all for the ' blue_tour '.
neutral	the driver of bus that had parked up was waiting around and we asked_him when the ' red_tour ' bus would arrive .
neutral	he spoke on his phone / radio and advised that the bus would be 0 - 0 minutes .
neutral	we waited a further 00_minutes and another ' blue_tour ' bus arrived ... swiftly followed by another .
neutral	overall we waited an_hour and ten_minutes for a ' red_tour ' bus and because of the delay had to cut the tour short as we had pre_- booked tickets for the london_eye .
neutral	we appreciate it was the day of the olympic marathon and we were expecting minor delays , but a 00 minute wait was excessive .
neutral	the large bug was that , when ordering the soft copy of a book for the reduced price , it '_s not possible to modify the quantity of the book you ' re ordering ( or , if it is , i couldn_'_t find it and it wasn_'_t readily_available on the website ).
neutral	i wanted two copies and had to place two_separate_orders .
neutral	ordered the parts for next_day delivery via_paypal , no e_-_mail acknowledgement from gsf only from paypal , parts didn_'_t arrive , phone ' d gsf to be told shipment had gone to the wrong depot and they eventually arrived very late the following_day with no appology , was unable to track the shipment .
neutral	frankly , i paid about $_000 for a warranty that cost me $_000 later to have my daughter '_s phone repaired .
neutral	so in the end , i basically paid $_000 for a used phone .
neutral	( i could '_ve just tossed it and bought a new moto g for $_000 .)
neutral	i took it to a local repair_shop that said they wouldn_'_t repair it because it had water_damage along with the cracked_screen .
neutral	so i had to send it to square_trade who actually sent me back a different phone .
neutral	( i can tell because the edges of my daughter '_s phone had scratches and this one doesn_'_t have water_damage .)
neutral	so did they resolve the issue ?
neutral	absolutely .
neutral	was it worth buying the insurance ?
neutral	nope .
neutral	product is good , home delivery is convenient , i would like an_email sent 0 week ahead of time explaining the order with a way to modify the order online ..
neutral	we had a hard_drive failure and fields_data was able to recover the data for us .
neutral	we found the price a bit_steep --$ 000 rather_than the $_000 in the ads , but they were willing to work on a private and non_- corporate issue .
neutral	we had quotes of $ 0000 just to diagnose the problem from more corporately oriented companies .
neutral	we sent in our hardware and we got the diagnostic and results as_promised .
neutral	however communication was not all it could be -- results could only be viewed with chrome browser or safari -- and that was not specified .
neutral	once we knew this , we could see from their report that the data we were interested in was recovered , and we happily gave them our credit_card .
neutral	but we were not informed that by paying with a credit_card we would incur a overseas transaction fee because the charge was by a british bank , so $_00 . 00 was added to the $_000 quoted which we were not expecting .
neutral	had we known this we might have chosen another kind of payment .
neutral	we gave them authority to charge our card on 0 / 00 / 0000 , but we did not receive our data .
neutral	we called the recovery specialist using a cell_phone he was not familiar with he answered and told us that his office had had a hard_drive failure of their own .
neutral	once again he promised to send the data .
neutral	when we got our credit_card statement without_any e_-_mail that the data had been shipped , we disputed the charge .
neutral	the next_day , we had an e_-_mail that the data had been shipped , and 0 days_later we got the dvd with the data .
neutral	we then un - disputed the charge .
neutral	on the whole , our experience was positive with regard to performance , unsatisfactory with regard to communication , and ok with regard to cost .
neutral	the specialist tried to blame delays on our only having given him a po_box , but we were never asked for a physical_address .
neutral	we had asked to have the data shipped with tracking_info but this was not done .
neutral	finally the data arrived by usps_priority_mail about 0 days after we were told to expect it .
neutral	all our mail comes to a po_box .
neutral	even the ups drivers occasionally drop packages off at the post_office for our po_box .
neutral	on the whole , our experience was positive with regard to performance , unsatisfactory with regard to communication , and ok with regard to cost .
neutral	the company delivered on its promises finally , and possibly under_pressure .
neutral	they could work on their communication with customers would be our main criticism , but on the whole we would recommend them .
neutral	this was my first time using this site .
neutral	the process was quick and easy but i was disappointed to be sent the wrong frames .
neutral	although it was the same brand , the style and prescription were wrong .
neutral	the customer service representatives were helpful , especially nicole who answered my call several_times .
neutral	i '_m quite happy with the frames but i hope this issue doesn_'_t happen often .
neutral	the prices on victoria_plumb are always good , and as a trade customer we are eligable for next_day delivery .
neutral	however , why pay extra for delivery on tuesday instead of wednesday , when it turns up on wednesday anyway ?
neutral	!
neutral	way too much noise in background at call_center .
neutral	hard to hear reservation rep . found out call_center was not a marriott center but an expedia center .
neutral	rep was helpful and efficient in placing reservation .
neutral	yes great prices but bad delivery i needed to have the parts in before sunday .
neutral	so that my michanic could put them in before my vacation but no way i got the water_pump last and i did not get them together that '_s not right .
neutral	well thank_you for the awesome price but why should i get any more parts from you company and i do need more parts .
neutral	the building itself is very nice ( looks nice , and contemporary ), but none of that matters if the place isn_'_t managed well .
neutral	we arrived at 0am and our room got mixed up with someone_else ( that we woke_up when we tried to get into the room ), when we let the front_desk know they immediately called the people in the room waking them up again ...
neutral	they got it straightened_out and gave_us coupons for a " free " breakfast - turns_out if you get anything hot at breakfast that '_s an extra fee ($_00 / person !)
neutral	so we still had to pay for it .
neutral	the air vent in the room was covered in mold and make my wife and i sick every time we went into the room .
neutral	the ice machines were broken , the bar and in - hotel restaurant closed early without notice .
neutral	the shower door didn_'_t close properly and got water all over the floor .
neutral	i '_m sure there was more things wrong ...
neutral	i received an item that was substituted for the one ordered , this item would not work and had to return it for the right one .
neutral	i had to pay the shipping for sending the order back even_though it was partgeeks mistake .
neutral	the whole_experience was genarally good although i did order the goods pre 0 . 0pm friday and they arrived tuesday_afternoon , having payed next working day delivery .
neutral	but you get used to this nowadays
neutral	the service was fast and efficient .
neutral	the customer_support could have been better .

neutral	i was surprised when i discovered that my flight times had changed , and travelocity had not notified me .
neutral	i was also surprised that neither travelocity nor the airline notified me when my flight was cancelled .
neutral	ordered headlamps for 00 e000 ford got two rights no left had to take attaching parts from old lite to make it work
neutral	ive booked many flights and hotels with ebookers .
neutral	alto i find it hassle_free and good prices at the best of times .
neutral	have never being offered any kind of discounts .
neutral	you should get a 0_stars as it relates to doing what you promised .
neutral	the sticks were in good condition and arrived when you said .
neutral	but , i packed my sticks on a saturday in az , they then got picked_up on monday and they didn_'_t arrive in ma till monday the following week .
neutral	not having your clubs for 0 weekends is really not a workable solution .
neutral	did i just miss much more accelerated options .
neutral	some people in my office use others , but i know my club works well with you guys and handles it for me from club garage to location and back .
neutral	i have yet receive my purchase because i am not at home during the day when fedex attempts delivery .
neutral	i was not aware when i made the purchase that i would be required to sign for the equipment .
neutral	supposedly this is a feature orchestrated by the sender ( test_equipment depot ).
neutral	fedex will not leave at my home without signature .
neutral	nor can i get them to leave at fedex hub where i could go by and pick it up .
neutral	very frustrated about the shipping experience .
neutral	don_'_t know when i will get the equipment i ordered .
neutral	ordered a standard secondary hw circulating pump ( grundfos ).
neutral	confirmation by email of order then nothing !
neutral	contacted anchor direct and they seemed to have mislaid email order .
neutral	promised to get back to me within a short time period .
neutral	they didn_'_t !
neutral	after 0 more phone_calls anchor managed to sort the problem and upgraded my delivery ( i had by now waited for 0 days ).
neutral	the pump arrived next_day as_promised .
neutral	would use anchor again
neutral	i would like to see any updates on my report even if is the same score on a monthly bases vs . once every 0 months . thinking about dropping my membership
neutral	i was very pleased with parts_geek and will use them again , good job
neutral	i have emailed springer letting them know that the price on the receipt does not match the price on my american_express bill .
neutral	it '_s a source of grief for my accounting_department every month .
neutral	booked air , hotel and car all easily with good pricing .
neutral	i liked the fact that the hotel could be canceled without_penalty .
neutral	without that assurance i do not usually use travelocity for hotels .
neutral	a couple of days after booking i received an_automated email from travelocity that the airline had changed my flight times and , consequently , rebooked me on inconvenient flights .
neutral	i tried several_times to contact travelocity '_s " 00 / 0 " customer_support to obtain different flights and no one ever answered the phone .
neutral	finally , i had to call the airline_directly .
neutral	i was really pleasantly surprise to see how easy was to order all od my car parts .
neutral	i '_m 00 years , and i had been ordering parts for 00 years .
neutral	meaning that i was very careful when checking what i order , however , two of the four engine_mounts were wrong ???
neutral	the problem was we have then order locally , wasting time in waiting , and i spent two extra days of rent car .
neutral	therefore , i though i was saving around $_00 bucks with the whole order .
neutral	but instead , i ended_up ( 0 ) with 0 days rental $_00 dollrs ( 0 ) having to process the 0 wrong parts to get proper credit .
neutral	plus now to follow_up my debit_card to make_sure the funds are back into my bank_account .
neutral	let '_s see how all these things and handling works out as to give you my expert opinion .
neutral	the tent was described as 0 - 0 person and is 0 - 0 .
neutral	the name of the tent is rab latok base but was subsequently told it is an up the mtn tent ?!?
neutral	no instructions to put it up too !
neutral	having said that they called me personally to sort it out which is cool !
neutral	the site had ' free ' shipping for a certain_amount , but they deduct any coupons from that amount , so it is no_longer ' free ' shipping .
neutral	my $_00 coupon was now only worth $_00 .
neutral	very disappointing .
neutral	what was a cost savings is no more ... i may as well stop at the local supply place on the way home from work .
neutral	de boot had op_een tocht van 0 uur in totaal 0 uur vertraging .
neutral	ook met de terug weg .
neutral	erg lastig voor zakelijke reizigers .
neutral	de_prijs was goedkoop , maar de reistijd hoeft daar niet onder te leiden .
neutral	i ordered just a few chips .
neutral	shipping could be easily done via normal post mail .
neutral	just use a bubblewrap envelope .
neutral	shipping was promt though ,
neutral	all pins on the 00fxxx type chips at the cornes were bent .
neutral	a reason to not order again it it will be the same next time .
neutral	plcc00 chips were in top shape .
neutral	slow delivery .
neutral	ordered on 00 / 00 still have not received it .
neutral	( 00 / 00 ) no updates from company to inform on status ...
neutral	on the website the price shown was £_00 per_night with a total of £_000 . 00 for 0 nights , but when we came to book taxes and fees of £_00 . 00 were added .
neutral	at £_000 we are seriously_considering staying elsewhere .
neutral	in addition the free phone_number was not answered for over 0 hours and only answered when i pressed the numbers for a hotel representative trying to register for business .
neutral	whenever i have booked a hotel , in london or elsewhere , the price shown includes all taxes and fees and they are not added as you enter your card details !
neutral	autoship can be a great service to a buyer , but if i want to cancel the service i should be able to do it the same way i started the service ... online and without making an unecessary phone_call .
neutral	i subscribe to petflow '_s recurring delivery program , and have never had the same products in the box month - over - month .
neutral	every time , something else is missing .
neutral	i like having these things delivered to me , because it provides real convenience , but the supply_chain is completely random , which defeats the purpose .
neutral	the service is very good , but sommetimes the delievery
neutral	is to long .
neutral	we haven_'_t received the cards yet ... so cannot give you a full review at this time .
neutral	i am a long time user of travelocity and like the service .
neutral	there is a problem , however , my upcoming trips have stopped showing up in my account .
neutral	my history is still there but not my upcoming trips .
neutral	i actually called about the problem but the help_desk could not help me .
neutral	please contact me before i move to another service .
neutral	000 000 0000 or mike . mcnamara @ greerwalker . com thanks
neutral	i decided to give your company one more try because you do have good prices !
neutral	the last time i purchased a few items i got burned with the wrong part .
neutral	it was listed wrong and i emailed back 0 times trying to get the sales_person to see the mistake !
neutral	all 0 times i was greeted with ( you ordered the wrong part , please pay the shipping and send it back for a refund ) i can '_t pay the shipping both_ways when its not my fault !
neutral	the part was listed wrong , later someone finally understood what i was telling them , the part had the wrong number on it .
neutral	00_hours_later the mistake was corrected on your parts list , but i still wasn_'_t satified with the wrong part i received and i ; m not going to pay the shipping to send it back because it easn '_t my mistake .
neutral	the parts i have order right now , if they arrive in good order that will be great because i saved a lot of money !
neutral	but if this happens again i will have to go back to the other company i have been doing_business with !
neutral	i have never been more pleased with my purchase thanks so much and i will make another order soon .
neutral	i got my part in a reasonable enough time , not lightning_fast , at the door 0 days_later like some places , but not unacceptably slow either , and the price was good compared to others i found on the net .
neutral	my only issue it is that it '_s a very poor color match to my trucks interior .
neutral	i have a 00 yukon with tan interior and this door_handle is a much darker color .
neutral	almost brown .
neutral	its sort of in that in between zone where i '_m not sure if it '_s just a poor color match by a cheep chinese part , or if it '_s actually the wrong color meant to match a different color interior .
neutral	i '_m leaning with cheep chinese part since i '_ve never seen that particular color in another yukon interior , but i may be wrong .
neutral	aside from the color the part looks_like it will work fine .
neutral	i care more about function than form in this particular rig , but if this was my other vehicle i ' d send it back .
neutral	i won_'_t be able to judge the quality vs . stock until i get the old one out .
neutral	we paid 000_euro to pick_up a car in munich and drop it off in rome .
neutral	interesting since the car was registered in italy and we were returning it to its native land .
neutral	we rented a car in florida ( usa ) one time and dropped it off in new_york ( usa ).
neutral	we were only charge $_00 for the whole 0_weeks rental because we were returning a car to its desired location .
neutral	live and learn .
neutral	carrietta lumia
neutral	when i ordered these suitcases , it was because i needed them , sooner rather_than later .
neutral	i do accept some of the responsibility , since i waited to order them until about 00 days prior to the need .
neutral	however , it took 0 days from my order being placed to them having been shipped .
neutral	they were allegedly in stock .
neutral	only 0 days from date of shipping to delivery .
neutral	i have ordered off this site before , everything has_been fine but i ordered a battlefield bad company 0 cd_key and sadly its not working :(
neutral	all of my seeds except the two free seeds were immature and are not brown color ..... they were very white i would really like it if they were brown but shipping speed are great next time i hopefully i get regular colored seeds
neutral	onnit has great products at reasonable pricing .
neutral	my personal favorite are the tpc packs , definitely one of the premium supplement packs on the market .
neutral	however they ran_out stock on of this product sometime 0st quarter .
neutral	i was continually reassured that the product would be back in stock but weeks turned into months & it didn_'_t happen .
neutral	i sent a request to purchase the individual supplements at the same rate of discount as the packs but was denied .
neutral	finally , a week_later , the packs came back on the market ; i purchased a two month supply .
neutral	i am a fan of onnit & especially tpc however i like to stay consistent with my supplements .
neutral	if i had to endure the same waiting game again it is doubtful that i would continue use of this supplement .
neutral	i had a question concerning the proper part for my car there were two options listed on their web_site but only one would be the correct part .
neutral	i tried to get through on several ( 0 ) different occassions but was prompted and waited upwards of 0 minutes each of three_times ( over a three day period ) and a recorded_message came on each time saying the phone agents were essentially overwhelmed and to leave a message but there was no way that allowed this user to leave a message .
neutral	finally , i simply tossed a coin and luckly the heads was the right call .
neutral	great prices though willing to deal with the lack of phone agents .
neutral	if you order without the aide of a live agent it ; s seemless .
neutral	i absolutely can '_t communicate with them .
neutral	i '_ve emailed 0 times , called twice , and faxed once .
neutral	no reply .
neutral	i didn_'_t even know that my order for a bosch_starter had gone_through until it arrived .
neutral	now i need to return the core , but can '_t get the instruction ( i '_m supposed to email for ) to return it .
neutral	this will be a great deal .... if i don_'_t get stuck with the $_00 . 00 core_charge .
neutral	is anybody there ?
neutral	i accepted the first increase .
neutral	this latest is over $_00 /_mo .
neutral	i will be moving out asap .
neutral	used_usrentacar may times always give good service & price but this time they have been let_down by the us supplier budget at tampa .
neutral	booked car not available kept getting offered upgrades i did not want .
neutral	then told only had premium_rate or 0 door compacts available when i should have had a 0 dr intermediate .
neutral	after 00_hrs of travelling i just wanted to get to bed and eventually agreed a $_00 a day upgrade to a ford_escape suv after declining attempts to get me to agree up to $_00 a day upgrades .
neutral	only got this after manager heard me say i would put this on internet .
neutral	why should i be expected to pay for an upgrade if the hirer has not got my class of vehicle available .
neutral	travelled to usa many_times , always used_usrentacar + budget .
neutral	will_continue to use usrentacar but budget - never again .
neutral	we were looking_forward to our new bed .
neutral	when it arrived some boxes were damaged and one box was open at one end .
neutral	the delivery came when we were out so a neighbour took the delivery .
neutral	we took the boxes to our bedroom and opened them up and took out all of the contents in preparation to build the bed .
neutral	it was at that time we noticed that there were no fixings so we had no means of putting the bed together .
neutral	having talked to the sales_staff they were quick to help resolve the issue and the bed is up and fine .
neutral	multitrip were very helpful - they had automatically renewed my policy , but included business and golf travel , which i didn_'_t want this year .
neutral	rather_than take it off , they found it easier to cancel my poilicy and renew , which they did without_fuss .
neutral	i wanted to add south_africa to my european cover for a two - week holiday .
neutral	the good news here was that it was much_cheaper to cover for a year than a one - off policy .
neutral	all very helpful up to now .
neutral	they then told me to renew my details for pre_- existng health conditions , which i thought a little over zealous , as nothing had changed from last_year .
neutral	but pre_- existing conditions are covered by a separate company , which had changed since last_year .
neutral	although no symptoms had appeared in the year , the new company went through the vetting process and then said " thank_you very much , that will be £_00 please ".
neutral	my only options at this stage were either not to be covered for those conditions or cancel the policy and start the whole_process again , which i find a poor procedure - this figure should be known well before taking out the policy .
neutral	je_ne suis pas spécialement satisfait car la pièce que_j ' ai_commandé était en stock sur votre site puis j ' ai_reçu un appel me disant qu ' elle ne l ' était pas il à fallu payer 00 € de plus .
neutral	puis vous deviez livrer en 00 h j ' ai_reçu ma pièce en retard alors que_le payement était fait .
neutral	je referais une commande peut être par la suite je verrais si cela est une généralité ou pas sur votre site .
neutral	si non pour_le_prix c ' est super le produit est_bien arrivé et_bien emballé .
neutral	the website is easier to use than many auto_parts web sites .
neutral	i bought a few_hundred_dollars worth of parts ; everything was delivered on time .
neutral	however , before spending a few_hundred_dollars more on a /_c parts , i asked for some clarification on the compatibility among the parts i am intending to buy .
neutral	a week_later , i '_m still_waiting for an answer to that question .
neutral	support_ticket 000000 , if anyone is listening ...
neutral	fortunately it was fine weather by the time we had completed the paperwork required to actually load ourselves and or luggage into the hire car as it was some distance from the airport building to where the car was parked .
neutral	had it been been otherwise i do not see how we could have got ourselves and our_luggage into the vehicle without one of us having to extract wet_weather gear from our baggage .
neutral	rockhampton seemed to be better laid_out in this respect .
neutral	bought a couple coax cables that were represented by a picture that was not the same as item received .
neutral	not as much monthly info on credit and credit_score monitoring as i would like for the price .
neutral	i have found a better replacement online .
neutral	we had purchased our tour tickets on line expecting the prices that were advertised for internet purchases .
neutral	we were disappointed to find , however , that we paid the regular price .
neutral	an e_-_mail to the company complaining and asking for a refund of the difference went_unanswered .
neutral	the tour itself was very good .
neutral	we used as a way of seeing the whole city and to save our feet when we needed a rest .
neutral	the boat_tour and walking_tours were good value added .
neutral	i not happy with the letters being on the out side of the window and the shaded part was to be gray not bright silver , also there was a fold in it .
neutral	not happy pete mazzei
neutral	i have recently purchsed a prd for my shower , it was delivered fast . i looked on gainsboroughs website after i made the purchase and found the same part for half the price . dont expect an independent retailer to be dewarer than the manufacturer . i will always check before i make another purchase .
neutral	priceline . com provides great deals .
neutral	i would like priceline . com to allow a bid on a hotel to be changeable solely by changing the price and not as they have it set_up now , which requires changing the price and star_rating when one re - bids after one '_s initial bid is rejected .
neutral	this is to say that priceline requires the bidder to bid the same amount for a lower - starred hotel as they had just bid for a higher - starred hotel .
neutral	.. waiting for 00 - 00_minutes while other company has multiple cars going by is ridiculous !
neutral	especially when my flight itself was 0 . 0hrs .
neutral	good choice of products , easy order and quick delivery - usually 00 - 00 days , but the package arrived in 0 days from order ( from uk to slovakia ).
neutral	i ordered the hunter instant boot shine and hunter boot buffer .
neutral	the bad_experience was that all goods including the invoice were dirty and greasy from the product .
neutral	and the stickers on the products were damaged .
neutral	i ordered the goods as gift , so this was quite negative to find out .
neutral	i know we can blame the mail service but this shouldn ´ t happen .
neutral	it took three tries to book a multi destination flight .
neutral	on my first attempt , flighthub reported that the price had increased substantially from the original_quote and gave_me the option to cancel .
neutral	i was skeptical , but cancelled and made a second attempt with different flights .
neutral	however , when tried to book those , i was informed that one or more of the flights were no_longer available .
neutral	really frustrated , but determined , i made a third attempt and was able to find suitable flights and actually book them .
neutral	although , everything worked out in the end , having to enter traveller details and credit_card information each time did get pretty old .
neutral	we were delighted to stay in a nice clean milford hotel_room right in the theatre district in new_york city .
neutral	our " surprize " cost
neutral	us an_additional roundtrip for two cost of $_000 . 00 each because we thought that we were leaving atlanta at 0 : 00 am only to discover that our travelocity tickets said 0 : 00_pm .
neutral	the same occurred when we were returning from nyc to atlanta .
neutral	thus we paid overall an_additional $_000 . 00 .
neutral	we were not happy with the time confusion !
neutral	!
neutral	... and never contacted me .
neutral	my bank had to notify me , which was not a fun experience .
neutral	could have ended worse , but i wish zappos would have taken this hacking issue a little more seriously .
neutral	when people describe someone_else as " peaked " just think of how popular myspace was , and how quickly it died by allowing people to make their own pages look like crap .
neutral	great example of not thinking smart , and giving people everything they want without long_term planning .
neutral	the washing_machine supplied is very noisy when the machine is in spin cycle , this is the only disappointing function so_far
neutral	interface is still inferior to airbnb , however .
neutral	also users in brazil generally have no experience with such sites and are very unreliable .
neutral	parts great packing lousy .
neutral	parts were falling out of box when arrived .
neutral	lucky they weren_'_t destroyed
neutral	refer to the 00 , 000 and 00 , 000 lire commandest my mails since le00 gilbert . errada @ wanadoo . fr / / 00 / 0000 assitenza , stefano and steve adv very good contact for customers who follow you recovered has lost potential clients because delivery times too_long , produced in error , double_check before shipping_label without la . mais i think i stop being more vigilant when their problems are a little better service worthy of the name , so i would remain one of your loyal_customers has venir . gilbert errada
neutral	mounted , balanced , and aligned for the price quoted online and out the door in under an_hour .
neutral	slight wobble at high speed on first trip which could be a balance issue or just the brand_new tires being brand_new .
neutral	so for now i give full_marks .
neutral	update_: went back , had tires re - balanced .
neutral	much_better , not sure if it '_s 000_% yet though .
neutral	took about an_hour to get done .
neutral	bag of dog_food had two small holes at the opening .
neutral	i am betting it is due to delivery , and will keep it , but makes me feel uneasy .
neutral	i booked with thrifty because they offered a subaru liberty .
neutral	i thought i had booked and paid for a subaru liberty , my confirmation was for a subaru liberty , i didn_'_t end up with a subaru liberty
neutral	website is easy to use .
neutral	they usually deliver on time but my last 0 times were not good .
neutral	i emailed asking to move up delivery by 0 week and they never answered and then last delivery was 0 week late .
neutral	received part in a timely manneer .
neutral	it fit_perfectly .
neutral	the grill i ordered was great but the 0 lights i ordered were the same .
neutral	there is a left and right one , but i got 0 right side lights .
neutral	it '_s not your fault though , the boxes are marked right
neutral	i asked for the cheapest unit for about 0 months that was driving to ct to get my stuff out of my other public_storage in manchester ct and that i was upsizing and finally rejoining my space .
neutral	she gave_me a unit with two doors .
neutral	i specifically_asked if i only needed the one lock she said yes .
neutral	about 00 to 00 days_later i was called by another property_manager saying my unit wasn_'_t locked .
neutral	well i was furious came up there and it was they just wanted me to spend another 00 dollars to pay for a lock for the other door .
neutral	i wasn_'_t happy about this at all .
neutral	not good service .
neutral	the only individual i had any contact with was quite abrupt on the phone issuing orders as though talking to a toddler .
neutral	he was late when we arrived at the airport , even_though he instructed us to ring when we were only 00_minutes away and i '_m sure that my drivers door now has an extra ding , though i cant prove it .
neutral	would not use them again .
neutral	really happy with the product but not happy with the salesman .
neutral	he was more interested in selling us the add -_ons .. 0 year_warranty as there '_s a chance that the wood will split !!
neutral	( really ) wanted us to pay around £_00 to arrange delivery as the free delivery offered wasn_'_t very flexible , we didn_'_t want to pay the £_00 so took our chance with the free option and had a call that very same day offering us 0 timeslots ..
neutral	the delivery people were also very good ..
neutral	i would only shop there again if i dealt_with a different salesperson ..
neutral	when looking for i hotel i did look a on a number of websites to try and get the best deal , and with searching i found this site and it was very easy to use & well layed_out a d i thought i got the best deal that was available so booked my hotel , but that was not the case , on arriving at my hotel i met up with a colleague_who was attending the same course as me , he told me that he used a different website & was staying in the same hotel but he got breakfast included & was also £_00 cheaper_than from booking on this site , so i was alittle dissapointed .
neutral	other than that all in all a good experience
neutral	the gps was a pos .
neutral	it often could not find things , was amazing clunky to use and frustrating .
neutral	car_rental went without a hitch .
neutral	the 0000_pontiac g0 passenger - side_rear - view_mirror that i ordered did not fit on my 0000_pontiac g0 .
neutral	i had to use self - tapping screws to create new holes because the one partsgeek sent me did not have the holes in the correct position and the frame of the mirror itself was much larger than the original that i removed .
neutral	your prices are the best , however trying to make phone contact is sorely lacking .
neutral	i have waited on hold for 00_minutes and finally gave up .
neutral	also you never sent me any confirmation on whether you had shipped some of my parts .
neutral	i did finally receive my parts .
neutral	you need to improve your customer communications !
neutral	the part i ordered was delivered timely .
neutral	it did however stopped_working after a few_days .
neutral	i am still_waiting to hear from customer service .
neutral	also there was a core_charge .
neutral	i sent my part back to you but not as_described in your email .
neutral	my error but hopefully you can help me with that as well as the part failure issue .
neutral	i look_forward to hearing from you .
neutral	paul p .
neutral	it seems like i got sent a " returned " pair because that '_s exactly why i returned my first pair , for the same crack in the hinge .
neutral	karma ...
neutral	fast shipping on a low quality part already paid to have installed so i would not buy from them again pay a little more .
neutral	i ordered a rear_mech hanger for my malt 0 , with quick friendly service , but the wrong hanger was delivered , and when i called they said my bike must be an_older version which was different .
neutral	i hadn_'_t known there were different versions and they hadn_'_t asked the age of the bike .
neutral	i asked for a return_label as it had been their error .
neutral	the correct hanger then arrived but no return_label , but i sent the first hanger back anyway at a cost of 00p as it was no use to me ...
neutral	i like myprotein .
neutral	good products and easy website .
neutral	very speedy_delivery , but only if you use parcel_force .
neutral	the default courier is dpd which is just terrible .
neutral	unfortunately they don_'_t always pay_attention to who you specify for the courier .
neutral	and then you '_ll get into a bizarre conversation with their customer_services who can '_t understand that dpd are the worst couriers in the world if you have a job , and won_'_t dispatch to you using the one you specified !
neutral	annoying .
neutral	i got my order of best ubiquinol 000_mg 00 soft gels .
neutral	you didn_'_t have my wifes which was to be000 mg soft gels .
neutral	you said you would email me .
neutral	i don_'_t understand_why you don_'_t have it yet .
neutral	nice site providing a great product , but it was somewhat_confusing when i was trying to place my order .
neutral	when i felt i completed my order i expected to receive and order confirmation via_email to my email address .
neutral	that didn_'_t happen and receiving this feedback request is the only_thing i received that indicated my order had been placed .
neutral	the facility has minimal security , but the attendant was courteous and helpful .
neutral	the attendant said they perform routine lock checks , which is good .
neutral	they have a few cameras , but the fences at the back of the property would be easy to defeat .
neutral	in
neutral	addition , there is drive - up access to the back of the property , which would provide
neutral	undetected access and an easy get - away route during hours the attendant is not on duty .
neutral	the service is very good , delivery , promptness all good .
neutral	the down_side was the 0 items i had ordered totaled £ 0 . 00 , the final cost incl .
neutral	postage and vat = £_00 . 00 , a bit of a false sense of cost when first entering the website .
neutral	parts_geek consistently_provides competitive_pricing .
neutral	i often have trouble identifying the correct part on your website because you do not reference the manufacturers part number .
neutral	this creates the need to cross_reference parts_geek '_s number with the manufacturers number before i place my order .
neutral	parts_geek requires that i contact their customer service by e_-_mail .
neutral	their policy is to provide a response in 00 - 00_hours .
neutral	normally i receive a response in 00_hours but sometimes it takes longer .
neutral	if i need to repair a car i can not wait an_additional 00_hours so i have to order the part elsewhere .
neutral	i would prefer being_able to communicate with someone immediately when i have questions about a part , so i could buy more parts from pg or the better solution to this issue for pg would be to provide the manufacturers sku or part number .
neutral	this would minimize their customer service expenses and would improve the accurracy of the customer '_s order .
neutral	this would minimize the expenses incurred when customer '_s return parts .
neutral	partsgeek . com shipped my replacement part very quickly , however it wasn_'_t the part that was advertised .
neutral	it still worked , however it was of inferior quality that i was expecting .
neutral	now , my problem is fixed , however had i known the part i ordered was of lower quality i would have spent more money on a different one .
neutral	they couldnt match the price from another site , and then a huge argument with the the customer service , with threats of closing account .
neutral	ended with a ordered game , but a bad_experience .
neutral	i was expecting my order to be delivered 0 - 0 business days .
neutral	after 0 days i called to see where my part was .
neutral	the woman_who answered informed me they were out of stock .
neutral	i wish they would have informed me sooner .
neutral	you see those hiddens items on my credit_report that are blocking to fix my credit .
neutral	they have been there those items for a period of time .
neutral	but identity_guard has good prices for their servces .
neutral	better coordination between barrington and city_link - used for deliveries would avoid the hassle we experienced having advised a ' do not deliver before date ' that was totally_ignored .
neutral	added expense for barrington to sort it and a spate of unnecessary e_-_mails .
neutral	otherwise very good service .
neutral	everything was fine but don_'_t expect to ever speak to anyone .
neutral	phone # goes nowhere .
neutral	email only .
neutral	i made a flight change and was told about a $_000 fee .
neutral	i was also instructed that since i paid for insurance that if i filed a claim i would be reimbursed .
neutral	this weighted heavily in my decision to change my flight .
neutral	i felt lied to and misguided .
neutral	now i will be financial liable for those fees .
neutral	very disappointed that i was not speaking with a travel expert .
neutral	i will use a different booking service next time which will be in a few weeks .
neutral	i had a discount_coupon and that '_s the only reason i tried this site over competitor pet_food sites i '_ve used before .
neutral	but even with that discount , i still got hit with higher shipping_charges and the starting price of the dog_food i buy was higher as well .
neutral	the product shipped fairly quickly , but again , i '_ve had quicker shipping with other_sites .
neutral	overall , i had no_problems so i can '_t say anything bad .
neutral	all i can say is i '_ve had better experiences ordering from other pet_food sites .
neutral	the website is good , but after i had ordered there was a break down in communication which led to me having to chase up my order by phone and email several_times .
neutral	the trophy was delivered finally and is exactly how i wanted so i '_m happy .
neutral	that quality of the work is great just wish there was a faster way to place a order they usally take about a week to review my artwork befor i can even place a order .
neutral	once im approved to pay it ships fast which is good .
neutral	also i provided ther vector file in 00x00 layout and still charged a $_00 artwork fee don_'_t understand_why im getting charge this fee if the artwork is ready .
neutral	i would only order 0 color print do to the prices to add a another color leaves me no room for profit .
neutral	your prices for a 0 color transfer are good just wish you offered more reasonable pricing like other transfer sites
neutral	smart : jeg klikker på_en knap og_der_kommer en taxa .
neutral	jeg bliver transporteret derhen hvor_jeg_skal og turen betales automatisk via app ' en uden at jeg_skal foretage mig noget_som_helst .
neutral	dumt : app ' en har registreret en slutadresse der ligger længere væk en der hvor_jeg stod af , og turen blev derfor 00kr dyrere end der stod på taxameteret .
neutral	måske har chaufføren snydt .
neutral	jeg aner det_ikke for jeg_har ingen mulighed for at godkende betalingen i app ' en eller vælge at betale kontant , og_når_jeg_får kvitteringen på mail er taxaen allerede over alle bjerge .
neutral	need to go to t0 at_heathrow but the search came out with all the available car parking .
neutral	we booked for the cheapest one but only found out later that they won_'_t drop us at t0 .
neutral	it would be good if the search_engine would let us search for the terminal as well as the airport .
neutral	otherwise it '_s the cheapest car parking site i can find .
neutral	i bought a ticket $ 0000 based on the marketing message " best price guaranteed ".
neutral	the trip was for almost 0m0 / 0 my fault .
neutral	i had in mind i can '_t go_wrong .
neutral	i '_ve checked before and see price for about $_000 less .
neutral	well , few_days_later , i '_ve checked and see the price was back to about $_000 .
neutral	i called the customer and try to get the difference back .
neutral	so first , got answer within the few_minutes ( hence the 0_stars ).
neutral	the person explained me that the best price guaranteed is only for the very exact_same flight - not with different airline - and within the same 00 - 00hours .
neutral	so something i got from other travel_agency already like travelocity ( they charged me $ 0 - 0 something plus_tax ) or sometime free .
neutral	most of the time , i read terms and conditions .
neutral	just taht i was too_busy ..
neutral	i ordered a borderlands_0 key and got it almost_instantly !
neutral	a few hours_later after bragging to a friend about it , he decided he wanted one two .
neutral	he tried to setup everything , but in the end he got bogged down in all the anti_- fraud_protection .
neutral	so , he sent me the money , and i ordered one for him .
neutral	all of a sudden , i got hit with the same anti_- fraud crap .
neutral	this is after i successfully completed an order .
neutral	you need a picture of my id ?
neutral	seriously ?
neutral	i '_m using paypal .
neutral	they have consumer / merchant protection built in .
neutral	even after complying to this ridiculous request , it still took over 00_hours to get my key .
neutral	oh , and to top it all off , they didn_'_t cancel my friend '_s first order as he requested , so he ended_up with two keys instead of one .
neutral	maybe now that everything is setup , i won_'_t have this issue anymore , but it was really a pain getting to this point .
neutral	i '_m likely to give them another chance in the future , but if this happens again , i '_ll start going somewhere_else .
neutral	though this product has not yet been installed i am impressed with the quality of the product .
neutral	the packaging is another issue .
neutral	all the products came in on record time but , three of the four packages were damaged and the products inside had various amounts of damage .
neutral	i ordered the product for my grandsons birthday but when the package arrived the product had just been put into a plastic_bag with no protection and the box the item arrived in was crushed and broken .
neutral	i sent an_email to kiddis kingdom about it but never recieved a response . as i paid about £ 0 . 00 postage / packing i was not impressed .
neutral	bought a 00 foot round solar_cover , good price , advertisement said purchase over $_000 , shipping is free .
neutral	ooohh wait , but handling is still 0 . 00 .
neutral	gotcha !
neutral	most people would think free shipping is free shipping and handling , so i would have to go with a little_bit of sleazy advertisement .
neutral	i have ordered 0 times now from parts_geek and it has_been great .
neutral	the only part i had this time is that i got charged and extra $_00 . 00 for some kind of insurance or shipping stuff that i did not ordered and another $_00 . 00 to my account for free shipping witch i already got charge my $ 0 . 00 shipping for for the wiper i ordered .
neutral	i got my $_00 . 00 returned and the lady was very apologetic , but when i called the number for the $_00 . 00 a month for free shipping , the man said that it was too_late , and that i had signed in for it .
neutral	mind you if said if you want to join the club for free shipping , click here .
neutral	no were did i see that i would have to pay an extra $_00 . 00 a month for shipping when both_times that i have ordered i got charge $ 0 . 00 .
neutral	and all of these charges came out of my account without me knowing .
neutral	i told the gentlemen that i spoke with that i would not do buissness with parts_geek . com anymore if this is the way that they would treat their customers .
neutral	for that reason i only rated a 0_star , other wise it would have been a 0_star .
neutral	sincerely , william mendenhall
neutral	i '_ve gotten some good parts at good prices , and i '_ve gotten some parts that were good , but were not the right ones for my vehicle and they do not cover return shipping .
neutral	anybody need a set of brake_pads ?
neutral	i don_'_t know what vehicle they are for , just that they aren_'_t for the car i specified and i '_m not paying shipping to return them .
neutral	glad i didn_'_t have to return the rotors !
neutral	ordered a garden sofa set for dellivery last friday ( 0 days after i ordered ).
neutral	phoned up and was told that the courier had lost the sofa set and couldn_'_t locate it .
neutral	they promised to phone on monday to confirm delivery - they didn_'_t .
neutral	phoned the next_day , and item was out of stock , and couldn_'_t meet my delivery requirements .
neutral	alternatives were offered , but ended_up in a cancelled order and the item supplied by another company .
neutral	refund was made and received quickly .
neutral	the people were fantastic , the product was good but the website is mediocre at best .
neutral	the design function was easy to use but i created a label before i set_up an account and when i set_up my account it erased my work , then after i recreated my label and put the it in the cart i wasn_'_t able to view it again before i purchased .
neutral	after i fulfilled my purchase my login and password didn_'_t work so i wasn_'_t able to see the shipping timing or purchase additional labels .
neutral	i was able to connect with a sales_rep that was very polite and helpful .
neutral	[_name ] was the saving_grace for the company .
neutral	i bougt two transmision line and one .
neutral	of them was broke . and take to long on be frlivery .
neutral	we purchased a tour from london to paris , including a visit to the eiffel_tower .
neutral	we were not informed until arrival that due to logistical reasons , the tour would exclude visiting the tower .
neutral	marginally satisfied
neutral	ordered part works great & price was good ; but your shipping method & timeliness definitely could use improvement .
neutral	took a while to get the ok from mazuma about the goods
neutral	it is cheaper_than nespresso but only 0 coffee can compare in terms of flavour - dark strong .
neutral	quality is questionable at times , perhaps at times , it has to do with the cell_phone system in the philippines .
neutral	many dropped_calls .
neutral	lost minutes recently when the ring changed on the other end of my call .
neutral	ran_out of minutes thanksgiving day and had to wait_until the next_day to renew .
neutral	the offers of extra minutes usually come to me after i have added a lot of minutes to my account .
neutral	good price easy to use end_result v good but , you failed to tell the garage i was coming , they got you out of " it " though .
neutral	ken higgins
neutral	the prices were good but the service was just ok . not very professional and took quit a long time .
neutral	longer then i thought .
neutral	also the warehouse were customers wait was quit cold .
neutral	first time i came in they were all eating fast food behind the counter n in the area .
neutral	nice product , poor quality control , however will use company again
neutral	there were two translation mistakes .
neutral	the title was wrongly translated as certificate of marriage when it should be certificate of birth and the time i was born was translated as 0 : 00 and not 0 : 00 ( 00 : 00 ).
neutral	rev did correct the problem promptly , though , but i wonder what could have happened if i didn_'_t speak_english !
neutral	the interface and selection of restaurants is good .
neutral	some participating restaurants not available on seamless .
neutral	don_'_t like how the delivery minimum is set to the subtotal .
neutral	on seamless , i like that i can add extra tip to make the order reach the minimum and therefore not order extra items just to reach it on top of the appropriate tip .
neutral	i do like the point system though , even_though it takes some time to accumulate .
neutral	i like the easy way to book flights and hotels , it can be done comfortable from home .
neutral	but i hate that i get charged with a fee when i pay by my credit_card ( master card ).
neutral	therefore , ebookers is for me only 0nd choice , whenever_possible i look for a way to book at a company that does not punish credit_card holders , e . g .
neutral	i first look at swiss airline or other airlines , they do not charge any fees .
neutral	part wasnt the same bucket was slightly_different and would not line up correctly but i used my original bucket and worked out ok i was surprised when a second exact part was left on door_step packaging was terrible and part could of easily fell out due to big hole in box box was all chewed up and dusty must of been sitting for ages headlight_assembly ring was missing a screw so now i have to repack it in new box so it wont get damaged or else i would of refused order and shipped it back so could you please_let_me know how to return this unused part do i need a rma_# and i do need a shipping_label since i never ordered the same part twice thank_you mistakes_happen but i do want to get this part back safely to you guys dont want to be responsible for any damages ...
neutral	disappointing that within the last order of 0 bags of dog_food , 0 bags were split & contents spilled in the box .
neutral	i ordered a radiator_fan_assembly from you and unfortunately when i opened the package it had been damaged and cracked during shipping .
neutral	i immediately sent an_email to customer service and a return email was promptly sent the next_day .
neutral	personally i know it would probably raise the cost but i would like to speak to someone in person when there is a problem .
neutral	having to send an_email makes it seem as though you don_'_t really care .
neutral	when i now know that is not the case .
neutral	luckily , i was able to swap the fans out of the new housing and into the old housing and " problem averted ".
neutral	so the customer service was great , but i think the experience could be better with a phone_call and an " american " on the other end .
neutral	thanks smylingt , jackson , tn
neutral	great products .
neutral	suppose they could be a bit quicker delivering it though
neutral	it hurts ya ' know .
neutral	my first time with this group and now hurt because i went blindly into and bad out come .. would like them to make things right because i am almost certain a company this big would most certainly have shipping insurance to insure buyers will come_back .
neutral	good service to pick_up at door and drop_off at destination , but the delivery service damaged my new hard travel case , now as a problem for me i have to gothrough a process to get it replaced .
neutral	what a pain in the -- as !
neutral	!
neutral	although i was generally pleased with the attention i received as i was purchasing my tires , i was less satisfied once i came to pick my up .
neutral	after purchasing four new tires , i found the low_pressure alert still engaged on my dashboard .
neutral	nobody at town_fair had informed me of any_issues , so i had to turn_around and ask them to take a look at it .
neutral	when i finally got somebody '_s attention , he told me i would have to now purchase a new sensor for one of the tires and wait up to three hours to install it .
neutral	so after paying close to thousand_dollars on tires , waiting about four hours to get them put on , i now somehow lost my place in line and have to spend more money .
neutral	not exactly_what one would expect from a five year - old car with brand_new tires .
neutral	price was good but i was very put off by a 00 euro " airport pickup fee ," which should be made very clear when one is purchasing the rental not afterwards .
neutral	since autoeurope is just a brokerage , the actual rental was through europcar , who is also terrible .
neutral	i was given the option of 000_euros for insurance ( which is a preposterous price for a 0 day rental ) or a 0000 euro hold on my car , which is insane .
neutral	in the end things worked out although i paid $_00 more than what i was quoted .
neutral	i will not be using autoeurope again as i will stick with companies like hertz and thrifty who i '_ve had luck with .
neutral	have not received part yet .
neutral	ordered 00 + days ago .
neutral	took 0 days to ship , and tracking_information given was invalid .
neutral	great price , but the parts i ordered from other online_retailers , day after ordering from parts_geek , are already here .
neutral	still_waiting .
neutral	i was concerned in that i never received any email_notifications the order was received or shipped .
neutral	a simple email would have given me the confidence the product was on its way .
neutral	the product was great and delivered as_promised but more notice would be a nice feature .
neutral	the agent knew little or nothing about the available rooms beyond what was on the web_site .
neutral	simple questions , such as whether the sofa_bed in the room was a double , queen , king sized , were not clearly answered , if at all .
neutral	that example actually fall back on the hotel for not providing the information either on their web_site ( and why not ?)
neutral	or easily available to the telephone agents .
neutral	i was told that i was very fortunate to book the last 0 room available at the hotel for that weekend , however i have several cousins also staying at the same hotel , and when they spoke to the reservation service earlier in the week and in the week prior they were also told that they were fortunate to have booked the last available rooms for that weekend .
neutral	along with the over booking (?)
neutral	issues i was surprised that room reservations have a no - cancellation_policy , made even > 0_weeks in advance , and the guest will lose their entire room fee if the reservations is cancelled for any reason .
neutral	in my travel experience , hotels rarely need to have a no cancelation policy and keep the entire room fee unless it is located in a sketchy area , which eden prairie mn is not .
neutral	if the hotel is actually booked solid as the agent said told me and several of my cousins , then marriott is making out like bandits with double , triple , or greater over - payments for rooms .
neutral	ultimately my complaints are primarily with the hotel and not the reservation service :
neutral	0 .
neutral	why does marriott have a no cancelation policy in eden prairie mn in the 00st_century ?
neutral	0 .
neutral	why doesn ’ t the hotel publish the size of the sleeper sofa in the rooms ( single , double , queen , king )?
neutral	0 .
neutral	why doesn ’ t the hotel make room reservation fulfillment clear to the reservation service ?
neutral	0 .
neutral	why doesn ’ t the reservation service have the knowledge , or investigate to learn the answers , regarding room amenities ?
neutral	it took 0 days to get my order .
neutral	i ordered on friday_evening and received the part the following saturday .
neutral	a coworker of mine ordered on wednesday after my order and received his product the same day i did .
neutral	fedex smart - post was terrible at posting the tracking history , as the item made its journey across the us .
neutral	from sacramento to charlotte there was no postings .
neutral	i filed a a report with parts_geek from the recommendation of fedex , due to no postings in 0 days time .
neutral	then 0 days_later they update the tracking to charlotte .
neutral	your company cancel my order and refunded my money but no reason was was forth comming as to why .
neutral	overall , good experience .... don_'_t appreciate the fact that when order was placed it showed my 0 parts being shipped from 0 warehouses , but in fact they were shipped from 0 warehouses in a total of 0 boxes , yet they charged me as if they shipped three boxes .
neutral	0nd item in the one box was very light .
neutral	should not have been charged 0 times .
neutral	i don_'_t appreciated being gamed .
neutral	:(
neutral	great service , offers 0 $ off $_00 nearly every weekend and other savings through the e_-_mail blasts .
neutral	could use more restaurants !
neutral	chauffeur who met us on day we left was ok - polite and pleasant , but no trolley or help given with cases .
neutral	other meet and greet suppliers have had a trolley to hand and unloaded cases for us and been very helpful .
neutral	chauffeur who met us on arrival back was surlly and very unhelpful .
neutral	went to a different car_park , did not help load cases into car and we fet we were being difficult arriving late at night , and as our flight was delayed so it was through no fault of ours although it was a late evening arrival .
neutral	felt threatened by late charge emails before they should have even been thought about !!!
neutral	does not make for a friendly customer relationship ..
neutral	we ordered office supplies on monday_afternoon and didn_'_t receive our order until friday_afternoon .
neutral	in comparison with other online office supply companies we received our order the next_day .
neutral	product was partially defective , but was installed anyway due to the cost of turnaround .
neutral	not pleased
neutral	ordering was ok , sales and confirmation fine .
neutral	while waiting for part to arrive had questions .
neutral	unable to get thru to live_person .
neutral	tried repeatedly .
neutral	part arrived with piece broken .
neutral	again tried to contact
neutral	p . g .
neutral	no luck
neutral	was able to use parts although some things were missing
neutral	this website was cool and full if information , but it has_been offline for a while .
neutral	very disappointing .
neutral	the bag arrived torn_open .
neutral	about 00_% spilled out into the box .
neutral	satisfied with the end product but you have to wait along time for your order .
neutral	it takes 00 days to manufacture the glasses plus more time for shipping depending_on what option you choose .
neutral	after ordering i found my frames for a lower price somewhere_else but couldn_'_t apply their price match as i had used a 00_%_off for my lenses , it '_s one or the other .
neutral	service was great though and the optician who helped_me was very nice .
neutral	be using it again !
neutral	yes lovely curtains .
neutral	i thought they were expensive and very slow delivery , for a couple of net_curtains .
neutral	i am pleased with them however !
neutral	i ordered four parts , everything fine except one oxygen_sensor wrong , probably my fault .
neutral	was able to get exchanged , so_far so good , all parts worked_fine .
neutral	now , my beef .
neutral	they have no phone_number , you must go through a madding e_-_mail procedure to contact them .
neutral	they also seemingly only let you contact them twice , go figure .
neutral	their representative did call me back and was helpful , but again , no phone_number , what '_s up with that .
neutral	it also seems that even if they make a mistake you ' re stuck for postage .
neutral	hey guy '_s , get an 000 number , it '_ll help and make your customers much happier .
neutral	it shouldn_'_t be an ordeal to contact you and the way you ' re set_up at present it really is .
neutral	one more thing , if you ' re not going to take calls don_'_t list an 000 number that puts you on hold for ten_minutes then_hangs_up on you .
neutral	it '_s like getting flipped the bird , not helpful .
neutral	the lack of ability to call cost them two stars .
neutral	look at one line sentence , tells it all .
neutral	went all the way through booking three leg journey to france but then got an ' unusual error ' at the end after giving my payment details .
neutral	it was sorted within a few_minutes .
neutral	two other things .
neutral	the french leg part of the fare nearly doubled from one day to the next .
neutral	not sure why .
neutral	secondly last page of pdf tickets was garbled but printed ok second time through .
neutral	have bought many superb bargains from the outdoor_shop in the past and my recent_purchase was no exception .
neutral	however , the delivery by parcel_force has_been extremely disappointing .
neutral	after trying to deliver , the left an unintelligible note_saying my parcel is at a post_office which simply doesn_'_t exist .
neutral	so using the delivery code i arranged for re - delivery using their online tracking_system to the same address .
neutral	i received confirmation of the redelivery , but it hasn_'_t been redelivered .
neutral	again i went online to arrange redelivery , this was 0 days ago , and no they still_haven_'_t delivered !
neutral	exceptionally poor service , would have been better sent via_royal_mail and that '_s saying something !
neutral	i ordered 0 parts and was charged separate shipping_charges for each where one item was so small that it could have fit into the other shipping package and both came from the same place !
neutral	!
neutral	otherwise , i got the parts on time and as_described .
neutral	good but not great .
neutral	it often shows irrelevant and unverified information .
neutral	i can not answer because i '_m still_waiting for you guys tell me about the return of the parties
neutral	price not always competative but overall service pretty good .
neutral	just improve your comunication , confirmation , and updates to customers , im not sure if ill return , i felt very mistreated as a customer who is spending 000 bucks !
neutral	!
neutral	u guys can be better_than that cheers !!!!!
neutral	!
neutral	the part i recently ordered was delivered two working days_later than it should have been due to partsgeek sending the part by ups to the local post_office for delivery .
neutral	the ups truck comes by my residence between 0 : 00 and 0 : 00 am .
neutral	the package was delivered to the usps the day it should have been delivered to me .
neutral	the usps delivered the package to me late the next afternoon .
neutral	during_installation of the engine_mount part number am0000 .
neutral	discovered that the out board bolt hole did not align with the bracket mounted on the vehicle .. this delayed the installation and the vehicle was down another day ... purchased a drill bit and reamed the hole to proper size ... future customers need to be aware , that am 0000 engine_mount needs additional rework , this is not a oem part and it shows ...... good day
neutral	to charge over £ 0 to ship a button using a 00 p stamp is taking the mickey
neutral	i made this purchase because i was trying to find a quick gift i could send to a friend .
neutral	but i felt_like i was purchasing something shady and ultimately thought i was purchasing a gift_card made out specifically so that the recipient could purchase something from a particular store .
neutral	i came to find out that it was just like a money card which disappointed me .
neutral	i had a very pleasant and professional experience with autoeurope when booking my car -- stateside .
neutral	i can '_t say the same about my experience with europcar in italy -- either in milan ( where they stiffed me for about an eighth of a tank of gas , claiming the tank was full ), nor at the florence city office ( which was overwhelmed and unequipped to deal with rentals and returns ).
neutral	i purchased 0000 mavic_ksyrium equipe wheelset which were at a very competitive price , whilst delivery and communication were at the highest_level , the product came to me faulty as front_wheel was not running true .
neutral	the wheels were well_packaged so i do not think this was damaged in transit all though a possibility .
neutral	i then had to repackage wheels to send back , picked a delivery slot for the morning stayed in for the selected pick_up , only to receive phone_call that they would be picking wheels up in the evening !
neutral	one day wasted not merlin_cycles fault as this was probably just my bad luck .
neutral	previous purchases with merlin_cycles have been good so i think this is just a one off !
neutral	i have been waitng for a response to a request i put in on 0 / 00 / 00 the support_ticket number is 000000 .
neutral	if someone has a minute to answer my quesion it would be very helpful .
neutral	i was also wondering_if you have a 0 . 000 number i can call in the future to ask questions since i have not received a response to my email .
neutral	thank_you
neutral	product had damage on it but wasn_'_t going to go thru the hassle of having to shop it back .
neutral	well being a long time shopper with shopto overall i can say for hardware prices and delivery they are 0st_class .
neutral	anything_else where they use standard royal_mail is extremely hit and miss if you receive it .
neutral	general rule of thumb is that if you haven_'_t received your order after 0 days then you won_'_t receive it at all in my experience .
neutral	i find the customer service average and the delay in issuing a refund due to lost parcels and the whole_process is an exercise in frustration .
neutral	especially when retailers like amazon issue refunds immediately .
neutral	0 of my last 0 videogame orders haven_'_t turned_up so once i get the latest issue resolved i will no_longer be ordering games from them .
neutral	i thought i was ordering sheer support sox but when they were delivered they were thick spongy sox
neutral	this idea is wonderfull and the website is good .
neutral	however , i '_m waiting for the package for 00 days .
neutral	i order the july_0th and we are the 00th and i didn_'_t receive anything ( except an_email with a pdf ).
neutral	the customer service send me the tracking and i should receive it in 0 days .
neutral	what '_s on the cruise was supposed to get cruise credits did not receive all crews credits then you guys were going to mail me a check , haven_'_t seen anything still nothing , i '_m going to have to call again this will be the 0th time calling to get this resolved .
neutral	booked a hotel for lissabon that it was supposed to cost 0000 eur and when i was done booking i saw that my card was charged for 0000 eur instead !!
neutral	even in my confirmation says that the price for the hotel is 0000 eur .
neutral	when i mail them they said that they want a bank_statement that shows that 0000 was charged and when i send them they say that the 00 eur is a bank fee !!!!!!
neutral	or even worst , is the currency difference !
neutral	!
neutral	the worst thing is that they stopped answering my mail and there is no free phone_number ( which it says clearly on their home page ) to call them !
neutral	i hope they solve this problem !
neutral	edit # 0
neutral	after that i have called them they agreed to compensate me within 0 - 0 bank days !
neutral	they were supposed to confirm this agreement by mail 0 min after our conversation , still no mail !!!
neutral	!
neutral	to be continued ...
neutral	edit # 0
neutral	now i , ve been compensated for the trouble !
neutral	i might book my next trip using olotel . com and give them another chance to redeem themselevs !
neutral	great products .
neutral	but very slow delivery process .
neutral	delivery status must be more accurate .
neutral	if your products isnt in store , you must give feedback to customer .
neutral	0 - 0_weeks waiting is to long !
neutral	they where quick to pick_up the items , which i was impressed about , but where abit slow iin payment and could do with improving communication with customers ( eg emails on whearabouts etc ). i would use this service again though .
neutral	after being shipped and delivered , item came with nicks & cracks from being a brand_new item .
neutral	freezer arrived_promptly and the delivery team were great .
neutral	i '_ve had about 00 follow_up calls which i haven_'_t answered and there is no message left so i didn_'_t call back .
neutral	i trie dthe number the other day and it was ao .
neutral	if you want to speak to me leave a message so i know who is calling and i will ring back .
neutral	i purchased several clips on pond0 and was mildly satisfied , some of the clips that claimed to be in hd for $_00 were terrible quality once i downloaded them ..
neutral	not to mention that 0 clips that i purchased were the wrong clips entirely when i downloaded them , and when i brought it to pond0 '_s attention , they offered a weak excuse and 0 coupons for $_00 each , so basically a $_00 coupon to say sorry for a $_000 mistake .. which they say they ' re in the process of solving .. but they ' re not .
neutral	so by now i '_ve had to deliver my project cause the deadline was up , and it '_s missing those 0 crucial shots ..
neutral	what really pissed me off is that i went to look and those shots were still listed on the website up for purchase , even after the rep told me that they don_'_t even have those files ...????
neutral	?
neutral	waiting to see if your return_policy has some hidden agendas .
neutral	i ordered a part for my car but found out that my car has older engine components .
neutral	i have filed a customer report but haven_'_t heard_anything back from them so ... i '_ll see
neutral	your ad suckered me in with a posted sale price of $_00 . 00 .
neutral	when i got thru downloadinng , your price had become $_00 . xx !
neutral	is this " deceptive advertising " or " bait - and - switch "?
neutral	bob in tulsa , ok .
neutral	i '_ve done business with parts_geek a couple times in the past_year or so .
neutral	it was satisfying .
neutral	on this occassion , it really put me in a jam to wait an extra 0 days for a part i could have bought locally for about $_00 more and had a car to drive 0 - days earlier ( two jaguar tie_rods ends ordered , but were shipped from separate locations .
neutral	one did arrive in two_days , the other took 0 - days ( and arrived about 00_hours ago ).
neutral	the job is done , i have wheels again .
neutral	parts_geeks has a lot of great parts at fair pricing , but one , they short paid the shipping by $ 0 . 00 .
neutral	i e_-_mail them and have never gotten a response back - what '_s up with that .
neutral	that and the part i ordered was the wrong one my bad there , but the refund will take up to 00 days .
neutral	again - what '_s up with that ??
neutral	?
neutral	0_stars is being far too generous .
neutral	the website seemed to be very basic and did not allow for more detail on the hotel .
neutral	however , it allowed_me to make the reservation i needed .
neutral	inundated with emails till you don_'_t know which way is up or down .
neutral	got me for a $_00 .. core .
neutral	paid more than it would have costed me to buy local , and the unit failed year later .
neutral	this was the worst online shopping_experience i have ever had .
neutral	total partsgeek took me for 0 core charges $_000 .
neutral	restocking_fee $_00 . 00 they sent the wrong part my cost to return wrong part $_00 . 00 . and core_return $_00 . 00 my loss was $_000 . 00 and as a added_bonus a poor product .. support your local small business , it seems these_guys are out to get you !..
neutral	oh and i had problems with their tracking_numbers .
neutral	it is a good product and i think that to a normal person it would keep them sweat free for the day , but for me it seems that i could still feel it come through and if i was wearing a tight top that is a light colour then i dont think that it would stop the sweat marks for me .
neutral	i have quite large shoulders and big armpits so i do get hot very quickly and i seem to sweat throughout the day at the office and not in short periods , i think this product would be fine but my issue is a bit more potent than this top can solve so im_gonna try and combine some products and hope for the best !
neutral	boxes arrived poorly_packed and in bad condition .
neutral	caused me to open immediately and check for damage .
neutral	i had just replaced the tie_rods on the other side .... same moog part numbers from another_vendor .
neutral	that " kit " came with the boot and clamp set included ... this " kit " did not forcing me to find them locally before i can do the job .
neutral	not very happy about that .
neutral	it is a good job i wasn_'_t in a hurry for the replacement cartridges as they took a week to get here .
neutral	it may have been the postal service .
neutral	i bought a ring in oct 0000 .
neutral	i used a so - called " personal shopper " at brilliance to select my diamond and ring .
neutral	while i didn_'_t find the personal shopper very personable , my complaint is about the service ( or lack of service provided ).
neutral	i was told in writing by the personal shopper that my stone would be eye - clean .
neutral	it was not .
neutral	in fact there '_s a blatantly obvious black spot that is easily visible with the naked eye !
neutral	unfortunately i had no time to return the ring without completely botching my engagement plans .
neutral	to add_insult to injury , the ring shipped later than promised and had loose prongs !
neutral	if you are going to buy an_engagement_ring from brilliance , allow plenty of time for returns .
neutral	buyer_beware .
neutral	i received a call that service was to be performed as contracted .
neutral	i acknowledge receipt of the notification and asked in my replay approximately what time the service was to be performed because i wanted to inform my retired neighbor who keeps an eye on the house .
neutral	i never received an answer .
neutral	a receipt of the services performed was left behind .
neutral	i checked out the unit but i could not tell whether the service was performed or not .
neutral	everything looked dry and clean ; i couldn_'_t tell whether the filter was changed as it looked just like the one that had been on the engine .
neutral	if all was done according to the contract , the service staff is to be congratulated on a job well_done as everything was " clean as a whistle " just as it has_been all along .
neutral	so , it is not with criticism that i say i cannot tell whether service was done or not ; i simply could not tell one way or the other .... that is why i gave it a rating of 0_stars .. otherwise , i would have given the service five_stars , if i could tell that the service was performed .
neutral	i trust if was !
neutral	ordered a back - up light switch for my 0000_nissan_frontier .
neutral	the website assured me it was the correct part .
neutral	it didn_'_t fit .
neutral	just going to order one through the dealer .
neutral	online it stated that you could pick your contract start date and they would hold the unit for you .
neutral	i wanted to start 0 0 / 0_weeks from now , but as soonas i reserved it , they called and said it was first come first served ... and that if anyone came and wanted the unti they would give it to them unless i paid for the partial month rent .
neutral	good selection of books at reasonable prices , and very responsive customer_support .
neutral	however , books are mailed to us in flimsy , 0 ply plastic_wrapping , and books of different_sizes are put in these wrappers without anything to pad , stabilize or stiffen the inside of the package .
neutral	most of the books i have received from awesome have had some damage from mailing , usually bent corners , creased covers and / or bent spines .
neutral	once i even received an empty package with a note from the post_office saying that the package had been received empty .
neutral	the booking was easy and the guy that turned_up was very helpful .
neutral	if the service was cheaper i would be_happier .
neutral	order was easy to place and was followed_up on quickly .
neutral	company confirming order s a safety was very nice .
neutral	order arrived quickly and that ie where the fun stopped .
neutral	unpacking the order showed it was handled very poorly .
neutral	many cans are dented some almost in half .
neutral	it '_s a good service , once the automated booking had been transferred to the local repair company they contacted me promptly , offered to come a day earlier and the bulgarian engineer was punctual , polite , knowledgeable and very helpful .
neutral	he fixed the dishwasher without_any new parts and it worked for three more days before i had to call them back .
neutral	i ' d still use the company again .
neutral	often olotels has the cheapest price on comparison_sites - but the actual price they display for your purchase will vary according to the links you click to get to them .
neutral	through cashback sites like quidco , for example , olotels will automatically inflate the price of the room so you pay more and the cashback discount is effectively worthless .
neutral	also , always check with the hotel you ' re booking that they '_ve received the olotels reservation in their own system , saves disappointment .
neutral	i like the taste of the product .
neutral	the case is a little big for home use , but doable .
neutral	in the second case that i bought , many of the filter packs were split_open causing a mess , were unusable and thrown_away .
neutral	i mentioned this in the comments section of my next order .
neutral	no response , but ok : it was an order form after all .
neutral	when i received the friendly " thanks for your order " email , i replied and again stated the problem and my hope for a better experience this time ; again , no response .
neutral	so_far , this recent order has_been fine but you must be_careful as the filter packs are sometimes caught in the seal of the outer packaging and can easily be torn .
neutral	i would give five_stars except for issue with the checkout page .
neutral	payee name / billing_address fields are needed where you enter the credit_card number .
neutral	we used a different credit_card and the payment did not go thru because the name on the card did not match the billing name on file .
neutral	the card was frozen for " attempted fraud " as a result .
neutral	i have order from partsgreek . com before and my experience with them is when you made your order and you try and call them back you have a hard time getting a whole of some one . when you make a order and you make a mistake after you check out , you can '_t go
neutral	back and make_changes to that order . you should be able to make correction if you have too , without having to make out a ticket to let
neutral	you know . and some one should answer the phone without having to make out a ticket .
neutral	i made a mistake with my order and order more than i needed . i need to return some items what should i do , i have
neutral	the the rma nu .
neutral	for the returns ?
neutral	il a fallu parlementer pour réussir à avoir la catégorie choisie :
neutral	ref : r0000x0000
neutral	product : vw polo a /_c a ou équivalent .
neutral	le " a " était interprété comme un véhicule de catégorie " a " et non comme un véhicule " automatique ".
neutral	le " ou équivalent " s ' est traduit par la mise à disposition d ' une opel corsa , et , pour qui connait les boites s tronic de wv / audi , c ' est un autre monde , de_la préhistoire !
neutral	voilà , à part ça , tout s ' est_bien passé !
neutral	best regards .
neutral	i have been purchasing my annual_travel_insurance from multitrip for the last few_years .
neutral	this year they would not cover me for my health condition even_though my health has not deteriorated .
neutral	i ordered the fridge on a friday for next_day delivery and yes it arrived the next_day but at 0pm and not the arranged time .
neutral	there was no communication to say the delivery would be late and the automated service to track the delivery was confusing to say the least !
neutral	reliability is good so_far !
neutral	not sure about call quality though !
neutral	improvement needed by allowing users to vary bandwidth through online account !
neutral	alternatively , setting a higher default bandwidth to improve call quality !
neutral	the product is exactly_what i expected .
neutral	the posting was prompt .
neutral	although the product was expensive for a pair of young boys trainers .
neutral	couldn_'_t get hold of the them anywhere_else !
neutral	i was sent the wrong rotors , they had obviously been shipped out before and returned .
neutral	they sent me an_rma to return them , my problem is it cost me $_00 to return them .
neutral	got great products but slow to ship and very bad communication on back ordered products
neutral	the spoiled_rotten box was nice , but our dog ( bichon ) had stuffing everywhere with the toy , it only lasted about 00_minutes .
neutral	she only liked one box of the treats and there were no chews , which would have been nice .
neutral	the dog wipes came in handy with the snow and salt , especially with our hardwood floors .
neutral	we are going to give the spoiled_rotten monthy box one more month and hopefully it will be a little more useful .
neutral	thanks
neutral	i needed to contact priceline in order to add another name to my hotel reservation since i had been delayed by weather and the other person was at the hotel but couldn_'_t be admitted to the room .
neutral	i called priceline on my cell_phone to make the change and found that i needed to use a touch tone phone rather_than my cell_phone to navigate the menu .
neutral	i was at an airport_terminal_building and had to locate a touch tone phone in order to complete the call .
neutral	this makes no sense to me .
neutral	i was pressed for time and the use of my cell_phone would have made the transaction much_simpler and faster .
neutral	i was also talking to a non_- english_speaking person_who never did get things right .
neutral	i needed information faxed to circus circus at reno nevada and i think it went to las_vegas since it never reached the reno location .
neutral	great service , but wish there was a meet and greet at a specific place in the airport .
neutral	it can '_t be expected that you know your way around an airport and there is nothing you are given to show and / or tell you exactly how to find your car / the concierge .
neutral	if that was in place , or just some signs - it would be perfect ... except if you were parked under a tree and your car is covered in leaves and bird poo as mine was !
neutral	the hotel staff was very cordial and helpful with my transaction .
neutral	upon my return , i had to wait for about 00_minutes before being picked_up .
neutral	ojo porque se contrata una cantidad y luego se paga más .
neutral	aparecen cargos administrativos , te convencen para pagar un seguro , que_la compañía ya tiene pagado .
neutral	pagas el depósito lleno por adelantadao pero luego lo has de devolver lleno , si no tienes un recargo fijo .
neutral	cuando contratas no esta nada claro lo_que acabarás pagando
neutral	received my mirrors in a timely_manner my calls get dropped when i do call and have to call over and over again .
neutral	takes so long to speak to a customer service rep having to get charged so much for a restocking_fee is rediculous .
neutral	where is my
neutral	refund already ?!?!?
neutral	experience is frustrating
neutral	ordered the large 00cm clock with my own design , hoping to have something snazzy in the kitchen lol .
neutral	it took approx 00 - 00 days and needed signing , but unfortunately , wasn_'_t right when it arrived .
neutral	it was quite apparent too , with the outer design off - centre and obviously not what i wanted .
neutral	an_email discussion over the next 00hrs advised me to return it in the packing with the prepaid_label , so_far so good !
neutral	this time , it took less_than 00 days to return and sign again for .
neutral	the design was perfect and central this time .
neutral	however , the clock mechanism you fit to the glass clock wasn_'_t .. being of low quality plastic mould ( i could see the untrimmed flash on some of the hands ), and this caused problems .
neutral	the second_hand , when fitted , wouldn_'_t operate correctly and so was removed .
neutral	this now meant the hour and minute hand worked , but the clock was gaining approx 00_minutes a day because of the mechanism distribution .
neutral	a further email resulted_in almost_instant resolving the problem with a new set of hands being sent ..
neutral	i await those at present and wonder_if the hands will solve the problem or i '_ll be forced to buy a new clock mechanism of better quality .
neutral	overall though , jessops responded well and treated me as i ' d expect , so i cannot_fault their customer service .
neutral	i really wanted my design on a clock , on glass instead of other mdf offered products elsewhere , so jessops eventually delivered on what i wanted ..
neutral	its cheap , you shoud go there .
neutral	three_days_later than originally scheduled .
neutral	price turned_out to be average and not_necessarily best .
neutral	to be fair the staff did phone me each day to update .
neutral	enjoyed the whole_experience , great selection , fast service , had price match but sunglassses didnt fix right , sent back $ 0 . 00 cost to sent back , then 00_% restock_fee ,, after that amount .
neutral	the return amount to ship return then the $_00 . 00 restock , it was $_00 . 00 just to try on for a total of 0 mins ... great company but it cost me to try to purchase on line
neutral	i have purchased multiple_times from pureformulas items have always arrived fast and were exactly as ordered .
neutral	this time i had a problem with using a coupon .
neutral	i informed pf with my order ... they never responded and didn_'_t apply coupon .
neutral	i will give them a chance because of prior experience but this is not good business .
neutral	i ordered top secret nutrition '_s 000_% whey and received a free thing of astravar .
neutral	also there are alot of free_gifts that you can pick_up if you want to which is awesome .
neutral	the only problem is that the shipping was 00 dollars and only got more_expensive with the free items you choose .
neutral	if you need the item that is free then the slight increase in shipping is well_worth it though .
neutral	overall , i think if you find one of the deals ( like free astravar ) it is well_worth it .
neutral	but if the price of the product is only a little_bit cheaper_than another site and they have free shipping then it is probably a better bet .
neutral	i am going to keep my eye out for more of the deals and i can almost guaruntee i will be shopping here again
neutral	bad : you could not choose the color of the buttons , too few fabrics to choose from .. dhl does not ring before they come and if you are not home when they arrive , you have to go across town to pick_up your package .
neutral	i ordered the labels for a cd so that i could use them for a clients wedding images .
neutral	the cd labels came very quick but the image was beyond pixelated and pretty embarrassing to have to give to a paying client .
neutral	unfortunately time constraint required i had too .
neutral	i know i uploaded a high resolution image to the site to be printed so i am still a little questionable if i will come_back again based on the pixelation in the final copies i was provided .
neutral	i called regarding an alert i received and the representative that i spoke to took my information and put me on hold .
neutral	after holding for 00_minutes without him coming_back to let_me know the status , i decided to call again on another line .
neutral	the 0nd rep was able to assist me within minutes .
neutral	when the 0st rep came back after 00_minutes i kindly let him know that i had already been assisted and that his service was horrible .
neutral	while trying to book a ticket by phone , i waited through a lengthy phone tree .
neutral	eventually a real_human at a call station in nicaragua was able to help me , but her slow internet_connection took us 00min to get the ticket .
neutral	she was very nice and trying hard .
neutral	although the booking process was made easy , the tickets took three_weeks to arrive , even after explaining my printer was not
neutral	working .
neutral	although the flights were with emirates airline there is not enough time between flights
neutral	in dubai we had a long walk , two lifts , a long train journey and
neutral	two customs checks before catching our connections .
neutral	at 00 and seventy years old please think again flight centre
neutral	when arranging your itineries !
neutral	regards
neutral	brian and mary .
neutral	what a joke and a huge waste of time .
neutral	this transaction was a nightmare , my first and last from parts_geek .
neutral	i knew_exactly_what part i needed ( by industry bearing number , and oem original number ) but their worthless website / ordering system would not let_me enter the part number i needed , but by application .
neutral	the bearings they sent me didn_'_t even apply to the application i ordered it for .
neutral	then took a week for a response , no phone_number to call ( i finally found one through unconventional methods ).
neutral	save_yourself some hassle do not purchase anything from parts_geek , i recommend you go to a local parts store , and support your local_businesses , and you can talk to the counter person yourself , and ensure you have the correct part .
neutral	parts_geek ????
neutral	never again !!!!!!!
neutral	!
neutral	incredible service !!!!
neutral	valuation could be better though , otherwise could have been 0_star
neutral	better 0st time i used their services
neutral	only nine_days since my order and have not received the gift_card yet .
neutral	therefore , my experience is not good or bad .
neutral	my rating would change upon_receipt of the card and how long it takes to arrive .
neutral	when we were planning trip , we had great assistance in booking flights , hotels and rental vehicles , however when things went wrong with flights that got delayed or cancelled the assistance was very poor .
neutral	you can actually say none existence .
neutral	we were advised that it was not " their fault that the airport was closed " and that they could not assist us in getting our people help that was stranded because of the incident .
neutral	i made a purchase in may and thought i would have gained some maxirewards because of it , but when i log in there are none there .
neutral	what has changed ?
neutral	why on earth does this site send you the confirmation to print that is 00 pages in double sized letters .
neutral	please make it a simple 0 page print !!!!!
neutral	!
neutral	no_complaints on product and price but i think it is unfair to pretend a sale is ending when it is not .
neutral	the sale has_been ending ( complete with countdown clocks etc ) and been extended several_times - this causes customers to rush and panic buy when there was never any intention to end the sale , a bit crafty ...
neutral	in the past i have had exceptional service , this year i was not told about a change in ordering .
neutral	so consequently my order was late .
neutral	the product is great .
neutral	i wished i would have known about the change when i ordered .
neutral	other than that i very happy .
neutral	its generally very good and there are some real_bargains to be had .
neutral	there have been occaisions where £_00 items being sold for £_00 were dubious - on receiving , they would never have commanded £_00 and its obviously a mechanism to create interest in a low quality product .
neutral	wowcher themselves seem pretty good - just about to test a refund though !!
neutral	!
neutral	and they could vet products a bit more carefully .
neutral	partsgeek is a great website with more selection than even the " big part " names , the prices are very competitive , the order process was a breeze and the delivery time exceeded_expectations , all great attributes .
neutral	however , i was dismayed to find that two ( 0 ) of the three ( 0 ) parts ordered were incorrect and now i must initiate an_rma to get the right parts .
neutral	unfortunately i aleady paid a mechanic to replace the one ( 0 ) correct part and now must pay again to have the replacement parts installed ( which would have been free installs the first time through since theyy required removal and re - install for the correct part ), argh .
neutral	i do not like the return_policy
neutral	the website works really well and the discounts by group buying is a bonus .
neutral	generally this does work pretty well .
neutral	i '_ve ordered maybe 0 or 0 times .
neutral	i '_ve had a couple of occassions when the delivery has_been outside the time quoted .
neutral	once it took a full 00 working days for delivery .
neutral	you get the feeling that suppliers push boiler_juice orders to the very back of the queue .
neutral	the website makes you pay in advance on the website , so you are out of pocket while waiting delivery .
neutral	last_year i paid in advance , but unknown to me , they failed to actually take the money through their on - line payment system .
neutral	then suddenly , a full year later right on christmas , they sent me a letter threatening legal_action - pretty rude considering i ' d thought i ' d already paid in full and there had been no previous contact .
neutral	i swore i ' d never use them again after that experience but discovered they still offered the best price and i had about tenner in credit in my boilerjuice " tank account ".
neutral	so i went back and ordered again to my disgust .
neutral	i ' d still use them again and i think the overall concept is fantastic .
neutral	if all works well and you don_'_t need to talk to them then there should be no problem if you don_'_t mind a wait .
neutral	you might have problems if there is some issue though .
neutral	i purchased my typical size and they were way too small .
neutral	i paid to ship them back and bought a pair 0 " too large but they fit .
neutral	zappos and many others don_'_t charge for return shipping if the fit is wrong .
neutral	sales_person hovered the whole time and when i said i needed some time to think and then id be back , he yelled for his manager to come over to talk to me some more .
neutral	manager showed me a better product and quoted me a price then when he went to the register and looked it up , the price was $_00 more and he wouldnt give me the original price .
neutral	still bought the product since it was a good price for it , for what i needed .
neutral	just be ready to deal with annoying pushy salespeople
neutral	need more variety for men .
neutral	more pants
neutral	just placed my order really don_'_t know yet .
neutral	staff where very nice when contacted .
neutral	however delivery took alot longer_than advitised .
neutral	always like to use bookbyte but it often takes about 00 days to get the book delivered .
neutral	i usually don_'_t find out what books i need until about a week before class and i consistently receive my book in the mail about a week or two into class .
neutral	i ordered some rocksox sektor forks which were a good price and were delivered quickly - but when they arrived they were faulty .
neutral	i had to send them back ( which cost £_00 ) with a cover note explaining what was wrong and requesting the cost of return postage be paid or i would be happy for credit against future purchase .
neutral	i heard_nothing for a week and chased merlin up by e_-_mail .
neutral	i didnt get a response but the forks were delivered shortly_afterwards with no_explanation of what was wrong , no cover_letter and no refund of postage - which i think was poor service .
neutral	all the rotors and the rear_brake_pads worked_perfectly and the price was fantastic .
neutral	the front_brake_pads are nowhere close to the right part .
neutral	i double_checked that i ordered the right one , and i did but the pads did not fit .
neutral	i had to run to the store and pay full price for pads because i had everything off .
neutral	so i was only 00_% satisfied with my purchase .
neutral	it also took a while for the parts to ship .
neutral	ordered on thursday for guaranteed next_day delivery .
neutral	dpd tracker on friday showed tracker number as invalid .
neutral	phoned myprotein who confirmed problem with courier but that it would be delivered next_day even_though next_day was saturday .
neutral	it wasn_'_t .
neutral	it was delivered monday .
neutral	my experience with great resumes fast was not exceptional .
neutral	i was initially assigned to a resume writer in the midwest ( i am in ca ) who missed both of our scheduled appointments .
neutral	i complained / she bowed out , and i was reassigned to another writer in ca .
neutral	i felt the first draft i received after our phone interview was wordy and the stats i had provided were not accurately presented .
neutral	i responded with a fairly extensive edit , all of which was incorporated in the final draft .
neutral	i would say that the final product and cover_letter were ultimately acceptable , but time will tell what responses i receive .
neutral	finally , i would also say the process was not ' fast '.
neutral	because my assigned writer had to be replaced , the resume and cover_letter took a little over 0_weeks to complete from start to finish .
neutral	the price is right , but a full 0 days for delivery .
neutral	i '_m glad i didn_'_t need them in a hurry .
neutral	everything was great all parts came as scheduled
neutral	i bought a oakley frogskin , the order was done fine , the delivery within the days provided but the frame on the sunglasses had two scratches one of them being right in front of the frame and quite deep / noticeable .
neutral	im a bit disappointing with the product because i noticed the plastic box where the glasses came didn_'_t have any sealed plastic or sticker on it so i presume it has being opened before .
neutral	they are have in stock , but no hardware in box , grrrr
neutral	i '_m a 0nd time user with n0_wireless , their pricing brought me back .
neutral	i don_'_t remember any_issues with the 0st order , but the 0nd the item that i ordered was out of stock and i didn_'_t find out until i called them a week_later .
neutral	they said they sent an_email , but i never got it .
neutral	the thigh high socks do not stay up ... they are high_quality but the top elastic band does not hold the socks in place ... disappointed in these socks ... i guess i will have to go back to the knee high socks
neutral	order processed very speedily .
neutral	some prices cheaper_than other_suppliers but others more_expensive .
neutral	need to compare before shopping .
neutral	ordered lenses 0_weeks_ago and it still has not shipped .
neutral	i '_ve ordered 0 times from baracuta '_s online shop .
neutral	the good :
neutral	0 ) the clothes are terrific and i love them .
neutral	0 ) all problems were ultimately resolved
neutral	0 ) great discounts / shipping to the us
neutral	the bad :
neutral	0 ) i had 0 size mis_- shipments that needed to be returned
neutral	0 ) they lost / never processed one of my orders even_though i received an_email order confirmation
neutral	0 ) it was impossible to contact them either via_email or through their online contact form .
neutral	ultimately i resorted to faxing them .
neutral	0 ) communication was sparse and a bit nerve - wracking .
neutral	all that said , i will_continue to shop with them because the quality of product is so superior and the problems were ultimately resolved .
neutral	were they to improve their customer - service communication i ' d be thrilled .
neutral	the car is ok , service is acceptable .
neutral	dropping_off the car at t0 was easy & the guy was waiting to collect the car ; however after collecting our_luggage i placed the call as requested & no one answered .
neutral	i called again in the terminal & number was engaged , then tried a 0rd time & number just rang & rang .
neutral	finally got through when we arrived at the car_park & was told my car would be 00_minutes , which turned_out to be 00_minutes - not good for a stress_free pick - up standing in a freezing_cold car_park .
neutral	i could have parked for half the cost in a remote car_park & caught the bus in the same time !
neutral	!
neutral	0nd time i rented from auto_europe .
neutral	was dissatisfied last time , but lured back in with a very low rental rate .
neutral	this time rented a fiat_panda " or similar " and was given fiat_000 ... both very small car , but the 000 was impossible to fit 0 people and 0 bags .
neutral	paid_extra to upgrade to fiat_punto ... no big_deal .
neutral	the 000 is ridiculously small , though , and should not be considered in the same class as the panda .
neutral	got up into the alps and realized that the snow_chains provided in the trunk were not the right size for the car .
neutral	got hung_up in snow a few_times , and could not go the places we wanted out of fear of being in an accident .
neutral	when we returned the car , the attendant agreed the chains didn_'_t fit ... and otherwise didn_'_t really care .
neutral	this is the 0nd time i '_ve rented from auto_europe .
neutral	the last time ( earlier this year ), i ended_up paying an_enormous ticket for illegal parking when i returned the car in rome — the only problem is , the auto_europe agent waved me right into that spot and told me to leave the car there .
neutral	lesson_learned .
neutral	i will choose another rental company next time .
neutral	waited a full week for gaskets .
neutral	charged 0 separate shipping fees for one order .
neutral	you need a reasonably_priced alternative to ground_shipping , and my order has to come from 0 different places , that should not be my problem or expense .
neutral	website is easier to use compared with their competitors and the staff were really helpful on the phone .
neutral	postage charges are too high though , if you ever have to reutrn an item due to sizing problems you will wasily pay an extra £ 0 on top of the original purchase price .
neutral	i have bought a reasonable number of magnets from the company .
neutral	also mentioned to them of how i was trying to keep the costs down in order to make the project commercially viable .
neutral	they said about buying in quantity but their prices were still much
neutral	higher_than a rival company .
neutral	i believe they think i have a good product and therefore consider they should earn more as well .
neutral	wrong choice !
neutral	e ' andato tutto_bene con_il_mio acquisto , c ' è_stato solo un ritardo nella_consegna che è_stato poi comunque giustificato .
neutral	al prossimo acquisto sono sicuro che_non si ripeterà più !
neutral	i fiori erano bellissimi , tuttavia rispetto alla foto dimostrativa la composizione dei fiori era spoglia io invece credevo che comunque si rispettasse di_più l ' immagine dimostrativa .
neutral	va beh , spero comunque che la prossima volta fili tutto liscio .
neutral	lascio comunque 0 stelle !
neutral	this website is just ok .
neutral	it doesnt always give you the best prices availabe , but its not the worst either .
neutral	good products & price however ordering was a little pain .
neutral	i like the site because it gives the joe blow access to parts at a reasonable price , so thanks for your enormous amount of parts i have always found what i need .
neutral	it was real quick and i will use them agin in the further .
neutral	thank_you for some good prices
neutral	on board commentary poor - more interested in telling the driver if someone was getting off - so much of interest could have been said .
neutral	bus stuck in traffic for far too_long spoiling enjoyment .
neutral	many of the sights were just a flash rather_than a good view - some you got very near but never quite saw them .
neutral	without prejudice .
neutral	ordered 0 items for a toyota_tacoma pickup , a radiator support , grill assembly , headlight_assembly , and a side_marker_light .
neutral	although each item was wrapped in a thin wrapper or box , it was all thrown_into one very large oversized_box for the items .
neutral	everything could of fit into a box a quarter the size or smaller and even the delivery driver made that comment .
neutral	no packing_material between the items which is why the i can '_t honestly blame the carrier for the the damage to the plastic grill that was sustained .
neutral	all items combined weighed maybe 00 pounds at the most and i was charged for 00 pounds .
neutral	didn_'_t really understand that but dealt_with it as two of the items probably considered oversized but nowhere overweight .
neutral	haven_'_t had the chance yet to put the items on the truck but so_far other than the grill being broken and cracked in 0 different everything else looks to be in good shape and what i ordered .
neutral	happy with the easy of ordering and everything that i needed being in stock .
neutral	will probably order again , just one piece at a time .
neutral	both the transfers from and to the airport took at_least twice the time estimated time of 00_minutes .
neutral	very few of other passengers on the buses had journey times of 00_mins and i suspect those_who did had been quoted much shorter times to and from resorts nearer to the airport .
neutral	the departure from the airport was on time , probably because the bus was full when we arrived .
neutral	pick_up from the hotel was 00_minutes late
neutral	more realistic transfer times should be given , if they were on the pessimistic side i am sure passengers would not be too annoyed if they arrived at their destination .
neutral	early .
neutral	the system is a good one but unfortunately the human interface bit appears stretched due to lack of resource probably struggling to cope .
neutral	i had many missing reports and even received the wrong epc for the property .
neutral	they try hard but i get the impression the system has_been launched and has many teething_problems .
neutral	i did get approx 00 responses and the property was let within 0_weeks .
neutral	this was the first time that we have had to get a prescription from the vet . in order to buy dog_food .
neutral	the vet .
neutral	told us that a prescription was necessary to purchase this kind of food .
neutral	while shopping on the net i discovered that some of the food suppliers required a written prescription for the same food while some did not , including petflow .
neutral	is this some kind of a medical violation or what ?
neutral	it was much_simpler not to have to use a prescription but your add .
neutral	on the net should say that a prescription was not needed .
neutral	thanks much
neutral	when icould not find my correct password to sign in to bookit , i got a temporary password .
neutral	problem is ... it didn_'_t work ... i tried several_times
neutral	almost everything arrived , however there was one disappointment .
neutral	i had tagged i wanted no alternatives .
neutral	so what happened i received an_alternative , and a totally_unacceptable one at that .
neutral	i had ordered the andrex toilet rolls with puppies imprinted , just to have something different , what did i receive was a pack of plain_white toilet rolls , i could have purchased anywhere here in the us at a lot less cost .
neutral	the reason i wanted them , we can only get plain_white here in the us , so wanted a little different , if they had sent me , blue , green , peach , pink anything but white i would not have minded .
neutral	besides that everything else arrived ok and in good shape .
neutral	i was very satisfied with the part ordered .
neutral	the email received indicated that the part was shipped with fedex , the tracking_number which could not be found on fedex .
neutral	an_email was sent back to partsgeeks and was informed the fedex tracking_number was valid and shipping was just running behind orders .
neutral	checking with fedex the tracking_number could not be found .
neutral	the part was sent using us mail ( usps ) not fedex
neutral	i placed my order and gave my home zipcode instead of my po_box zip / i called customer service 00_minutes later and was told the error would be corrected , it was not 00 days after it was shipped i believe my knife is back where it started ...
neutral	your fees are too high .
neutral	the products ordered have still not arrived .
neutral	i used to get all my clothes from bananarepublic . com .
neutral	i liked banana republic before it was cool to like banana republic .
neutral	but now it '_s all mainstream and janky .
neutral	i hate that because now i can '_t shop there anymore .
neutral	i used to get all my plaid there , and my patterened tweeds and all my wool button down sweaters too .
neutral	and cool fedoras , knit toboggans , and scarves with strange prints .
neutral	now it '_s nothing but a hipster hangout .
neutral	i can '_t stand hipsters .
neutral	i recently needed to replace a defunct breaker type in an old breaker box .
neutral	home_depot carried the part in stock .
neutral	unfortunately , i had to rma * twice * because both_times the part arrived damaged and unusable .
neutral	cheers for having a hard to find part .
neutral	boos for shipping damaged inventory .
neutral	in the end , however , i did get my breaker .
neutral	i installed it and it works well .
neutral	in the future i will use their brick and mortar_stores only , to ensure i get a working , undamaged part before i leave the store .
neutral	pictures and products were as hoped they would be but service was ruined by firstly high cost of post followed by royal_mail who took an age to deliver , then managed to wait for a time when no one was home so i had to collect said items from their depot .
neutral	it is possible to have groceries delivered to your door , to an hours time_slot for half the price of royal_mail not to deliver a photo .
neutral	had the part i needed .
neutral	very inexpensive .
neutral	but two_weeks to ship it to me ?
neutral	really ?
neutral	especially paying $ 0 for shipping , i should have had it in 0 - 0 days tops .
neutral	i am still_waiting for my part .
neutral	slow slow slow !
neutral	the lap_top arrived in two_days , the only_thing was the bad marks o th top , and the time wasted was on the up grades that had to be done , i buy a number of things over the years from 0 . 000rpm i think that the price charged for the lap_top in this condition plus the time spent having to do all the up grades , this should have been done as you have refurbed the unit ?. i have found 0 . 000rpm ok in the past now ?
neutral	thanks bill .
neutral	i have been able to find parts here that i couldn_'_t find from other_suppliers .
neutral	i was disappointed on my last order though .
neutral	i ordered 0 small parts and paid the extra money for overnight delivery .
neutral	they shipped two of the parts overnight and the other 0 parts they shipped " ground " and i didn_'_t get them for 00 days !
neutral	when i complained they said i did not check the box on all of the parts indicating that i wanted them shipped overnight !
neutral	i told them that was an unsatisfactory response and they did nothing to correct the situation .
neutral	the price are a little to high and delivery is to slow to get to you .
neutral	0 item was not delivered in the order , please recheck the order of it '_s delivery .
neutral	sssssssssssssssssssssssss
neutral	i long for the days when skype had a simple user_interface .
neutral	now it '_s trying to be another facebook .
neutral	it '_s a phone book dammit !
neutral	the lead time from me sending the phone to you sending the chq was disappointing .
neutral	where do i start ?
neutral	i ordered all the parts to do a complete brake job on my mercedes_c000 , two_sets of rotors and pads .
neutral	everything seemed to go smoothly till i got an_email_saying i was getting a refund .
neutral	apparently they could not ship me the two front_rotors and were issuing a refund .
neutral	that wasn_'_t going to help me get the job_done so i called them .
neutral	for whatever_reason , they did not have the zimmerman rotors in stock even_though the website said they were available .
neutral	so we ended_up on a set of brembo rotors instead .
neutral	the rotors were a couple of dollars more which was ok , but i told them i wasn_'_t paying anymore shipping_charges to which he agreed .
neutral	all the parts came in quickly enough and i was happy with that .
neutral	did the job the other day .
neutral	i replaced the driver_side front rotor and noticed the original had holes in it for ventilation , the replacement did not .
neutral	ok i guess , probably not that critical .
neutral	when i went to do the passenger_side front , i pulled the replacement out and it did have holes in it , just like the original .
neutral	i looked at both boxes and the numbers on each were identical , with the exception that one had " ec " behind one number , which i suppose is for extra or extended cooling ?
neutral	i haven_'_t done anything about the mismatched fronts at this point .
neutral	i don_'_t feel_like having to go through the hassle of trying to swap out the first rotor and worst trying to send it back or swap it for a refund .
neutral	my overall opinion of this company is that they aren_'_t quite detail oriented or provide the best service for the dollar .
neutral	guys , i '_m still_waiting for my keyless entry fob .
neutral	i received the headlight_switch knob promptly , but have no_idea what '_s keeping the other part .
neutral	other than the wait i '_m satisfied that they had the parts i wanted .
neutral	i ordered product and paid - then they called a week_later and didn ; t even have it .
neutral	they were nice and i chose something different and they shipped right_away .
neutral	i do think though that they should be better about what '_s actually in stock and what '_s not .
neutral	the customer service representative lori said they shipped and i called usps and they said it wasn_'_t shipped .
neutral	the shipping time was to long .
neutral	i might bring my business back here but they need better customer service and shipping times
neutral	i received my product in a timely_fashion .
neutral	the package for the shipment was unacceptable .
neutral	a large_cardboard_box sealed with one piece of packing tape on the top and one on the bottom .
neutral	no inner stuffing to keep the item from moving around .
neutral	the item was a car mirror and was loose and moving all the place .
neutral	when the package arrived via_ups it was half open , tape coming off .
neutral	i am surprised i received my package with the item still inside .
neutral	just awful !
neutral	en fait le produit n ' etait pas disponible , contrariement a ce_qui etait indique sur_le site .
neutral	il ete en reapprovisionaiment .
neutral	donc il a ete ' expedie 0 jours apres l ' ordre .
neutral	la_livraison ( pas gratuite ) etait tres_rapide par_contre - sous le 0 jours ouvre '.
neutral	i am disappointed with only one part of your service .
neutral	as a 000_% disabled veteran i always get a discounted booking from hampton inns and there is apparently no place to request such discount on your website .
neutral	not only that , but my card was charged for both the booking and a $_00 . 00 incidental charge .
neutral	when i checked out another card was charged for the room at a different rate and i have yet to receive an adjustment back for the erroneous charge or the incidental charge of which i had no charges .
neutral	i have called the manager of the hotel and he promises a return call to resolve on monday !
neutral	not sure who caused the problem , but not happy about it .
neutral	the speed of turnaround is great .
neutral	the first transcript was excellent but the most_recent one is full of mistakes .
neutral	the designated speaker is wrong and this is from a video so you can see who is speaking .
neutral	many of the word are really wrong and i '_ve had to go back and watche the video and correct the whole thing .
neutral	my business orders from e_- bottles because we have found they have the best quality for a reasonable price .
neutral	i have probably placed ten orders from them .
neutral	recently service has gotten much slower .
neutral	i have an order that was placed a month_ago that has yet to ship .
neutral	everytime i call i am assured it has_been sent to the warehouse .
neutral	i wait a few_days_later ... no updates .
neutral	the only reason i am not upset is because i have not been charged because they do not bill until shipment .
neutral	i placed a $ 0000 order a week_ago ( different size ) and received it no problem so i have no_idea why the other cannot as well .
neutral	had to tell the guy to stop selling me i am buying it even_though the website said 00 . 00 yet he is telling_me 00 . 00 per_month .
neutral	told_him so i don_'_t save any money doing it through you and you are not the company i could call directly ... okay just do it so i can get this over with .
neutral	he was a nice man , just doesn_'_t know when to be quiet and actually listen .
neutral	would i recommend ?
neutral	why if i don_'_t save any money using it ?
neutral	you tell me .
neutral	the stainless_steel trim_piece is a little lighter and easier to bend than the original , which might explain_why the part had a slight bend on one end and a " wavy " surface in the middle .
neutral	i went_ahead and mounted the part anyway because i figured that the quality of the replacement wasn_'_t going to markedly improve with another attempt .
neutral	overall the ordering went great and i was just happy to get a replacement part that looks ok . after all , it '_s not a show car .
neutral	i '_ve gotta_say , if you ' re looking for rare game products or even old gems from the ps0 era play - asia is the site you wanna visit .
neutral	if it '_s an international order it '_ll be slow like a month approx .
neutral	but otherwise reliable .
neutral	your package will come to you !
neutral	good customer_support but unfortunately need it too often .
neutral	i only use your service because of frequent coupons ... grub hub is more functional and includes all the restaurants in dc
neutral	the medals where as hoped for but the centre " red cross " had fallen off 0 of the medals !
neutral	a little glue put them right !
neutral	i had booked mobile_tyre_fitting service for my merc .
neutral	the technician arrived on the day and time and completed his job well .
neutral	however , inspite of me explaining the max tyre pressure , the tyre was over pressured and next_day i came to know only when the warning sign came up .
neutral	i had to immediately rush to a service station on the motorway to get the pressure right .
neutral	this could have been avoided if the technician had been more attentive while fitting the tyres .
neutral	first of all , mahalo for having the part i needed .
neutral	my only_gripe .... and this isn_'_t directly solely to this company in particular but to all of the mainland company '_s i tried before going with you ...
neutral	why do you not ship to hawaii ???
neutral	?
neutral	i understand that you probably have negotiated shipping rates with certain providers , but it truly sucks that so many people do not ship to the 00th state .
neutral	usps_priority_mail flat_rate service would probably garner a lot of business out here for you folks .
neutral	which is why i had this shipped to a friend in cali , so she can send it to me from there for $_00 . 00 .
neutral	jus ' sayin '.
neutral	aloha ~
neutral	reasonable price to belarus and calls were okay for a while but calls became full of static and other parties could not always hear us .
neutral	we wanted a full_refund of $_00 balance due to continuing poor quality of service .
neutral	e_- mailed them at the proper address .
neutral	no answer .
neutral	e_- mailed again weeks_later - no answer .
neutral	could find no phone_number whatsoever at which to call them .
neutral	expect much_better of swedish company .
neutral	cnl
neutral	have revised up from two to three stars due to company efforts to rectify ( their reply here ) and my having found their place on - line where one can cancel service .
neutral	still , reply to emails is expectable .
neutral	cnl
neutral	it was easy to book the reservation , but we weren_'_t certain where to park at first .
neutral	the hotel clerk gave_us grief because we didn_'_t have a paper record of the reservation .
neutral	i showed him the confirmation_email and told_him the whole point of booking online was to be paperless and that in today '_s age , more and more people are abandoning the hassle of keeping printers at home .
neutral	while belittling us and lecturing about how the hotel doesn_'_t get reimbursed without a paper form , he claimed to be such a nice guy for letting us park there and that other clerks would make us pay twice .
neutral	( what a bunch of jerks that hotel must hire .)
neutral	i was worried when the ticket he gave_me wouldn_'_t let us out at the unattended gate after our trip , but after four or five tries , the machine finally accepted it .
neutral	i ordered 0 identical ankle supports , which by the way are great for my needs , unfortunately only 0 arrived in a massive box .
neutral	after a phone_call to a very efficient young_lady the second one arrived 0 days_later , again in a massive box which looked like it had been run over .
neutral	the alamo counter at lax was difficult to understand and they did not provide many options .
neutral	it felt more like a pressure_sales job .
neutral	i doubt if i would use alamo again .
neutral	i absolutely love the idea of putting custom pictures on visa_gift_cards with a custom card and message .
neutral	i can think of so many_times that could make a fantastic gift .
neutral	but it was very time_consuming to build the whole thing and checkout , and then if the they don_'_t like something about your project they kill the whole thing and you have to start over .
neutral	after the 0th time , i was getting a little frustrated .
neutral	but i was finally able to complete my order .
neutral	after a week i called to see if my order had shipped , it had , but no email to let_me know that .
neutral	they really need to let you save your projects on the site , so if there is one small problem you can just do a quick edit .
neutral	i particularly chose that bouguet of flowers over others because it said underneath that it was available for delivery that afternoon .
neutral	it was not delivered until the next afternoon .
neutral	however , bouquet was ok
neutral	best prices on the net for supplements !
neutral	the only kicker is that the shipping tends to be pretty high ...... overall though not bad .
neutral	originally purchased one for a new evouqe and so impressed with the great fit and ease !
neutral	then purchased one for a vogue and no where near the same excellent fit !
neutral	lots of diy sticky velcro ( just one way ) so dissimilar to the evoque !
neutral	flapping around on the back will look for an_alternative a disappointment compared to the first and no reason either !
neutral	why drop your standards ?
neutral	the reservation was not complete ... i reserved a non_- smoking_room , but the reservation was not transmitted to the motel correctly .
neutral	i thought i ' d try these as i '_ve always used genuine nespresso before and have read good reviews .
neutral	these are a bit cheaper_than the originals and it shows .
neutral	i think you really do get what you pay for .
neutral	the big cup little cup coffee is perfectly drinkable ( i '_m getting through them all ), but i just prefer the compact packaging , the bigger range of strengths and flavours and the better crema of the genuine nespresso_capsules .
neutral	the fast shipping is the best thing .
neutral	my pugs got very sick from the treats that i ordered .
neutral	petflow didn_'_t really do anything to look into the issue .
neutral	good price on part but , it was missing a piece when it arrived .
neutral	contacted partsgeek but they said they couldn_'_t send me just that piece so i had to pay more money and buy one at autozone .
neutral	partsgeek was not helpfull at all .
neutral	check the prices and add 00_%
neutral	i would definitely recommend this website to unlock the iphone , but the time needed to unlock it is way off .
neutral	it took them almost like a week for them to do it while they said only 0 day at max to unlock .
neutral	the coincidence is that they unlocked the iphone right after i opened the dispute with paypal .
neutral	though there are tons of restaurants in bay ridge there is not a great amount of choice for delivery .
neutral	com
neutral	false_advertising and misleading .
neutral	can '_t take_advantage of free chinese paper lantern offer if you are purchasing them , too !
neutral	no_explanation of this limit on website !!!
neutral	:(
neutral	good response once i had made contact with the right person , who new his trade well .
neutral	the prices are good but then when you go to book they add on a fee of £ 0 . 00 which is weather you pay by credit or debit so why not just include it in the initial quote !!!
neutral	!
neutral	happy with the service , price , etc , however the toner which we purchased had leaked in transit , so toner escaped onto barrel / drum , and made quite a mess in installing it .
neutral	not the company '_s fault , i guess that '_s the nature of refurbished toners sent through the post .
neutral	had it not leaked , i ' d have happily given a 0_star .
neutral	we had a good service from bathempire although we ended_up having to return some items which were sent to us even_though we had cancelled them before despatch .
neutral	we also had a problem with the courier jay transport in highbridge , somerset who refused to release the items form their depot even after telling us to go there are pick them up .
neutral	the no_quibble guarantee promised when ordering is a bit of a joke .
neutral	i received a faulty cartridge , which i returned to get an acknowledgement was no mean feat .
neutral	hopefully i have received a promised refund after all the efforts .
neutral	i placed my order on sunday_night and i just got the email that the ordered shipped late thursday_night .
neutral	four days to ship the product out , they have been faster on this .
neutral	next time i will use amazon , found out they had it for the same price plus i get two day free shipping with my prime account .
neutral	i am always happy how much you can save on supplements on this site , but it took 0_weeks to even ship out my $_000 order , and i didn_'_t receive it for another 0_weeks .
neutral	it is vitally important to ship out apo orders as soon as possible , because after it ships it takes at_least 0 to 0_weeks more than domestic orders to get to its destination .
neutral	plus , spending that much should qualify for free shipping as well .
neutral	pricing per text is higher_than most , but then if you want a useful control_panel then this is acceptable .
neutral	i have bought lots from merlin including 0 sensa bikes .
neutral	the bikes themselves are great , but the second took almost two_weeks to deliver despite_being bought from stock .
neutral	i assume this is a one off as all other orders from merlin_cycles have been prompt .
neutral	by_far the best vinyl prices on the internet .
neutral	however , desperately need to fix your inventory system .
neutral	probably ordered from you 00 timed , with only 0 / 0 of the shipments being completely filled .
neutral	frustrating for a collector , asi pass opportunities to order from your site only to be disappointed when item never arrived .
neutral	i found a scratchy not in my letter_box with wrong date - over a 00 days old - and said i had to sign for my delivery .
neutral	i rang up the delivery company and said i could leave the note , sign it and it will be left .
neutral	i live in a busy area so was not keen to have box left at front_door - i had to drive to depot to pick_up and sign .
neutral	it would have been easier for box to be sent at local post_office - i would have saved 00_minutes !
neutral	not sure what i '_ll do next time ??
neutral	?
neutral	purchase and delivery was absolutely great .
neutral	however if you try to contact the vendor , ao . com don_'_t expect to get them to pick_up .
neutral	i kept getting diverted to the hoover / candy service line who happpened to be so very busy it took 0 days to get a response .
neutral	still_waiting for a response from them .
neutral	tried to contact ao . com but the message wiped out twice .
neutral	if i had gone to a shop i could at_least have sat face to face with customer_services with my rant .
neutral	hello ao . com contact me please to understand the 0 major faults with my purchase .
neutral	disgruntled of saltash , cornwall
neutral	fairly simple to compare / book .
neutral	when we get there at the crack of dawn on sunday the single purpleparking rep was very stressed and the queue was building - could '_ve been slicker there .
neutral	we weren_'_t in a hurry but if we had been it wouldve been a pain .
neutral	when we called the number on our receipt to advise we were nr the airport there was confusion from the person_who answered the phone we suggested we ' d called the wrong number - we triple checked , we hadnt .
neutral	maybe i '_m being harsh here but i didn_'_t have my reference_number to hand when i called to say we ' d landed and it took a bit more time than it should for the responder to accept my registration_number as identification .
neutral	yeah this is probably me just being grumpy as it was late and i wanted to get home !
neutral	first pair arrived 0 days after the order placed .
neutral	pleasing .
neutral	second_pair i had to wait a further 0_weeks for them to arrive .
neutral	not so pleasing .
neutral	i had ordered some decaffeinated green_tea extract , 000mg .
neutral	the bottle on the web_site showed 000mg when enlarging the label .
neutral	so i ordered it , and when i received it , it was 000mg .
neutral	so i returned and as of today , 0 / 0 / 00 i have not received the credit back to my charge card .
neutral	so again , i just thought it was a mistake and ordered it again .
neutral	and again i received it and it was 000mg and not 000mg .
neutral	so this time i called in and the lady i spoke with came back and said they do not have this brand in 000mg anymore .
neutral	i told her she then needs to make the correction on the web_site .
neutral	she said she would have to have that done .
neutral	she said she would post an immediate credit to the credit_card and return a postage paid label to me .
neutral	have not received this year either .
neutral	so then i asked her what brand could i get this in 000mg .
neutral	she told me jarrow .
neutral	so i went on your web_site again to order this and it said it was out of stock .
neutral	so , i ordered a different brand in 000_mg , and will take this twice a day .
neutral	my dr . wanted me to take 000mg 0 times a day .
neutral	hopefully you will get back the 000mg supply which i had ordered from you for the last 0 years .
neutral	thanks .
neutral	i was very happy to receive my rab summit jacket from the outdoor_shop , but when it arrived it looked grubby / dirty .
neutral	i phoned the shop immediately to inform them and they said that it may be the down feathers showing through the jacket .
neutral	fair enough , but a little strange that no one noticed before sending it out .
neutral	anyway , arranged to return the item in exchange for a replacement ( different_colour ) and was told that this would be a ' goodwill_gesture ' and that i would not get a refund on my postage .
neutral	as the jacket was worth £_000 i had to send it special delivery at a cost of £_00 !
neutral	the new jacket has arrived and i am pleased with it , although i have a bit of a sour_taste in my mouth that they sent me a substandard item to start with then i had to fork out to send it back and get it changed .
neutral	ordered a verizon ipad and received an at & t ipad .
neutral	when i called i was informed that they were out of the verizon version and had upgraded me , at no cost to me as a courtesy , to the at & t version which is normally more_expensive .
neutral	i called and after explaining that i just needed to get an at & t plan for the ipad the representative agreed to issue and rma but i would have to pay to ship the ipad back to them .
neutral	when i pushed the issue that i didn_'_t order the wrong item and they substituted something without asking me first the csr said they couldn_'_t issue a return_label but he could send me a screen_protector .
neutral	we finally arrived at the company sending me a mailing_label .
neutral	they ultimately resolved the issue ( actually waiting on them to send me the replacement / more_expensive ipad ) but it shouldn_'_t have taken as much time or effort to get it resolved .
neutral	however , at the end of the day all of the reps were friendly and did seem to care about customer service so i will_definitely shop from them again .
neutral	i placed a large order for dog_food and treats ... free shipping = yay !
neutral	next i got 0 tracking #'_s and when i clicked through found out that 0 / 0 my order was " great " - it came fed_ex from a nearby state and arrived in 0 days from ordering .
neutral	the other 0 / 0 " sucks " - it was sent usps from clear across the country and after 0 . 0_weeks i am still_waiting ( says s / b delivered by tomorrow ).
neutral	how does that make_sense ?
neutral	send the father one faster ( fed_ex ) and the closer one by slow usps maybe ... but even that is kinda dumb .
neutral	i like the site , prices and service folks so i '_ll try petflow again but one more episode like this and it will be my last
neutral	good product but delivery was a little_slow as it was despatched from hong_kong .
neutral	0 .
neutral	pickup was one day late .
neutral	0 .
neutral	shipment was handled by a freight company not listed on the bol .
neutral	0 .
neutral	shipment went to a different terminal from the one on the bol .
neutral	this terminal was over 0 hours from my location .
neutral	freightpros resolved this , but it took over a week .
neutral	0 .
neutral	what was supposed to be a 0 - day transfer ( fl to va ) took over 0_weeks .
neutral	freightpros was reasonably responsive in resolving the problem , but i think in the future , i '_ll just pick a single trucking_company , rather_than go through a broker .
neutral	i know i haven_'_t shopped here in a while , but i guess i '_ll just take them out completely and unsubscribe to email .
neutral	my order had everything price reduced to beat out some other_websites and so i placed it .
neutral	received confirmation_email with lowered total and then see the next_day a higher total is taken out from them .
neutral	no email or heads up , so canceled my order .
neutral	from the total i think i '_ll just stick with my previous_supplier from the last time i reviewed who also has a flat_rate shipping of $ 0 . 00 .
neutral	i ordered a smoker , bee brush and a semi ventilated jacket on 0 / 0 .
neutral	the brush and smoker arrived quickly .
neutral	the jacket is somewhere hasn_'_t made it here .
neutral	i called and the nice lady said it would be arriving and shipped out last_week .
neutral	oops .
neutral	i '_m still_waiting .
neutral	my exhaust came by wednesday , the programmer came a 0 days_later and the inake is supposed to be here on wednesday .
neutral	i was really hoping that i would recieve everything by friday like i was told .
neutral	still_haven_'_t received my parts ordered about a week_ago
neutral	trying to reorder labels is difficult and cumbersome on their website , its strange you can '_t access previous_orders from the account_holder page , instead you have to find a previous order number and do a search , thats really ridiculous .
neutral	the prices are a tad expensive , the shipping_costs are reasonable .
neutral	i will search for an_alternative label source .
neutral	i would use them again but only if i cannot find a better solution , for now , it is my expensive , cumbersome , clumsy website that i tolerate but do not recommend .
neutral	the labels are attractive and very good quality .
neutral	i do like the labels .
neutral	all products finally arrived after a week - long wait .
neutral	i am surprised that all was well with my order after seeing the condition of the box it came in .
neutral	the box looked like it was used for football practice .
neutral	everything is fine though and i loved that shipping was free .
neutral	i have two complaints .
neutral	one with the service and the other with the car itself .
neutral	we were given the lancia ypsilon .
neutral	i asked to switch to a fiat_000 but was told that none were available , though there were some present in the parking garage .
neutral	we were told that it was an upgrade , but the lancia ypsilon and the fiat_000 are the same car class ( sub compact ).
neutral	the ypsilon had poor visibility in both rear and side windows making it difficult to park and back up in urban areas .
neutral	it also lack the horsepower needed for the hilly terrain in tuscany .
neutral	the gentleman that we dropped our car off with at the end of our trip was very friendly and provided us with good service .
neutral	i liked the parts but shipping was to much
neutral	i ordered some trainers and a cap , paid for speedy_delivery as really wanted the trainers for my holiday .
neutral	received my invoice , awaited delivery .
neutral	then received another invoice , i presumed it was just a vat_receipt .
neutral	delivery arrived_promptly but was just the cap .
neutral	looked at my invoices and noticed i had been credited with the trainers money back .
neutral	ideally a seperate emai telling_me why the trainers money had been returned would have been great as the cap was just an added extra and so i paid for speedy_delivery on something that i didnt necessarily need quickly .
neutral	used extremepie alot over the years and will use once more but if any probs then will probably avoid .
neutral	j_ai commende une mercedes et au_bout du compte je me retrouve avec_un golf parceke je_suis en retard
neutral	kel es cette histoire vu ke mon argent es deja debite il devrai me garder ma voiture 0 jour s il le faut vu ke je paye pr ca et il m on oblige a souscrire une assurance de 000_euros tt ceci se passe a l aeroport malpensa en italie chez locauto
neutral	vivant au etats unis ou le system es different jj etais choque mais n avais pas le_choix vu ke j y etais pr me marie
neutral	i understood from the on - line form that documents don_'_t need an invoice .
neutral	apparently , if you send a big box of them , they do .
neutral	driver and phone operators helpful , and problem sorted after a delay .
neutral	i submitted a request to customer service and have not received an_email containing my rma_number .
neutral	i will try the 0 - 000 - 000 - 0000 again .
neutral	aanvulling op_de one_sentence , als flyerzone zelf in gebreke blijft om_de rekening te sturen ben je als klant de pineut ( netjes uitgedrukt ) want dan kan je niet bestellen op rekening .
neutral	het duurde meer_dan een week voordat ze dat verholpen hadden .
neutral	als bedrijf kun je zien of een klant normaal altijd zijn rekeningen op_tijd betaald en kun je daar op in spelen en de klant voorzien van_een markering dat deze altijd kan bestellen of tot een limiet van_een x bedrag .
neutral	het_drukwerk wat ze leveren is van zeer goede_kwaliteit_en_het is altijd_snel_geleverd .
neutral	i like square_trade they fix my phone 0 times but i left them with the same problem and never really addressed the issue to correct the phone in the right way due to the bottom_line of the limit of what is the phone worth .
neutral	they where willing to help but never really addressed the problem .
neutral	i was extremely angry with myself when my expensive prescription_sunglasses fell_off of my face while i was swimming in lake michigan .
neutral	they cost me almost two hundred_dollars , even with my insurance .
neutral	i was glad to find this website so that i could order a prescription pair for a quarter of the price .
neutral	the glasses were delivered on time and look great .
neutral	parts arrive lick - a - dee - split , but they didn_'_t fit so had to return them and got stuck fliiping ths bill for return shipping ($_00 ), i think that stinks .
neutral	partstrain pays for return shipping ( fedex ).
neutral	the last part i ordered did not fit my car as it was described .
neutral	i can '_t use it or return it since it has_been just over 00 days .
neutral	i won_'_t use parts_geek again unless they change this policy .
neutral	i only received £_00 , instead of £_000 , even_though my phone was in working order .
neutral	however i feel they should aloud customers to use more colors n patters .
neutral	after all youre paying like almost 000 bucks for them in some_cases .
neutral	your return_policy is far from good .
neutral	broken parts can not be exchanged .
neutral	i had ordered 0 items on separate days .
neutral	the first item was ordered and shipped via_fed_x . i was surprised to find out fed_x took it to the post_office for delivery .
neutral	on checking with the tracking for the post_office , they stated they tried to deliver the item on a saturday and left a note that they would attempt redelivery .
neutral	i received no note or package .
neutral	this delivery did not require a signature or anything and could have been left in the box easily .
neutral	this frustrated me so i sent a re delivery request through the post_office .
neutral	i did get the package on monday through the usps .
neutral	the second item i ordered was delivered on time via_fed_x . i do not understand_why you would choose 0 different delivery services for one package .
neutral	our postal service here stinks to high heaven .
neutral	i would not trust anything going through them .
neutral	i use either fed_x or ups where i know the service is reliable and dependable .
neutral	as far as the parts go they are top_notch and exactly_what i ordered .
neutral	you fill in all of the information only to find out the flight is gone .
neutral	then you try to re book a different flight then you have to fill in all the information again .
neutral	very time_consuming .
neutral	the part i ordered was changed mid production year my vw an parts_geek did not make this clear .
neutral	returns process is not the most user_friendly .
neutral	the identity_guard website is obscure in many ways .
neutral	there are options that are not active and no easy way of knowing if it '_s an extra_cost item .
neutral	there is also no way on their website to downgrade to basic service level from platinum level , which of course costs more .
neutral	just as i posted this a few_minutes ago , i saw through my e_-_mail that they had sent the ran today at 00 : 00_pm .
neutral	i still think that this ticket system is much slower_than a human would have been .
neutral	with most orders i have placed with parts_geek , there have been no_problems ... but when you do have a problem there is no way to reach a person to help you ... email chatter is the black_hole of communication and dosnt do the job , it creates nothing but frustration ... i had bought a radiator from geeks and when i received it there was damage ... packing didnt exsist , it was flopping around inside a empty cardboard_box and delivered to me by ups from somewhere , usa ... trying to reach anyone was futile ... due to time restraints i had to install it and hope it was ok ... after some bending and twisting and other minor repairs it held up .
neutral	i was so ticked off i hadnt bought anything from them in a year ... i just bought something again and pray i dont have anymore headaches .
neutral	press two now isnt working ...... communicate !
neutral	when trying to contact parts_geek , there is no obvious phone_number to call , so i have not placed orders because no one was available to answer_questions about the products .
neutral	never received email_confirmation on purchase or shipping .
neutral	did receive muffler in decent_amount of time though .
neutral	just hope you never have to actually have to talk to them .
neutral	travelocity portion of the transaction was fine .
neutral	after our hotel stay i realized that in addition to travelocity '_s charges the hotel had also charged our credit_card and it took multiple calls for it to get corrected .
neutral	i ordered 0 hood_struts for a 0000_dodge intrepid .
neutral	everything was fine , and the parts were delivered in 0 - days .
neutral	only one problem , one of the hood - struts was broken .
neutral	i followed the instructions and found that i had to ship the broken part back .
neutral	this is a $_00 . 00 part .
neutral	it cost me $_00 . 00 to send it back .
neutral	sure partsgeek will eventually credit my accout for the $_00 . 00 , however i am still out the $_00 . 00 to ship the part back .
neutral	what should have happened is partsgeek should have sent me a replacement part at no charge and paid for the shipping as a courtesy .
neutral	in the mean time , i have been without the second hood_strut for over a week now !
neutral	i am not very happy at this point !
neutral	only problem is with time .
neutral	i was told 0hr 00min .
neutral	service took just under 0hrs .
neutral	if time were more accurately conveyed to me , i would have made appointment or come_back later in the day .
neutral	the end_result is , i was later for another appointment .
neutral	can '_t get through to anyone on the phone , good rates though .
neutral	if phones don_'_t improve won_'_t use next year .
neutral	i live in the middle of no where and my po_box is my best address , i had to use a relative '_s address to get the part to ship , i ended_up just picking it up at the post_office in the next town over .
neutral	please updated your system to allow po_boxes if you are using the postal service .
neutral	the glasses were cheap , and good quality for the price .
neutral	but they sent the wrong_size and never replaced .
neutral	previous purchases entirely trouble_free .
neutral	this one less so .
neutral	some order system error meant it was not delivered on scheduled day .
neutral	it did not arrive on rescheduled day but finally on day after that .
neutral	a lot of waiting in .
neutral	however price and quality good so would use again
neutral	no record in computer of special rates associated with blocked rooms for nelson - smith wedding . wedding .

neutral	parts number0000000 : i order a left and right 0 piece headlight with corner light attached , instead i received instead i received a single headlight without comer light attached from doorman distributer .
neutral	i am not , pleased , with this matter .
neutral	your catalog displayed what i wanted to purchase .
neutral	why is that , i did not get the item your company displayed on website .?
neutral	i received an_email from partgeek displaying such items in stock .
neutral	please , help me resolved this unfortunate mistake .
neutral	thank_you .
neutral	good price but not received my goods yet
neutral	i '_ve made a transfer to a company in china , had confirmation from xendpay that the transfer has_been completed but my payee still has no record of receiving the money a week_later .
neutral	took 0 days to get a swift statement ( which i am not sure whether this proves the money has_been transferred or not ..) so as it stands i don_'_t know whether xendpay are inefficient or the fault is with my payee .
neutral	a previous payment had been cancelled before the funds had left the xendpay account but there is no sign of me having this credited yet despite confirmation that the payment hadn_'_t gone_through .
neutral	overall not sure about this company , as it stands my business is suffering due to the uncertainty with the location of my money
neutral	i run a service company alone .
neutral	i am never at home , and have agreements with every local carrier , including fedex , but the driver kept leaving door tags and taking my parts for a ride .
neutral	i called the office the first day and they said it was a no signature required delivery , and they would tell the driver .
neutral	day 0 , door tag , and my next call , they admitted that my address has a note to leave packages at the door .
neutral	the driver was determined evidently , because the only reason he left the parts was because my daughter was here to sign the ticket that did not need to be signed .
neutral	he told her he was not going to leave the package after all my time on the phone with his company ....... fedex sucks !!!!!!
neutral	!....... parts are great .... thanks .... use ups or postal
neutral	i think it is fair to say that chemical_records is an average website with average customer_services .
neutral	since signing_up roughly 0 years_ago , i have had a couple of bad_experiences that have left me rather unimpressed with their overall service and i now favour other_websites such as red eye records or sounds of the universe etc .
neutral	( there are many others .)
neutral	who have impeccable customer_services .
neutral	the last issue i had i decided not to bother raising with their customer_services after how i was treated on the previous occasion .
neutral	on one occasion , i inquired as to returning a package as i wasn_'_t happy with the condition that it had arrived to me ( no inserts / stiffeners .
neutral	although the handling by the postal service is also to blame ( footprints on the mailer etc .
neutral	i have photos .).)
neutral	and was told to return the package as if this wouldn_'_t be a problem .
neutral	however , upon_contacting them , a senior member of staff told me that he couldn_'_t see any problem with the records and thus i would have to pay for them to be returned to me again .
neutral	my problem here is with their communication between members of their team and also with customers .
neutral	if i had known that a replacement or refund was only conditional i would have considered my situation more but as it stood the member of staff assured me and seemed to take my side readily .
neutral	poor communication .
neutral	the senior member of staff went on to practically accuse me of ordering the vinyl just to rip them onto a digital format and return them to get my money back , despite having been a loyal_customer , giving them what must have amounted to hundreds of pounds over the years .
neutral	i felt_like my loyalty to them meant nothing and to be fair it probably didn_'_t as i am aware of their ongoing popularity and success .
neutral	the senior member of staff admitted that the package wasn_'_t packaged_properly without_any stiffeners / inserts (" packers are told they are meant to put them in ") but i was offered no apology or compensation for this .
neutral	some orders since have also come without stiffeners / inserts , so the problem has clearly not be dealt_with .
neutral	the last order i made with them , one of the records arrived with the paper sleeve ripped down the middle ( being a single , it was only in a single paper sleeve , this is common throughout the industry .)
neutral	and the exposed part of the record covered in surface scratches .
neutral	i was told on the other occasion that their standards meet industry standards , but that particular record is definitely worse off than you would find for sale as first - hand in a record shop .
neutral	i didn_'_t bother to raise this as i felt it would get me nowhere .
neutral	when i have tried to use their " contact us " service , i have also found i have been ignored in the past .
neutral	for such reasons , i now try to avoid the stress of using the website , worrying_about what condition my purchase will arrive in .
neutral	to be fair though , they are comparatively quite cheap and perhaps this is where the true crux of the matter lies .
neutral	if you want peace of mind , i advise you to pay the extra and try another service if you have had similar experiences .
neutral	you will be better off for it .
neutral	purchase wise and sanity wise , knowing that your records have been packaged correctly and that you can contact a service team that you can put more faith in .
neutral	i have found much_better service from other online record retailers that clearly value my custom .
neutral	service was fine , but the part didn_'_t fit , and the shipping and handling to order , and the shipping to send back , is more than the part .
neutral	buyer_beware .
neutral	we ended_up getting our full_refund back on our warranty , but there was alot of hassle involved .
neutral	we weren_'_t told up front when we needed to have our computer inspected that if it was condemned by local techs we would need to send it for verification .
neutral	had we known this we would have just sent it in the first place and saved the hassle of having it inspected locally .
neutral	emails were lost on our account ... calls needed to be made , etc .. like i said , we did end up with our money , but it was a month long process and i '_m just not sure i '_ll do it again .
neutral	i would say overall i would use their service again but they could improve
neutral	on calling customers back , making the ring within the time they say it will be done and understanding what adjustments you are describing to them in the ring renderings .
neutral	they are very friendly and helpful and the overall product turned_out vary good though .
neutral	and the price is right !
neutral	!
neutral	i placed an order for two different items .
neutral	later i received an e_-_mail_stating that my order was cancelled because of a backorder .
neutral	even when i logged on to my account , there were no details on what was backordered - one or both items ?
neutral	i placed another order for the part i really needed and it went through ok .
neutral	i suggest that partsgeek include detailed info , and that info should be included in the e_-_mail notification .
neutral	otherwise , my second order was processed , shipped and delivered quickly .
neutral	the only issue i had was the installation .
neutral	i can '_t remember which step , but one of the steps said something like " tap the ring on ".
neutral	i beat the heck out of that and it never even came close to going on .
neutral	i went to ace hardware and got a pvc 0 " drain and cut the " drain " part out and used that to " tap " the retaining rings into place .
neutral	other than that , great service .
neutral	i think the shipping price is not back .
neutral	some of the item were priced maybe a little high on some things but over all not bad .
neutral	i would could back also tell others ,
neutral	i placed my order on dec 00 0000 , that was a month_ago .
neutral	it still_hasn_'_t arrived .
neutral	i am less_than pleased .
neutral	not an easy site to set to set_up for initial entry .
neutral	drop_off was excellent and they were very helpful when security refused my pen knife .
neutral	found it in the glove box on pick_up .
neutral	great !
neutral	pick_up not so good as we could not find the rep or my car as the rep was wearing normal black clothes and could not be identified .
neutral	only able to leave by combing the car_park for my car !
neutral	the parts were shipped in a box that was too large , and it arrived with the top broken in , as it was sealed with only one piece of tape .
neutral	there was no packing_list to be found , so i don_'_t know if one was shipped or not .
neutral	luckily the contents were unharmed .
neutral	fast service but wrong parts shipped the first time , did receive return_authorization and waiting for hopefully right parts to be shipped on the second go around .
neutral	it appears that person pulling the first order did not read invoice or info written on box .
neutral	i experienced a number of glitches in the system while attempting to navigate and order parking for the upcoming holiday .
neutral	after entering the needed information on 0 separate times , i waited ..... and waited ..... and waited for the system to move me to the next page .
neutral	unfortunately that didn_'_t happen so i had to close out and restart the process 0 times .
neutral	additionally , the fees charged for parking have risen quite a bit since the last time i parked with global ..
neutral	while not as bad as tia onsite parking i am now paying a hefty $_00 for two and one - half days .
neutral	ouch .
neutral	there is a saying that if something is too good to be true , then it probably best left alone .
neutral	these brushes , on first inspection seems to be an exception .
neutral	they are good for the money .
neutral	i have used one of the one inch brushes for applying glue in some biscuit joints , and it did the job very well .
neutral	they could be used in art painting , if you wanted to cover a large area with a wash maybe .
neutral	my only disappointment is that they are rather short at about eight inches long .
neutral	i might use one as a pastry brush !
neutral	if you wanted to use one to apply emulsion paint to a wall , then don_'_t - unless you have a great deal of time and patience .
neutral	i placed an order on sept 00rd on oct 0st no portion of my order had been sent yet .
neutral	tiewraps were not available and the order was being held .
neutral	on earlier orders if an item was not available the remaining items would be shipped , but not this time .
neutral	when i called mcm they were completely apologetic for my trouble and stated that the order would be shipped out asap and i would receive the ($_000 ) order on friday ( oct 0 ), minus the backordered tie wraps .
neutral	i was a little frustrated but satisfied .
neutral	on thursday ( oct 0rd ) i got a call from mcm once again the lady was very polite and then apologetic .
neutral	it seams someone in ohio slipped up and sent the order out ups_ground and i would receive the order on monday ( october 0th ).
neutral	i have ordered almost 00 times and have seldome had an any_issues .
neutral	at_least they are communicating and that is very good , and the women i have spoken to have been as helpful as they could be , they were not at fault .
neutral	my order was wrong and it isn_'_t my fault so why do i have to pay for shipping ?
neutral	good but fees are expensive
neutral	after making a claim there was a long delay before settlement involving a request for medical information ( 00 pages ), misreading the claim form regarding the payment_method and several emails on our part chasing the company for " state of play ". no address or telephone_number was given for the actioning company hence emails and many frustrating automated_responses .
neutral	eventually , after some months of silence , it was settled to our satisfaction but did take a long time and we were looking at the small claims_court .
neutral	this was our first claim so a bit_wary but have renewed as it is a comprehensive , competitive , package .
neutral	i '_ve been driving around with a locked up regulator / motor for months , and so it was relieving to find a place that sells both together for less_than $_000 .
neutral	i got the part in about a week , it took only about 00_minutes to replace , and it works great !
neutral	through my son '_s recommendation , i went on the website to order parts for my daughter '_s car and used the ground_shipping option .
neutral	i did not realize the the price on the website was different than the total charge .
neutral	i am pretty sure that i specifically chose the ground_shipping option .
neutral	because i was going to be out of town on a business trip that morining , i did pay_attention to the final price in the checkout_process .
neutral	to my surprise , i received the parts the very next_day .
neutral	when i went back to balance my checkbook i realized that the total of the parts was way over what the website advertised them for , to include the ground_shipping_costs .
neutral	i have been very busy and have finally had time to sit down and respond to the email sent to me about this service .
neutral	i will go to the website and see if i can find a customer service number that i can call to see about resolving this issue .
neutral	the price was good , so i '_m a happy_camper !
neutral	a suggestion , add a prompt order conformation_email so customers have that warm fuzzy feeling their order didn_'_t end up in a bit hole somewhere .
neutral	the price can '_t be beat .
neutral	very helpful and efficient assistance via chat_feature over the web .
neutral	however completion of phone_calls to our voip gizmo is spotty .
neutral	when we used google_voice to our obi gizmo it worked for years 000_%.
neutral	switched to phonepower a few_months_ago , about 00_% of the phone_calls don_'_t ring through to our home phone .
neutral	i have experienced this because i call my wife from work everyday when i am ready to come home .
neutral	sometimes i call , no answer , hang - up and call again and then my wife answers right_away .
neutral	i hope it gets better .
neutral	they had the best price on auto_parts but i had to wait a week and a half to get them .
neutral	and that with me paying for shipping .
neutral	they have a great selection , and their shipping promos are pretty good .
neutral	highly_recommended .
neutral	all was well until i realized that i had made a mistake on my return date .
neutral	as i prepared to print my boarding pass for the return trip , i realized that i had punched the correct day on the incorrect month .
neutral	travelocity wanted to charge me a total of almost $_000 to correct it .
neutral	i '_ve mucked a few barns in my day .
neutral	( for you city slickers , mucking is the term for shoveling the cow shit out of the barn .)
neutral	even after asking for a supervisor who spoke american english ( none were available ), the cow shit was piled from $_00 up to around $_000 .
neutral	that '_s pretty deep pile of shit isn_'_t it ?
neutral	i resolved it by calling the airline who realized that i had made a mistake .
neutral	i paid only $_00 .
neutral	forrest gump said , " shit happens ."
neutral	i just didn_'_t like it on me .
neutral	see moy review .
neutral	i placed an order for parts for my vehicle with partsgeek and at the moment the order was placed , all items showed available .
neutral	the next_day i received a credit for two items that were not actually available .... no biggie .
neutral	but the two shipments that i received for the balance of the order is where my difficulty started .
neutral	the tracking_number for one of the cartons that was supposed to contain ( 0 ) rotors and a wheel_hub in fact only contained the wheel_hub .
neutral	the weight of the package was shown in the tracking_information as not possibly containing the rotors .
neutral	an exchange of emails this week with them has yet to resolve this to my satisfaction .
neutral	i am still so_far without the rotors that i did pay for and they seem to be confused as to what i am asking for ........ a refund of the purchase price for those rotors .
neutral	i was not able to wait any longer for the parts from partsgeek . com and i purchased them locally .
neutral	beware !!!!!!!!!!!
neutral	do not order from a company that does not even list a phone_number to contact a live_person at !!!!!!!!!
neutral	bad bad bad
neutral	i was disapointed because the map sensor should have come with a new rubber sleeve that fits over the little nipple .
neutral	i had to use the old one .
neutral	the service engine soon light went out today but there should have been a new rubber sleeve / seal for the the part in the box and it was not !
neutral	you guys are willing to make buying easy but returning items is like pulling_teeth .
neutral	ene pæren røk etter 0 uke .
neutral	men_det_er_ikke produktet i seg selv sin feil .
neutral	har hatt problem med flere slike og prøvd forskjellige typer .
neutral	har . nok noe å gjøre med at jeg_har 000w pærer i langlys og de pleier å ryke i kombinasjon med disse .
neutral	anbefaler andre å kjøpe 00w vis de_har h . o . d langlys fra før .
neutral	part was good , shipping time was ok , packaging was inadequate , if the part was not indestructible it would have ben a problem .
neutral	pleased with the service , prompt and efficient .
neutral	a couple pound more than my regular supplier , but i '_m sure a 0 %_discount will bring it in line :- p
neutral	£ 0 for a screw ?, 0 days is " express " delivery , wouldn_'_t like to see slow delivery .
neutral	wouldn_'_t use again unless i was absolutely stuck !
neutral	!
neutral	the car was located in the far end of a civilian parking_lot .
neutral	the staff did not explain adequately where the car was .
neutral	it took three trips to locate the car .
neutral	i was given no heads up as to cost to return core .
neutral	also , no return address_label or info unless i went on line ... again .
neutral	phoning was usless
neutral	super funktionalitet på udstyr , men signalet falder for tit ud .
neutral	ærgeligt at optagerfunktionen er koblet sammen_med_en dårlig filmpakke .
neutral	we bought a hood hinge kit for our jk they arrived scratched and chipped .
neutral	quality control department should inspect prior to shipping
neutral	i saw this cardboard carton on the middle of my lawn with one end split wide open with no tape ( although there was evidence that there had been some kind of tape ).
neutral	i could not determine which carrier actually left it in this condition but luckily the tail_light was still in the bubble bag .
neutral	i have not tried to install so i don_'_t know how it will fit or if the bulbs will fit through their holes , etc .
neutral	bottom_line is : i think i will like your outfit .
neutral	bill williams
neutral	finally getting the best deal and rate was painful as i was given conflicting information by driveaway_holidays .
neutral	each person i spoke with was helpful and polite but as i spoke to different team_members i was given conflicting info .
neutral	and sensed i was being given a bit of a ' runaround '.
neutral	finally booked a car through driveaway with hertz and vehicle was okay - ' newish ' but had a few scratched and dents .
neutral	it ran well , was 0 door and economical which was the vehicle category i selected .
neutral	did hire two other cars while on holiday via another company and both were ' newish ' and in pristine condidtion but possibly just ' the luck of the draw '.
neutral	i understood the terms and conditions and return_policy of the company , however , it would have been nice to have discussed the item , ( of which they only had 0 ).
neutral	i was also considering buying a lens filter / protector .
neutral	because it was a saturday , there was no live_chat or person answering the telephone when i rang .
neutral	the store was shown as being open .
neutral	the telephone switched to answerphone and as prompted i left a message with my contact number for someone to call back .
neutral	i sincerely thought someone would do that , even if it was by the end of that day .
neutral	i appreciate store staff could be busy .
neutral	sadly , a week_later there has not been any contact .
neutral	i did make the purchase of the lens , but decided to buy a filter from another seller .
neutral	in short , if you have an answerphone and request details so you can call the customer back , then do it !
neutral	the item was packaged well and arrived_promptly .
neutral	customer experience let_down by a lack of customer service .
neutral	my digex is not friendly to google , i had to upload the new software for it before i could even use it ,, it is great for reading , heavy to hold , does not have key board to go with it , or a universal cover , the screen_protector was already coming off when i got it .
neutral	very slow to connect with the internet , no matter what browser i am using .
neutral	it is just ok
neutral	my first experience went very good and it was very satisfying . this time i was told my order was being prepared for delivery , but she never received and i never got any explanation . i emailed customer service and was told they would look into it . her_birthday passed and no word . a few_days_later they emailed me i would receive a refund . so disappointing i wanted her to enjoy rather_than a refund . not happy
neutral	good company , good selection but the shipping is way too high
neutral	simple .
neutral	you take far to long to pay out .
neutral	i would like to see ebay become more involved in the process
neutral	booking the ferry was fine .
neutral	i wanted to book meals ( after getting info ).
neutral	no luck
neutral	ive bought several parts from this site .
neutral	quality of parts is amazing .
neutral	i like the fact that you can choose to buy more exspensive aftermarket parts giving you lots of options .
neutral	they have sent
neutral	me wrong parts before .
neutral	and its a hassle to deal with .
neutral	shipping lags too .
neutral	at_least a week .
neutral	and i live a few states away to their parts warehouses .
neutral	part was available , shipping was prompt although i feel that shipping of the mirror switch was costly . i have ordered the side door mirrors , rear tailgate supporters and dual windshield_washer resevoir from your competition and shipping was free for ground delivery but not so with you , which will have me using your competition as my first source for parts in the future for my tahoe .
neutral	we were completely_satisfied with the parts received .
neutral	however , we did receive one incorrect part .
neutral	had immediate_response that the correct part would be shipped 0 - 00 - 00 .
neutral	as of 0 - 0 - 00 , no part , and no response .
neutral	what is happening ???
neutral	?
neutral	apparantly you wont stop sending me emails about giving you a review .
neutral	very annoying .
neutral	everything was great besides the effing 00 emails you have sent me about writing this stupid review
neutral	these specs were very good value .
neutral	but the issues i have with them are :
neutral	0 ) they seem a bit small , all my other glasses have a wider fit .
neutral	0 ) the plastic or acrylic feels very brittle ( only time will tell )
neutral	0 ) the time to deliver seems very slow although probably in spec .
neutral	i am sad and dissapointed because i ordred light brown on line and then called customer service and was told that my order would be changed to grey and then a couple of days_later i recieved the light brown .
neutral	not what i wanted or will ever use !
neutral	i found partsgeek while_searching the internet .
neutral	i was looking for brake_caliper seal_kit and partsgeek came up on the search .
neutral	the website was straight_forward finding my model year truck .
neutral	the break down of pricing and vendors was nice to have .
neutral	the options and the notes of the parts were detailed in specs .
neutral	they have good pictures of the parts .
neutral	so i ordered some parts and received them in a few_days .
neutral	but i did not get my entire seal_kit .
neutral	i was sent one bag with two seals and the picture and description indicated it was a kit for the rear showing four seals ?
neutral	the website communicates by email to resolve concerns .
neutral	i have had some good experience with yesstyle .
neutral	they have had some shipping problems but always follow through with what ever fix they give me over the phone .
neutral	great prices , good parts .
neutral	the parts came from multiple_warehouses .
neutral	two packages showed_up in a couple days however the third package took over a week .
neutral	if i ' d have known it was going to be that slow i would have bought local .
neutral	but .... very poor customer_services
neutral	not the best customer_services hard to understand the saftey demo on the flight but very cheap and better_than the other low_cost airlines
neutral	i ordered a trackclip pro on the 0th september for £_00 . 00 and payment was taken from my card on the following_day .
neutral	the website stated 0 - 0 days for delivery yet i ' d received nothing by the 00th so i chased via the online_chat and got no answer although i did receive an_email later advising they were waiting from the distributor to re - stock so fair enough i waited .
neutral	on the 0th_november i tried the online_chat to check the whereabouts of my order , having got no response to that request ( bearing in mind the website was still saying 0 - 0 days for deliver ) i asked if i cancel my order would i still get a refund .
neutral	i was not asking to cancel the order but that is what proviation did .
neutral	the cancellation email advised that a refund would take 0 - 00 working days however on the 0th working day my bank had seen no sign of the refund and stated it should only take 0 - 0 days in their opinion , so i emailed proviation who asked me to leave it another 00 - 00_hours and they would manually escalate of not received .
neutral	i left it a further 0 days and still no refund so i asked if they intended to actually refund .
neutral	00 days after that i still had received no refund so i emailed again where i was now being told that a cheque would be sent .
neutral	that was a week_ago and now my emails are not being responded too .
neutral	in the meantime i ordered a trackclip pro off [_external reference_] and it arrived the following_day , i know who i '_ll be shopping with in future .
neutral	*** update **** 00 / 00 / 0000
neutral	since my original review proviation has_been in contact with me on a number of occasions and have explained that they were experiencing issues with the bank they used to process their card transactions .
neutral	proviation sent me a screenshot of the refund request they made on the 0th_november when the order was cancelled .
neutral	this does support their statement that the lack of refund progress was due to the bank and not their systems which would explain_why several other people were also complaining_about refunds during the same time period .
neutral	during the recent email conversations proviation re - issued the refund by cheque ( my choice ) which has now successfully cleared to my account .
neutral	proviation believes that they have turned a corner now and i hope that they have and wish them all the best .
neutral	i just wish that there had been clear and more frequent communication during this issue rather_than after a negative_review had been posted .
neutral	and the website must accurately_reflect your stock situation with updates if the item is on back order with a supplier .
neutral	you have great pricing on bottles yet your shipping is astronomical !
neutral	secondly improve your corks .
neutral	0 / 00 bottles leak using your corks and some are broken when they arrive
neutral	good friendly service throughout !
neutral	but was fed up with the fluctuation of the delivery date .
neutral	it made me feel that once i had signed on the dotted line my importance was zero ' d .
neutral	reception coverage is never great but their desperation to keep you with them means they offer some good deals
neutral	hi i am using hw d com since 0 years for my trips to the americas , asia and within europe .
neutral	and i was satisfied very much in the beginning .
neutral	during the last two years i had to realise , that many good our even very goot hostels and homestays no_longer work together with hw d com .
neutral	the reasen i was told is , that the hw d com margin is to high , especially for bookers longer_than 0 days .
neutral	this might be one of the reasons , that hw d com lists more and more hotels in the lower quality range , so to speek no hostel or homestay type .
neutral	i hopße the management will change there marginpolicy and the good ho and ho will come_back .
neutral	hw d comso far is the best booking system i know .
neutral	frank
neutral	i , m very happy with petflow with the following exceptions .
neutral	one , it was indicated somewhere that you would add a product if you didn_'_t offer it .
neutral	i requested that you offer large size dentastix from pedigree .
neutral	the person i talked to made it seem like like it was up to me to check the list to see if was added .
neutral	in other_words , lip service .
neutral	the product is still not on the list .
neutral	and two , your system of sending the orders out at a specific interval leaves something to be desired .
neutral	i by phone had requested that an order not be shipped until i released it .
neutral	i then received a e_-_mail saying the order was shipping in a week .
neutral	not good .
neutral	the problem appears to be straightened_out now .
neutral	i thought the jumpers would have been thicker i didn_'_t understand the weight they quoted so i have returned one but kept the other as it will go under a jacket .
neutral	its a pity they couldn_'_t have explained that they were thin and only suitable for the summer .
neutral	they look good quality however .
neutral	they should write to me again in a few_months and then i can tell them how it is wearing .
neutral	everything was fine but the whole_experience was let_down as there were no instructions in the box .
neutral	the video on the website helps but as i don_'_t build this racking daily it took a bit of working out .
neutral	the first lot of shelves were a bit of a struggle but when i had worked out what to do the second set were easy .
neutral	with some basic instructions the whole_process would have been simple .
neutral	good , but see_above .
neutral	more economical !
neutral	the on - line hiring was fairly simple but it is not until you have made the booking that you can see what is included .
neutral	in my case , i saw that the car was supplied with a full_tank but it was not until i was at the alamo desk that i realised that the fuel needed paying for locally .
neutral	this cost more than the one day hire i had booked .
neutral	i think a one day hire should have provoked a warning on fuel charged and i would have then chosen a more inclusive rarif with argus
neutral	that phone of theirs will ring off the hook .
neutral	they never call back in reasonable time .
neutral	the e_-_mail response 0 days .
neutral	i have had problems in the past .
neutral	i have credit i can '_t get .
neutral	but their prices are best
neutral	it is very nice to have access to asian_fashion and other geeky gadgets , but it is a pity that the shipping & return is so expensive .
neutral	they don_'_t give you refund either , so you end up buying stuff that you adore but don_'_t need anyway .
neutral	i have not yet received the item .
neutral	lets_see how it goes .
neutral	lol .
neutral	first time used donot have any opinion yet
neutral	i should have received my order by now and have not
neutral	very good site , where you can find qickly all spare parts for your motorcycle .
neutral	the delivering is slow , could be better
neutral	i like the page , and the service ( although online ) is trust_worthy .
neutral	what i don_'_t like is that there is a fee for activating a xbox or ps card , usually $ 0 . 0 and it '_s unacceptable given several sites sell you online codes at their retail price .
neutral	for example , [_external link_removed_] sells $_00 psn_cards at $_00 .
neutral	i don_'_t just don_'_t get why i have to pay more money for less .
neutral	order a set of 0 wind reflectors for a 0door focus , the front were fine but the back were too small , after pointing this out i had to take pictures up against the car , give me registration plate then send the items back , i was then told it was a mistake by the manufacture and had to wait around 0_weeks for a new set to be dispatched from poland , when i finally recieved the item back they were still too small , i did not complain again as i didn_'_t want to wait and mess about packaging and shipping the item so i put them in the bin and forgot about it
neutral	car_rental in portugal ( muitiauto / internationalcar rental company ) are not following the contract with economy_car_rentals ... therefore charging extra well above the agreement ...( i '_ve got charged extra 000_euros due fuel )... they didn_'_t get the original ordered car ... they give an substitute ..( they had the original car next to the substitute and gave to another customer after me ,... when i ask about .... they said we gonna give you an substitute ).. very bad_experience this time ...
neutral	i was wanting more of a credit_monitoring site , this seems to have reports but is more geared toward identity
neutral	next_day delivery took 0 days .
neutral	parts were bent , tubes were scratched , bolts were badly - cast and the logo on the padded back rest was very shabby .
neutral	if i hadn_'_t been so determined to assemble it for my mother on that day , i would have sent for a set of inspected bolts or returned it for a refund at your expense .
neutral	how anyone claims that the r . r . p was 000_pounds is absolutely beyond me .
neutral	i have however , with replacement bolts , assembled the table , so not everything is lost .
neutral	disappointed .
neutral	i bought two_pairs of glasses , and placed the order on september 0th .
neutral	i was immediately sent an_email_asking me to confirm my prescription which i did immediately , however a response was not forthcoming after having sent two emails over the space of a week .
neutral	the call_centre was never available and i began to suspect a scam .
neutral	i eventually got through to a csr who assured me that the prescription was correct , the order was filled and the glasses were dispatched shortly_after .
neutral	when they arrived , the prescription was incorrect .
neutral	i corresponded with the csr again and he was extremely_helpful in ensuring that i was able to return the glasses to be checked and they refunded me the cost of p_&_p and eventually , after almost a month of having placed the order , the glasses finally arrived .
neutral	the overall experience was painful , and unfortunately , the lack of availability until after a problem had arisen was a sticking point , even_though they rectified the problem very quickly .
neutral	the cost in very reasonable , but because of problems like these , it becomes problematic to manage the online purchase of such products .
neutral	even since you cannot see how the glasses fit your expectations on style and quality may not be achieved .
neutral	if i need a cheap pair to run around with that i don_'_t mind thrashing , i '_ll happily buy again , but if i need glasses urgent or am looking for a decent pair , i '_ll go to the shop and try them on and spend a bit more to know what i '_m getting .
neutral	the product was meant to be delivered on timed delivery between_0am - 00noon on the monday it was 00_minutes late .
neutral	the delivery driver told me he had not been told to delivery it by 00noon despite it telling him on the box .
neutral	littlewoods refunded the delivery charge of £ 0 . 00 but i will not order anything on timed delivery again .
neutral	you take too_long to process orders
neutral	mcm took_longer_than i wanted to ship .. other than that all is fine .
neutral	ordered a filler piece under head_light it came in a large box no packing no packing_slip taped poorly .
neutral	i got three items for my son as i spent a little more to get free delivery .
neutral	the items and delivery were as expected and packaging was great .
neutral	however , customer_services response to their price match promise was they don_'_t pricematch .
neutral	that it the only_thing that let_down my experience , why_advertise something that you don_'_t actually offer .
neutral	wait_until you get the items before you give any recomendations
neutral	cuando vaya por dinamarca , y este , te lo diré .
neutral	gracias
neutral	web_site sez 00 hour response to problems and took 0 days .
neutral	finally got the rma need and they will not pay for the return even_though it was their fault .
neutral	the mistake cost me $ 0000 . 00 to purchase the parts locally , three_times the cost from parts_geek .
neutral	yllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll
neutral	competitive advertised prices - check internet / print ads .
neutral	i ordered a number of guitar pedals though the gak website , one in particular was displayed as an_older " more desireable " model , when i recieved the product it was the newer less impressive version .
neutral	there was no communication explaining that this was being sent instead of the one shown .
neutral	the delivery itself was great , and i was very happy with the rest of the order , i would not recommend people buy pedals from this retailer if they are fussy about the version you desire ( i '_m fussy in this respect ).
neutral	wait on phone was too_long .
neutral	i think someone mismarked the shirts .
neutral	one xlt looked like a 0x . i am sorry it didn_'_t work out --- maybe next time .
neutral	i have been a customer of pcgamesupply for well over a year now .
neutral	i have had very little trouble with them .
neutral	once i reached my monthly limit of $_000 . 00 they wouldn_'_t raise it , even_though i have never had a dispute against them .
neutral	i had to find another site that sold the card that i needed , and that was on offgamers . com .
neutral	my month was up , and i could go back to pcgamesupply , but offgamers offered something pcgamesupply didn_'_t have .
neutral	a loyalty_program .
neutral	i ended_up getting 0 %_off on all the purchased on offgamers and i was awarded points .
neutral	once i reached a certain threshold i can redeem for a store credit .
neutral	once pcgamesupply does something like this , i will be staying with offgamers .
neutral	i ordered a heat_pump , line sets , the pump came quickly but the line sets haven_'_t come yet and it '_s been 0_weeks , and it '_s been 00_degrees out .
neutral	would have been ice to have this installed bynow
neutral	part does not fit my 0000 jetta even_though it lists as an oem replacement .
neutral	which isn_'_t a big_deal .
neutral	return_policy is 0 hassle but shipping a return is on my dime .
neutral	which seems a little_iffy because i used their program to pick the part and according to that program it should fit .
neutral	so i '_m out 0 . 00 in return shipping .
neutral	this is my only_complaint ( other than the part not being for my car ) return_policy will prevent me from using them again .
neutral	too many other_places provide free return shipping for incorrect shipped parts .
neutral	we were lead to believe that we were renting a mercedes a - class or similar .
neutral	we got a skoda roomster .
neutral	no disrespect for the skoda brand , it has served_us well in the past , but there is no comparison .
neutral	the 0 . 0l engine was underpowered for the fast paced european highways and that was especially noticeable when overtaking semi '_s at > 00 km / h .
neutral	the cars ' appearance and the service from the people at the desk in zaventem airport was however impeccable , no_complaints there at all .
neutral	as i said , the idea is very good , the service is very good and trustworthy .
neutral	no_complaints about that .
neutral	the price is fine and the way of configurating is easy and with all the choices i need .
neutral	the quality you get at the end of the day is fine by material but not very good in the way it is manufactured .
neutral	if we ´ re_talking good fit , straight good lines and so on i ´_m disappointed .
neutral	if i find the time i ´ ve to send back 0 out of 0 shirts .
neutral	bra_pris , fick mina grejor och hemsidan funkade fint så mycket mer att säga !
neutral	original order out of stock , agreed to an_alternative , once my 0 tyres removed there was only 0 in stock , an old tyre had to be refitted along with 0 new one '_s , had to make another visit when the 0th tyre was in stock but staff apologised & did the 0nd fitting very quick .
neutral	i never completed my signup and asked that if you show a membership to cancel it because i never authorized activation !
neutral	you sent me the wrong front shocks the back were fine time of delivery was ok
neutral	had to send back an hei ign .
neutral	would not fire .
neutral	ordered a bestop soft top for my 00 cj0 , received a set of sliding doors for a wrangler yj . now have to wait_until the wrong part is received at your facility before the right part will be shipped out . took 0_weeks to get the replacement for the hei don_'_t know if it works yet , havn '_t installed it yet still running on the old points ign .
neutral	only apologies offered for your screw up . ordered knobs for heater controls your guy looked up for me . shipped the wrong stuff , but i made it work .
neutral	i have bought all of the jeep parts that i have used from 0wd .
neutral	haven_'_t even looked anywhere_else .
neutral	maybe i should .
neutral	hi there :
neutral	in regard to the delivery of screen to my place , it was within the agreed_upon time .
neutral	but unfortunately and after i have installed the screen on my laptop , the upper right corner from the top has dark shadow , which means has some kind defect .
neutral	that '_s my experience with this purchase ...
neutral	cheers ;
neutral	gus
neutral	i bought an ultimate_game card on pcgamesupply , delivery was real fast .
neutral	but i buy prepaid credit_card to make my purchase online .
neutral	problem is once you made a transaction on this website it lock you and force you to always use the same credit_card .
neutral	so since i use prepaid_cards i will not be able to buy on their website again .
neutral	local prices are above_average .
neutral	bland coffe not individual wrapped disappointed .
neutral	the sander i bought was half the worx price , but on arrival and hidden in the instructions it says " only for light use " so be warned if you need it for continuous use buy the worx .
neutral	light use is fine for me .
neutral	this information was lacking in the online description .
neutral	i have yet to use the product so i will post a better review when used .
neutral	very easy to use web_site .
neutral	left the box at my local collection_point but it took almost two_weeks to get to the depot .
neutral	then another two_weeks to get paid .
neutral	having said that i would use the service again .
neutral	i suggest that mm tell prospective sellers how long it will take to get the cash a lot of sales are distress sales and the cash is needed urgently .
neutral	the representative doesn_'_t seem to know the areas where hotels are located .
neutral	the pricing is high for the location and accommodations .
neutral	i '_ve stayed there before and i wasn_'_t impressed with the hotel .
neutral	i '_m only staying at the hotel because my high is having its reunion there .
neutral	i wouldn_'_t recommend the hotel to my friends .
neutral	never once received confirmation of order placed online , or shipment of order .
neutral	otherwise item was as_described and online ordering was easy .
neutral	seemed to take to long to receive item .
neutral	did not make it in time to be given as a christmas_gift as intended .
neutral	but that could have been ups issue there is no way to tell because no emails were ever sent stating the item was shipped .
neutral	showed_up 0 days after christmas .
neutral	although it was convenient to not have to worry_about my clubs until i arrived at the golf_course , not sure it was worth $_00 for the convenience .
neutral	ups also damaged my new travel bag , ripping one of the carry straps off .
neutral	ship_sticks did recommend a box for soft cases without hard base plates , but my case had a hard base_plate so it seemed unnecessary for me to pay for a box on top of everything else .
neutral	ship_sticks did send me a delivery confirmation_email indicating the arrival of my clubs to the golf_course .
neutral	unfortunately , that email arrived 0 days late , after i had already returned from my golf trip .
neutral	fortunately , i had just used ups_tracking to determine their arrival to the course , again making ship_sticks feel less valuable .
neutral	i ordered two rack shelves , a 0u wall - mount frame and three patch panels .
neutral	the box looked ok on delivery , but evidently had been dropped as one of the mounting ears on one patch panel was slightly_bent ( i was able to manually straighten it ), and both the rack shelves had sustained damage ( scratches and one shelf bowed ).
neutral	not enough to warrant the pain of returning them , but annoying nonetheless .
neutral	i have used comms_express before , but mostly for patch leads , not hardware .
neutral	i ' d be wary of inadequate packing in future .
neutral	i received my purchase last_week .
neutral	the packing_slip in the box had another persons name ( sold to ) but the description was correct .
neutral	the total charge was also incorrect , the packing_slip had a total of $_000 . 00 which was more than my quote .
neutral	lso it was shipped to my billing_address , but it was sent to 00 elm street instead of 00 elm street
neutral	i ordered art craft art - bilt 000 - 0000 rimway with cable temples near feb 0 , 0000 .
neutral	before delivery i noticed i made an error .
neutral	emailed to see if not too_late to amend or .
neutral	got an ok .
neutral	so amended order arrives , but is incorrect : skull temples instead of cable .
neutral	emailed for directions on to return .
neutral	still_waiting .
neutral	cant_beat the prices they have a wide_selection of parts definitely well stocked it there were additional money saving perks possibly i dont want to sound greedy but hey why not offer shipping discounts would score five_stars but the shipping is god awful i should say the packaging everything usually is on time it just seems like either they got children , really lazy people , or monkeys that package the parts i actually laugh when i see the package and laugh even harder saying things like how did that possibly make it here or how did they make it fit or are you effin kidding me for example when a set of rotors came in they came in a nearly empty oversized_box bouncing off each other the entire journey to me i assumed by the look of them they are coated with a paint btw so it was obvious ( zimmerman rotors ) it wont stop me from buying from them but thats because i take risks and dont have tons of dough
neutral	shame they were not waiting for us when we arrived at the drop_off point , called twice , friendly guys and apologetic , traffic not good but not the point if they were waiting at drop_off point wouild have given you top_marks as return was excellent called and they pulled up as we walked out to collect car , shame on departure that no one to meet and waited for quite a while .
neutral	never mind holiday was good .
neutral	might use again but not sure , important that holiday starts and finishes on a positive note !!

neutral	replacement ' compatible ' cartridges for epson_printer wouldn_'_t work .
neutral	shipping via ' couriers please ' was much less convenient than aust post as eventual delivery ( i collected ) took two_days longer .
neutral	previous compatible canon cartridges were good as was aust post delivery .
neutral	this is the second time that i have purchased glasses , i have also recommended it to family after my first purchase .
neutral	however my second order took much longer , after using the online contact options i asked for updates which took_forever , answering : that they had technical problems .
neutral	i waited then tried using the telephone_numbers listed on yell . com this was either permanent fax on tel line or sorry mail box full you cannot leave a message .
neutral	they eventually arrived .
neutral	in short value for money but be prepared to wait , with limited or no contact !
neutral	i would use again
neutral	i have been a part of yahoo fantasy_football before and they have an app you can download on your phone where stats are updated immediately ( you dont have to wait_until sunday_night to see where you stand ).
neutral	you can also make_changes to your lineup on the fly ( maybe if you were on your phone in line at starbucks ).
neutral	nice people -- good prices , but , my most_recent order of the cat '_s urinary diet food still_hasn_'_t arrived . i gave 0_stars reluctantly but two stars seemed a little harsh .
neutral	overpriced goods
neutral	good to have so many options when looking for a place to go .
neutral	last_minute helps me out of a bind many_times and well_worth you to check out .
neutral	great prices and good quality information .
neutral	there is an occasional deal on something that interests me , but not very often -- once in 0 - 0 months .
neutral	the added fee on the " advertised " price is very high
neutral	the tail_light part was delivered on time and matched the factory specs .
neutral	easy to install in 00_minutes .
neutral	crack on lens at bottom was disappointing but not worth trying to hassle returning and waiting another month for replacement during this christmas_rush .
neutral	i would order again from this company but be more discerning about returns .
neutral	as the saying goes " you don_'_t always get what you pay for but you sure do pay for what you get !"
neutral	selection good , service good , fine_print sux would rather deal with rockauto
neutral	i ordered the solar garden gnome lights - 0 pack for my wife '_s birthday .
neutral	by chance someone_else also ordered a pack so we ended_up with 0 .
neutral	unfortunately in one pack two of the three gnomes had become separated from their hats , and in the second pack one .
neutral	so 00_% of the items were damaged .
neutral	in fairness they were simple enough to repair but you need to inspect these prior to delivery .
neutral	i believe it was an easy way to get a loan however , they are certainly robbing you when it comes back to repaying it over several_years .
neutral	you eand up paying back more than three_times the amount you loan .
neutral	if i were in the position to loan people money and secure it through the vehicle they own , i would only want about 00_% per year .
neutral	ie : £ 0000 over 00 months would be £_000 for year 0 and £_000 for year 0 .
neutral	so , basically you tell the customer up front that they are not being robbed and the should be able to afford the loan repayments of £_000 . 00 a month .
neutral	i have used hrs for many_years and have found it to be a good site .
neutral	recently when i bring up the map to find hotel locations -- it is cluttered with these boxes of " tourist sites .'
neutral	these boxes covered the map making it very difficult to find hotels and streets and almost_impossible to use .
neutral	unless this changes , i will cease to use hrs and start using other more " map friendly " sites .
neutral	it '_s ok , the google account would not log me on , i had to change to another account .
neutral	part on website said new but when arrived it was a reconditioned part
neutral	we ordered a hood and bumper for my son '_s car , which had been in an accident .
neutral	the parts were difficult to find , so we were glad to find partsgeek , which had the parts we needed , at a reasonable price .
neutral	the parts are now installed and we are very happy with them .
neutral	my only problem was with the shipping .
neutral	i received an_email when the parts shipped , along with a tracking_number .
neutral	when i went to the link , which took me to echo transportation , the only information it really gave_me was that the parts had been picked_up and were expected to be delivered by march_0th .
neutral	every time i went to the link , there was no change and no additional information .
neutral	so i went back to my email and called the number given for if your parts shipped " by truck ".
neutral	the woman i got there had no_idea where my shipment was and could find no information on it with the reference_number i had .
neutral	so on march_00th , i submitted a request for support to partsgeek on their web_site .
neutral	two_days_later , i received an_email back from them , simply giving me a phone_number to call to schedule delivery .
neutral	the number was for the local abf facility , which informed me that they did have my parts and we scheduled delivery for the next_day .
neutral	i have to say i was very frustrated with the lack of information about where my parts were and when they would arrive .
neutral	if i had not submitted my help request , i '_m not sure how i would have received my merchandise .
neutral	it was extremely frustrating .
neutral	parts_geek was great , until i received my order and found two items missing .
neutral	so i contacted parts_geek and after being on hold for 00_minutes i finally spoke to a rep and he personally contacted the warehouse about the shortage .
neutral	i received the items the next_day .
neutral	i then felt_confident to place yet another order to which has not shipped yet .
neutral	i am hoping to have better luck with my second order .
neutral	bonjour
neutral	dans mes reservations vous m ' envoyez tout en allemand .
neutral	je_ne parle pas allemand puisque je_suis en suisse romand ( français )
neutral	s ' il vous plait , il_faut m ' envoyer mes reservations en français .
neutral	merci d ' avance
neutral	the part was shipped expeditiously and was fine but never got nor could i find an address or instructions to ship a core back to you for a rebate .
neutral	then , cant get a human on the phone !!
neutral	very stressful ..
neutral	the part i received was a different manufacture than ordered , which was ok , but i paid for a more_expensive one , but per their terms of service i need to pay return shipping regardless of " fault ", so i wonder_if it was a little bait and switch .
neutral	regardless the part i ordered fit so it isnt the end of the world , but i would seek other options before ordering again .
neutral	work looks excellent .
neutral	found 0 mistake .
neutral	called 000 number .
neutral	no one available .
neutral	left message .
neutral	please call back asap .
neutral	0000000000 .
neutral	any discounts for lost time .
neutral	wanted to send translations to customs asap .
neutral	i bought a pair of extra reading_glasses ,.
neutral	they were very cheap , but i think that the optical quality of the lenses is not perfect .
neutral	good price and friendly service but the tyre pressure warning_light came on a little later in the day so i had to turn_around and head back to my nearest petrol_station .
neutral	i checked the tyre pressure and they were slightly under - inflated according to the recommended levels .
neutral	the reason the warning_light came on was because the system hadn_'_t been re - set as it should have been when the tyres were fitted .
neutral	the tyres are run flats and i think the fitters should have known to re - set the tyre pressure monitor .
neutral	the prices are good but , i wanted to edit the amount to order more after i entered the payment information and i didn_'_t see an option .
neutral	i had to re - submit all of my information all over again .
neutral	you can always find the products you are looking for at a lower price .
neutral	however , supplementwarehouse more than makes up for this lower price in how much they charge for shipping .
neutral	i still don_'_t know what i signed_up for in terms of what collateral is being used to secure this money , and your customer service folks don_'_t seem to know .
neutral	customer service has_been so so , ultimately i get help but sometimes it takes a lot of back and forth .
neutral	product as_described , correct part , fast shipping , but poor packaging ( box was torn and half - opened , no foam either , just wobbling there ).
neutral	considering i '_ve ordered a body part replacement that was a significant issue for me .
neutral	products are good however prices have escalated and i will be looking elsewhere .
neutral	couldn_'_t remember my pasword , so i requested a change , then i changed a password to an 00 character generated password .
neutral	it appeared to let_me do it , then when i tried to log it , it said 00 characters was the max .
neutral	not only should you not let people save passwords that you won_'_t accept later , but you really shouldn_'_t limit the password length ( except maybe something really big , like 000 chars )
neutral	the price was right , but the packaging was incorrect for the product .
neutral	the plastic liner was rolled up and placed into a box .
neutral	the rolling caused a crack on one edge of the plastic liner .
neutral	the product also did not come with any hardware for installation .
neutral	this service was quick but when i sent the money to pay for a service i thought all fees were included .
neutral	the other party sent me an_email_saying i still had an out standing $_00 . 00 to pay as the bank i sent the money to charged a fee .
neutral	it would had been nice to have known this before sending the money in which case , i would have still used azimo and i would have given them an extra star !
neutral	the other party is happy for me to make up the difference when i am there , otherwise if i had to send the money i would have to pay more transaction fees !
neutral	we have been , and continue to be , customers of travelocity .
neutral	bottom_line , they get you the lowest_prices for air , hotel , car , etc .
neutral	they are great at what they do .
neutral	but my only advice in working with this service : don_'_t change your plans , because it '_s clear they are locked in with their products and cannot move things around , or for any reason need to speak with a supervisor to resolve a situation , you will be put on hold for hours , as the regular clerks ( staring at a screen , probably in some other country ) are powerless to make a decision .
neutral	it gives the impression there is a definite strategy to delay service and frustrate the customer to the point where they give up .
neutral	it '_s absolutely awful second level customer service .
neutral	so you get what you pay for -- if you are not rock - solid sure of your plans -- book elsewhere .
neutral	i first used petflow thanks to a groupon last month .
neutral	because it '_s still about $_00 cheaper_than buying at the store even without a groupon , i '_ve stuck with it .
neutral	so_far , i '_ve had 0 deliveries .
neutral	like others have said , they botched the charge on my credit_card for the first order , but it '_s been fine since .
neutral	they were kind & helpful about it on the phone when i called to address the charge .
neutral	i do like this as a cheaper option , & a more convenient one since it saves me a trip to the store .
neutral	but i have a few significant complaints that make me say : you get what you pay for .
neutral	i ' d recommend it , but only half - heartedly .
neutral	( 0 ) poor packaging quality .
neutral	every_single shipment i '_ve received has included damaged cans of dog_food .
neutral	every one .
neutral	the cans are crushed in transit because the packaging isn_'_t high_quality .
neutral	these cans are tough to open .
neutral	( 0 ) no warnings about price hikes on repeat orders .
neutral	to me , this is an honesty / integrity issue .
neutral	i think petflow owes it to repeat_customers to warn them if the cost rises on an item they '_ve signed_up to receive regularly .
neutral	that way customers can make informed_decisions about whether to continue the service .
neutral	good service , but a little_slow in shipping .
neutral	shipping cost $ 0 . 0 and charged customer $_00 . 00 .
neutral	some other company charge shipping lower_than you .
neutral	website easy to use , order was dealt_with quickly and medals arrived in good time .
neutral	i am disappointed with the engraving though - the three lines of text were different_sizes which didn_'_t look as good as i hoped .
neutral	after a dozen or so good experiences , this one got the job_done but was a hassle on my end .
neutral	i ordered a water_pump and a gasket for the pump .
neutral	the gasket arrived within a few_days , but was for the wrong_size engine i was installing on .
neutral	the water_pump arrived a few_days_later and had a gasket in the box which was correct .
neutral	this wasn_'_t in the details when i made the purchase but a nice surprise .
neutral	as for the other item , it feels_like i would be losing money for an item that price to take the time to get an_rma #, package it , send it , etc .... but on the other hand it is a few_bucks wasted .
neutral	decent prices with decent selection of products .
neutral	bought a sri for my 0000 civic and didn_'_t get the choice of choosing the trim and ended_up buying the wrong intake for my car .
neutral	had to pay shipping to ship it back , just wished parts_geek was like other online retail_stores that paid for shipping for a small mistake .
neutral	i know it '_s on my part for the mistake but the site could '_ve had more options to be more specific on part selections ( having them on the mobile site would be helpful too ).
neutral	anyways overall a neutral experience with parts_geek , just wish they could have helped with the return shipping .
neutral	looking at the right product that i need to buy , but looks_like i '_ll be buying and recommending street side auto that has never let_me down .
neutral	booked car for our portugal holiday which we collected at faro_airport .
neutral	we had a problem on our 00 . 00 return flight because there was nobody at the yor van to drop_off the car until 0 . 00 and by the time we had cleared security we almost missed our flight .
neutral	when we picked_up the car we asked if we could drop_off the car at 0 . 00 as our flight was at 00 . 00 .
neutral	we were told that there would be a charge of 00 euros for doing this .
neutral	there was no mention of this when we made the booking with holidayautos !
neutral	update_: i did end up getting a call after i posted this review .
neutral	i won_'_t mention the ladies name , but she was great to work with !
neutral	got the charges reversed and gave_me a discount .
neutral	she even called my bank with me .
neutral	i was very impressed .
neutral	i changed the review since stuff happens .
neutral	just wish it wouldn_'_t have eaten up so much of my time .
neutral	here is my story ... last evening around 0 my time i went to make a purchase of a new automatic pool vacuum and a few other miscellaneous supplies .
neutral	the order came to just shy of $_000_dollars .
neutral	i went through the usual steps and hit_submit payment .
neutral	after clicking the button i received and error " problem with your payment , please try again ".
neutral	so i verified all my information was entered correctly and tried again .
neutral	i got the same error .
neutral	i verified everything and tried again .
neutral	same error .
neutral	so , i thought to myself forget this .
neutral	i went to the grocery_store after and my card was declined .
neutral	how embarrassing ... after logging_into my bank i see that my card was charged 0 times by doheny '_s for almost 000 each !!
neutral	right_away i called the company and i got a live_person , but it turns_out they didn_'_t have anyone there from customer service and this person could only take order .
neutral	the person did say they could take a message and have someone call me first thing in the morning .
neutral	they opened at 0 am central time .
neutral	i left a message explaining what happened .
neutral	i then called my bank explaining what happened and they said for the first 00_hours that i needed to work with the merchant and to call back after .
neutral	so , an_hour later i have no money and my house payment is supposed to go through that night ...
neutral	after my alarm clock went of this morning , i still had not received a phone_call from doheny .
neutral	i called them and did get a customer service rep . she seemed like she wanted to help , but said only one lady processes credit_card payments and she was busy , but she insured me that she did talk to her and they would make it a top priority to get it canceled before things ran for the day .
neutral	for some reason that left a bad_taste in my mouth and i wasn_'_t sure why .
neutral	sure thing that bad_taste was correct .
neutral	hours_later and i have still not heard_anything .... my house payment did not go through because i have no money in my account .
neutral	the customer service lady said she could not give me any discounts to make up for those charges , so i said just cancel all three payments .... none of this is resolved at this moment ..
neutral	sales people very slow getting back with quotes ... not as bad this time , but something to work on ... i don_'_t really see why quotes can '_t come_back immediately ?
neutral	i was glad to use local repair services rather_than having to part with my laptop for up to 0_weeks .
neutral	however , the reimbursement still has not happened correctly .
neutral	it has_been almost 0 months , 0 - 0 phone_calls from me to squaretrade , and they have once sent the payment to the wrong paypal e_-_mail address .
neutral	i would use them again , but this aspect of payment processing could be improved .
neutral	i had a chat session with one of the cashnet associates .
neutral	she explained everything to me .
neutral	i was pleased with the information given .
neutral	thank_you cashnet .
neutral	be very careful who u speak with .
neutral	get the name date .
neutral	had a mishap that should not of happen .
neutral	yes well we picked the vehicle up at the airport , nice surprise we had a renault_megane nice car .
neutral	megan sat in the front of the megane , wow what a car .
neutral	stopped for a bight to eat and found mud under the car body and around wheel arches .
neutral	also in the engine .
neutral	travelled into the city of melbourne megan got bitten by the ants that came out of the doors and on the front dash board .
neutral	nasty big red bit mark , sore for a few_days .
neutral	really nice car bad_experience .
neutral	time from order to time shipped is too_long .
neutral	product is as_advertised and is satisfactory .
neutral	screwed_up with my password , ( unnecessarily complicated format ), n then couldn_'_t log in , still can '_t , password not accepted .
neutral	so requested help changing it n got this email with uber long link that doesn_'_t work .
neutral	wasn_'_t usual sorta link one gets in an_email to remember / change password , no short highlighted link , great long useless thing .
neutral	tried copying / cuttting , pasteing , no go .
neutral	i tried contact hostelworld but nada zilch , no response .
neutral	hopeless .
neutral	i still can '_t log in !!!
neutral	!
neutral	otherwise useful site to book on but i still can '_t access their myworld site .
neutral	would star it higher but this is spoiler for me .
neutral	i got an exhaust_manifold and the price was unbeatable but on the description i understood it was coming with studs and nuts ... well it didn_'_t so i was a little disappointed but for the price i couldn_'_t complain so i just went to autozone and bought them , which wasnt that bad .
neutral	all in all it was a pretty good deal
neutral	their service was the difference , now orders fe delayed ( vegas bs new_jersey ) which delays my shipment week and no one suggests an_alternative .
neutral	or ships a small bag of food to tide you over ?
neutral	rip old buddy
neutral	i bought two items through groupon vouchers .
neutral	i had to order them individually incurring two postage payments .
neutral	this came after a lot of trial and error going through the website .
neutral	not very user_friendly .
neutral	the postage was as dear as the hayfever tablets , not really a bargain .
neutral	i still have not received my order .
neutral	promissed 0 bussiness days - took 0_weeks
neutral	dalevery more less ,.....
neutral	my payment was excepted on may 0 ..
neutral	it '_s now may 00 and i still_haven_'_t received parts ..
neutral	i know i used ground_shipping but i think parts should be here by now ..
neutral	n general i will say that the flight was ok but if you need some information or to if something is not clear your company ask for payment .
neutral	yur telephone service is extreamly expensive and cannot do nothing more than telling you if what you want is possible or not but they cannot help you to do it , or it cost a lot .
neutral	you don_'_t have an e_-_mail address to which the clients can send their questions or request .
neutral	that is very poor .
neutral	i can see that you want to sell tickets but not to give the normal service that a client deservs .
neutral	still your company is selling service .
neutral	if part of an order is being shipped from the manufacturer and it has_been delayed and the other items shipped and were received promptly i think the it would be a good procedure to tell the customer what the status of that remanding order is and when it will arrive .
neutral	i placed a recent order and that very thing happened to me and i had to go through the service department to clarification of the status of my order .
neutral	that takes time and plus i had doubt that my order was even totally received by 0wd even_though i was charged for those items .
neutral	the more info a customer knows about his / her order the more comfortable they are with the company they are dealing_with .
neutral	thank_you .
neutral	i will show you i am good job and action stronger wise it
neutral	i am a bit reserve in giving you a hire rate just because we have collaborate 0 time .
neutral	a more real and fair rate i would give after several trips via bravo ( if you will have the best deals on the market ).
neutral	i am waiting you to send me e_-_mail communication with bravo best deals ( i am more focused on the buch - warsaw line ).
neutral	all the best
neutral	everything it '_s ok except the carton that contains my order . when i take my order the carton was open in any corner . i think they must stop using those cartons , the quality is very poor .
neutral	the rate through travelocity was about 00_% cheaper_than their regular rate .
neutral	the social hour with free wine and bar chum was a nice_touch , and the breakfast was better_than most places .
neutral	everything in the room squeaked , exhaust fan , doors , etc .
neutral	i reported this upon checkout and the manager was very appreciative - blamed housekeeping .
neutral	i would not_hesitate to stay again .
neutral	had funeral type ribbons in bouquet , was birthday
neutral	i got a new iphone from squaretrade recently and the people with whom i spoke about my claim were great .
neutral	the shipping was fast , and the included directions were clear and easy to follow .
neutral	my main issue is that the replacement phone that i got is of really poor quality .
neutral	it has noticeable differences ( missing engraved text on the back , rippling on the screen due to finger pressure , rattling buttons ).
neutral	furthermore , within a few_days of using the replacement , the camera was already full of dust .
neutral	all of my pictures are more blurry than my those taken by my old phone .
neutral	it caught dust in the camera in one week than did my old phone did in one year .
neutral	i will be calling for another replacement .
neutral	i don_'_t see the point of limiting purchases for new customers , if i wish to spend 000_dollars in one sitting , isn_'_t that beneficial for you ?
neutral	i was disappointed to find that a recent update introduced adverts to what had been a free program .
neutral	i ad to pay to remove these adverts .
neutral	it also introduced a problem with microsoft frontpage ( rather old , i know ), where the generated thumbnails were displayed far too small .
neutral	however , the support_team provided a work - round after some discussion .
neutral	do try it and see how it works for you .
neutral	i wanted to speak to a customer service rep to ask a couple questions about the parts i was ordering so i tried their email support_ticket form and asked my questions .
neutral	i received a response that simply instructed me to call their phone line .
neutral	so i did , three_times at three different hours of the day .
neutral	each time , i was holding for the next available rep and after 00_minutes of holding i was told to try again later and the call was terminated .
neutral	good news is i still ordered the parts , they were the correct parts ( you just really have to pay_attention to what model is compatible when you add the item ( s ) to your cart ), and they were significantly_cheaper_than buying at napa or autozone .
neutral	shipping was fast too .
neutral	i got my parts 0 days after ordering and they went from ca to mi .
neutral	i find the quidco site very useful to find offers and save_money .
neutral	however it has not been without its problems .
neutral	i have had trouble comparing car insurance on the site and even finding out how to do this in the first place is difficult .
neutral	the site front page tries to do too much instead of having simpler headings such as , do you want to buy a product , do want to buy a service and do you want to compare products or services .
neutral	it would help if it could compare prices such as money super market dose .
neutral	i have had better deals on quidco compared with money super market but the design of the site has not made this an easy task .
neutral	i ordered the shimano di0 groupo , which was being offered at a very good price .
neutral	however , the charging plug was european and not north american .
neutral	i emailed customer service who first told me that because they were a european distributor they did not carry anything specific to north_america .
neutral	when i pointed_out that it would have been hard for me to order from them if they did not distribute to the usa , i was told sorry , go buy an adapter .
neutral	if merlin is going to sell to the us , they should sell products appropriate for the u . s . market or , at_least , indicate that they will not supply products that are specific to north_america .
neutral	i was disappointed that there was no map on the website .
neutral	actually farther away from the terminal than i imagined .
neutral	habe extrem viel bei amazon bestellt .
neutral	früher waren die regeln klar : preis , wie angezeigt , versand ab 00 eur gratis , fast alles ist in 0 tagen da .
neutral	mit_der einführung von marketplace wurde alles nur komplizierter :
neutral	verwirrende preise , da einiges auch gebraucht angeboten wird ; versand nur dann ab 00 eur , wenn alle gekauften produkte von amazon versandt werden .
neutral	das_ist_nicht_immer so einfach_zu durchblicken .
neutral	und : oft steht jetzt nur noch da , wann das produkt versandt wird .
neutral	wenn_man dann nach 0 tagen noch mal nachschaut , stellt sich heraus , dass es von uk oder sonstwo versandt wurde .
neutral	fazit : immer_noch alles_sehr günstig , aber augen auf , sonst ist_es enttäuschend .
neutral	they are true to their word , once the order is place there are absolutely no changes , period !
neutral	they would not even let_me add another $_000 . 00 in parts to the order even_though i asked 00_minutes after the order was placed .
neutral	i did ask to make the changes by completing a ticket request but i did not receive a response until after i received a notice the original order was shipped .
neutral	that ’_s ok ; i placed the order with rockauto after the decline .
neutral	like i said in the header , great prices and fast shipping but beware , absolutely no changes ( add or deletes ) or cancellations once you hit the submit order tab !
neutral	what company declines added sales 00_minutes after an order was place ?
neutral	and why wait for 0 days to respond to a ticket ?
neutral	it makes the ticket request useless .
neutral	but again , great prices and fast shipping on the selection they have .
neutral	actually left the page to order from amazon .
neutral	your sale price made me stick it out .
neutral	took 0 days to get gift_card .
neutral	the driver_side_mirror for a 0000_mazda protege fit like a glove , but when adjusting the mirror it did not go all the way up .
neutral	it turned from left to right and all the way down with no_issues , but turning the mirror all the way up it just wouldn_'_t go .
neutral	always been happy with myprotein '_s service and products .
neutral	however , on my last order i was sent " mega green_tea " instead of " mega cissus ".
neutral	not the end of the world i grant you , however considering i '_ve been a regular customer for many_years i was not particularly pleased with the service i received to rectify the situation .
neutral	i could either keep the green_tea ( worth £_00 less_than the cissus ) and get 00_% of my next order
neutral	or return the green_tea and get the cissus sent when my protein receive the green_tea .
neutral	again not ideal ; without trying to sound too arrogant , time is money , i '_m very busy and don_'_t want to be going to the post_office to buy a jiffy envelope , printing out my free_postage sticker etc .
neutral	it wasn_'_t my error , yet i have to make the effort to rectify everything .
neutral	just send me a new cissus !
neutral	you '_ve made thousands off me over the years .
neutral	yes i '_m making a fuss over nothing , however ; as a loyal_customer who needs his supplements asap ( like every meathead worth his weight ) i expected better service .
neutral	a good company , with excellent products but with a universal returns_policy that doesn_'_t suit everyone .
neutral	all communication through autoeurope was clear and timely .
neutral	however we were advised by autoeurope and europecar that we would have a one way hire fee of approx 000_euro , we have been charged approx 000_euro
neutral	the parking instructions for this location needs significant improvements .
neutral	the parking location is poorly market and the complex provides parking for the hotel and other businesses in the same building .
neutral	when we finally figured_out what complex was the right location , there was no_indication what entrance was for the hotel and what entrance was for the other businesses .
neutral	we guessed wrong , so when we got into the hotel and told them where we parked , they said we had to move the car to the other entrance .
neutral	if we were running close on our flight times this could have been a serious problem .
neutral	i placed an order with black leaf and received no email_confirmation that my order had been placed , or that it had been despatched .
neutral	it was a sizeable order with and i was actually in a hurry for a couple of the things so it would have been nice to hear from them .
neutral	just made the reservation .
neutral	haven_'_t used the facility yet .
neutral	i would suggest that the taxes and fees be made known upfront since they are significant .
neutral	easy to find the product you want , but having to send my personal data ( photo '_s of id ) twice , once in april and now again , after being told that my account was safe ... not very fun .
neutral	i needed a key for a friends birthday_gift and am still_waiting for my email to be answered .
neutral	time is passing , and i am getting mad .
neutral	the place louis riel suite hotel is a great hotel in downtown winnipeg .
neutral	the rooms have plenty of floor space and the room '_s interior is far above_average .
neutral	the full kitchen makes it convenient for eating in and the keurig coffee_maker is a nice_touch .
neutral	the only_complaint that i have is the gate locations for my flight ( which is partly my fault becuase i chose flights with layovers in denver and o ' hare ).
neutral	i was 00 gates away in denver and had 00_minutes to get there .
neutral	not fun .
neutral	this service worked_fine and was an improvement on last time i used meet and greet at_luton as you now meet the service in a separate area to the normal drop_off .
neutral	not as well_organized as similar service at_heathrow and the collection process was fine although it felt a bit chaotic as we have 0 small kids and there were cars and people everywhere .
neutral	would use this again if traveling from luton .
neutral	i love this website and the prices are great , everyone i have spoken to when i have called has_been really helpful .
neutral	the only_thing i wasn_'_t happy about was the way my order was packed .
neutral	you would expect that when you spend £_000 on products that they would be packed securely .
neutral	they just were left in an over sized box to rattle around in there , everything works_fine , but when you open up a box and see just the products in there moving freely with not even a bit of bubble_wrap or brown_paper to stop it moving around in the box .
neutral	i have ordered a wii_u from here and am unsure on how that might be sent to me .
neutral	it fit in the vehicle as prescribed but the reverse light receptacle did not fit snug in the hole .
neutral	the product came in on time , but the only mode of delivery was ground , why ?
neutral	over all i will use parts_geek again and will recommend friends and family to this company , also .
neutral	you could offer free shipping for returning customers , maybe ill start looking for a new place to order parts from .
neutral	the product is fine , good price and quality , but what really lets them down is thier poor customer service .
neutral	my last 0 orders have taken days to come ( one didn_'_t then they re - sent another ).
neutral	i queried this and no one replied to me .
neutral	my last order took 0 days , i am a professional sportsman , i need protien to keep my traing on track , i cannot use them anymore as they are unreliable .
neutral	you need to make your website more intuitive .
neutral	i received an_email after my review and claimed i could edit my review .
neutral	i logged in using the temporary password and email address .
neutral	where can you edit a recent review ?
neutral	and where can you change your password once you log in with a temp ?
neutral	shower_doctor is competitive in price and good service .
neutral	however the carrier they used let us down , we were phoned to arrange delivery , but the carrier did not turn up when arranged .
neutral	we arranged to take a day off work and lost a days pay for nothing .
neutral	this was my first time ordering from this company because they were very reasonably_priced .
neutral	i needed 00x00 filters and they had a good deal on a six pack .
neutral	they seemed well_packed in the box they were shipped in , but when i took them out , things changed .
neutral	first , instead of them being a package of six , they were six individual unwrapped filters .
neutral	second , they were all bent out of shape and i had to spend time getting the one i used into usable shape .
neutral	the rest i put away and will fix them as i need them .
neutral	seems to me their shipping department does not have a care in the world and just stuffed them into a box ?
neutral	needless to say , there are plenty of online companies that sell filters and i will not be ordering from them again .
neutral	the prices are great but i had a little trouble with the shipment i ordered a fuel_pump and strainer that were to be shipped together and come to find out their was an error and they shipped on two different days without me receiving notice of this information but i did get my parts and installed them and my vehicle is running again
neutral	unfortunately our recent order was split ; one package arrived at our house just fine via_ups , the other has not been delivered according to tracking notes due to use of the usps ... which only delivers to po_boxes in our area .
neutral	it was specifically noted by partsgeek that the would not ship to po_boxes , so we felt_confident in providing our home address for non_- usps shipping .
neutral	what now ?
neutral	todd mckinney
neutral	000 - 000 - 0000 cell
neutral	tmckinney0 @ san . rr . com
neutral	the seller has to be better in describing what the selling and have an exact picture so there is no conflict with ebays .
neutral	compatibilaty chart
neutral	the translation i ordered was from thai to english .
neutral	i made sure to indicate that spacing and formatting were important .
neutral	this request was respected .
neutral	however , there were several errors in the translation of the text .
neutral	specifically , the identities of " mr ." v . " mrs ." and " son " v .
neutral	" daughter ."
neutral	these were key part of the text that needed to be properly identified .
neutral	i will need to make corrections , although i am still unsure if rev . com offers a guarantee on their work or will they charge me extra to make these edits .
neutral	the item that i purchased , outside mirror , appeared white in the picture .
neutral	in the write up , the color was not mentioned .
neutral	i assumed , silly me , that what i saw is what i would get .
neutral	the item that arrived was black , and i needed white .
neutral	the good news is that i was able to reuse the cover from my old mirror , so i did not have to go through the hassle of sending it back and exchanging .
neutral	delivery was good and efficient .
neutral	like i said , close but not cigar .
neutral	i made a reservation using meet and greet - a month laterlater changed my vehicle .
neutral	i contacted meet and greet to advise them of my new vehicle details , which they confirmed and emailed me the updated documentation .
neutral	later when i arrived at the airport the chauffer was no where to be seen .
neutral	i contacted meet and greet repeatedly but no - one answered .
neutral	when someone did answer they kept telling_me the chauffer had arrived .
neutral	after 00_minutes of speaking to random chauffeurs from other_companies and and trying to contact meet and greet the chauffeur did arrive and released he was looking for the wrong car , their systems had not updated ?!
neutral	lucky i was there an_hour early otherwise we could of missed our flight .
neutral	this may have been a one - off mistake but first_impressions count .
neutral	having said this , the return of my vehicle was acceptable and on time , and the staff were friendly and polite .
neutral	bien la frecuencia y estado de_las unidades .
neutral	pero por momentos deficiente la calidad del sonido de_la audio guía .
neutral	mucha interferencia , que dificultaba
neutral	no problem with whisky_exchange themselves .
neutral	my issues arose when i missed a parcel_force delivery .
neutral	forced to collect from central town post_office several miles_away rather_than local post_office .
neutral	was told it would be there next_day .
neutral	after travelling into town and paying for parking i found it wasn_'_t there .... had to return again next_day , paying for parking again and wasting more time .
neutral	change courier and i ' d use whisky_exchange again , otherwise i wouldn_'_t , just not worth the hassle .
neutral	the key i received from them is working .
neutral	the anti_- fraud_check thing is bullshit , such a terrible system .
neutral	i requested a pin to be sent for my phone_number twice and didn_'_t receive anything yet the system still claimed that i have successfully received the pin , that '_s not correct however .
neutral	and there is no live support , how is this a successful company without live support - _ - ?
neutral	then i had to wait a full night to receive a reply to get my key .
neutral	i wouldn_'_t buy anything_else off this website though , prices aren_'_t that attractive anyhow .
neutral	i '_ll stick to [_external reference_], more efficient , no fraud bs !
neutral	the delivery was great , best price etc etc
neutral	but
neutral	i bought a sram apex white groupset , when i received it the brake levers were not the white ones that should come as part of the groupset .
neutral	i went on line to check and noticed that in the small_print it said that the ' white groupset came with the black brakes and not the white ones as pictured '.
neutral	a little annoying but by this time i ' d fitted the other components to the bike .
neutral	yes i know i could replace the hoods for white ones but this wasn_'_t the point .
neutral	to be fair i didn_'_t bother to contact merlin to see if there was anything that could be done .
neutral	i have been trying to find a foglight for my mb for a while .
neutral	ordered a lens from you which was the wrong model .
neutral	tried to contact cust service many_times and only after a facebook post did someone contact me .
neutral	i was told my car was an early model that '_s why i got the wrong part .
neutral	i was also told with the oem number you could get the correct part .
neutral	i emailed the oem number and never_heard back .
neutral	after two more emails i finally got an answer asking for my phone_number to discuss the part .
neutral	i sent it but have never_heard back and no phone_call .
neutral	since then with the oem number i found my fog_light at another parts warehouse .
neutral	partsgeek had good products and fast order processed and shipping but if you need help or customer service go somewhere_else .
neutral	fares cheaper_than i have found elsewhere , but many itineraries include overnight stays which mean u have to stay in airport , hotel and also pick_up bags and recheck .
neutral	so if this is ok then yes you can save_money .
neutral	very good products but when you have ran_out of a size you never seem to replenish .
neutral	iv been waiting for vest in large for months now .
neutral	you claim orders are immediately processed , so i order on sundays .
neutral	yet it takes until wednesday before they ship !
neutral	i say that is far from immediate !
neutral	i always like the hotel per_night room rate i receive through your company .
neutral	the misleading part .....
neutral	thinking i am dealing_with the actual hotel and i '_m dealing_with a company like you online .
neutral	your rules and regulations are different than hotel ???
neutral	i have to make a point to see who i am dealing_with .... and also be able to use points
neutral	we had leaned on partsgeek to get a hard to find part .
neutral	after_placing the order , the order was cancelled due to availability .
neutral	i bet the part is still listed as in stock .
neutral	would have been better if they would go the extra_mile to cross the part into another brand or try to outsource .
neutral	i ordered a license_plate frame .
neutral	it did not come with the installation hardware and they could not supply it .
neutral	it does not say in the description that it includes the hardware but most parts like this do .
neutral	this site is great in many ways , except for oversea trips .
neutral	they booked me in this decent hotel , but i could not speak a single word .
neutral	kudos to the hotel , but language_barrier .
neutral	cheap products but the customer service is very poor !
neutral	if they run out of a product and are unable to send one to you , they do not inform you of this until after the product was due to be delivered and the staff are not very helpful and can come_across slightly rude .
neutral	this is obviously frustrating .
neutral	apart_from the dispatch problems and customer service issues , it is generally ok !
neutral	just have to hope they haven_'_t run out of the product you are after .
neutral	the registration lady was nice , but had no intimate knowledge of the hotel itself .
neutral	i had asked questions that she could not answer , such as , " the room i had last_year was room #_00000 .
neutral	is the room i '_m booking now on that floor ?
neutral	can i have that particular room ?"
neutral	she could not guaranty that room nor tell me the location of what room i would be in in relation to the above mentioned room .
neutral	my last stay i had booked thru an agency and upgraded my room upon_arrival , the room i got was an amazing corner suit and i wanted to be at_least on the same floor or above .
neutral	the web_site has 0 different rush tower gold suites and i was not sure i was getting the same caliber of room as last time for the price i was paying .
neutral	page freezes up often .
neutral	need to be able to purchase larger values $$$$$$ with a greater limit ,. online help on the other end was of no help but best i could find for being in canada . it is worth a check for prepaid_cards online i used many_times
neutral	our experience with autoeurope went fairly smoothly .
neutral	my initial_contact was by phone with a customer service rep who was extremely_helpful .
neutral	with his assistance i was able to determine the best locations for pick - up and drop - off of the vehicle .
neutral	it was in this second step , at the pick - up location , that the process became somewhat frustrating .
neutral	the termini in rome is not well marked for guidance to the rental_car agencies .
neutral	once we finally found the agencies , we stood in a very long line at autoeurope only to discover our rental_car was not actually from autoeurope , but europcar .
neutral	autoeurope was only the booking agent .
neutral	so , we had move to and stand in europcar '_s long line .
neutral	in total it took 0 0 / 0 hours to pick - up our car .
neutral	too_long !
neutral	however , i should add , though i had not scheduled a gps , the clerk at the europcar counter responded to my last_minute request with patience and determination , so that we did acquire a gps , without which we would have been doomed .
neutral	most_importantly the car ran well during our rental and provided excellent diesel mileage ; however , when the gps ( a tomtom ) got hot , it wouldn_'_t operate , so we learned not to leave it in the car ( glovebox ).
neutral	before we determined why the tomtom wasn_'_t working - before it cooled in the air_conditioning and began to work again - i tried several_times to call the 000 customer service number .
neutral	on the first call i was put on hold ; after about 0 minutes i was disconnected , so i tried again and sat on hold for about 00_minutes before i gave up .
neutral	i don_'_t know what we would have done if the tomtom hadn_'_t started working again .
neutral	finally , the drop - off was a complete mess , for europcar has no signs directing customers what to do , so we all stood in line waiting behind customers picking - up , only to discover we were to go outside , find a europcar rep and turn our keys and gps into him .
neutral	this proved to be a challenge , for their employees were not in any kind of a uniform .
neutral	furthermore , there were no forms to sign , so any one of us who were returning cars could have easily handed_over keys and gps to a theif on the street .
neutral	i arrived earlier_than stated on the booking and when i called to tell them i was 0 min from the terminal they advised i had to wait for another hour as there was nobody available .
neutral	it ended_up taking slightly less_than 0 hour but i had to stop somewhere to kill some time .
neutral	i was told it was my " fault " .
neutral	overall experience wasn_'_t terrible but not the best either .
neutral	this happened on a week day during non peak time .
neutral	i wish i had bought 0 of each light because now the lights that still looked good don_'_t look so hot and i don_'_t want to have to pay again for shipping .
neutral	speaking of shipping the 0 parts i received came in a box 0 times bigger then it had to be , maybe that is why the shipping was so much .
neutral	i had to fill_out same crazy stuff to try and get a rebate on the shipping which if it comes as a future credit on a shipping order i will not be happy .
neutral	my fiance and i recently took a norwegian cruise to nowhere departing from nyc aboard the breakaway .
neutral	the cruise was listed as on travelocity for , what appeared to be , a very affordable price .
neutral	unfortunately , there were fees that did not appear until check out that effectively doubled the expense .
neutral	however , i figured that ncl would be similar to the other cruises i have taken ( holland america and carnival ) and wrongly assumed i would spend very little while on the ship ( especially since there were no excursions ).
neutral	i could not have been more mistaken .
neutral	on all the previous cruises i have taken , almost every meal was included and each restaurant was unique .
neutral	in addition , previous cruises offered discounts on wine , beer and sodas .
neutral	in some instances wine and beer were also included in certain_areas of the ships .
neutral	you were not afforded a choice but at_least one beer and one white and red wine choice was included .
neutral	on previous cruises , one dinner was always truly gourmet , including lobster or crab and a fine steak .
neutral	the cabin stewards worked hard to ensure your room was comfortable , in - room entertainment like movies were provided free of charge and met your expectations for cleanliness .
neutral	lastly , all room service was available 00hrs a day .
neutral	aboard the norwegian breakaway , very little of these accommodations were evident .
neutral	restaurants were plentiful , but only a handful were included .
neutral	furthermore , those which were included had sub - par cuisine , identical to that which was available in the buffet and thus identical to each other .
neutral	( i suspect that plates were brought down to the restaurants from the buffet .)
neutral	the service in these restaurants was akin to local jersey diner .
neutral	there were no included wines or beers or even sodas for that matter .
neutral	( on other cruise lines you can purchase drink cards ' buy 00 get 0 free or unlimited sodas ) drinks at the numerous bars on - board were well mixed and delightful , but very expensive .
neutral	i regularly bar - hop in nyc and found the prices to be about equal .
neutral	essentially , it appears that ncl developed and provided these cruises to be absolute moneymakers .
neutral	they charge extra for everything , including bar games like billiards and darts .
neutral	the staff were constantly looking for tips even_though a 00_% gratuity was added to every on - board purchase .
neutral	even in - room movies were extra ( not new_releases ) and expensive .
neutral	i rented one for $_00 that redbox has for $. 00 .
neutral	even the duty free shops were more than what is typically charged .
neutral	the only truly positive thing i can say about the breakaway cruise was the entertainment .
neutral	it was exceptional !!!!
neutral	the shows were broadway quality and the live music in the jazz room was not to be believed .
neutral	even the comedy club was highly entertaining .
neutral	this was the only real redeeming factor and the only reason this cruise gets 0_stars from me .
neutral	if the entertainment was as lackluster as everything else on - board this would have gotten 0_star .
neutral	next time , i believe i will spend a few_hundred_dollars more upfront to fly to and stay at an all - inclusive hotel and end up saving a few_hundred_dollars overall .
neutral	i understand i '_m not the only customer , but the response times are horrible , whether emailing them through their contact form , which you can only have one ticket open at a time , so unless they close it , you can '_t open a new ticket .
neutral	also trying to call them is almost non_- existent .
neutral	i got lucky a couple times .
neutral	the " acceptable experience " part is the item i purchase what a great piece , fit my car and has performed well , since the install .
neutral	to sum_up , it wasn_'_t an overall nightmare , but enough to get me thinking about if i want to purchase again .
neutral	got my renewal documents , but found a chepaer quote on price compare site with same company .
neutral	rang up to cancel renewal and told them about new deal so the called me back in a few_minutes to offer a small discount .
neutral	found out a few_days_later they ' d taken money out for the renewal and the new policy and that a refund would take a few_days ( 0 - 00 ) to sort ??
neutral	not exactly thrilled at the prospect of being out of pocket a few hundered quid as you can imagine .
neutral	i bought a pot of mask sealant but it didn_'_t come in the branded pot as_advertised , it could be silicon grease for all l know .
neutral	i am yet to try it though so will reserve judgement until then , however l like to get what l pay for packaging and all .
neutral	i bought a 00 oz .
neutral	silver bar .
neutral	i had hoped it wouldn_'_t be scratched or dulled on the obverse ................. but it was .
neutral	i bought a brand_new vocal screen , which appears the last available , only to recieve in excellent time , but obviously flawed .
neutral	tell tale signs of use , and one bent componant marred what otherwise would have been an excellent experience .
neutral	coupled_with the lack of response from cs when emailed , they probably_won_'_t see my money again .
neutral	shame .
neutral	this is all !
neutral	!
neutral	man it took a while , i thought i had been scammed on the internet yet again , but no !!!!
neutral	the confirmation_email came through ( a month after the process was started ) and boom we was back in business , could of done with a bit more communication to let_me know the status of my order and a bit more onus took onboard by the company that took the money , very slippery shoulders me thinks , but all in all i paid my money and got what i wanted so yeah eventually was satisfied .
neutral	delivery was swift .
neutral	item itself is good quality but we ordered a blue trampoline and a pink one was delivered !!
neutral	luckily it is for use by two grandchildren , one boy and one girl , so we have kept item rather_than go through hassle of returning etc .
neutral	hence only 0 *.
neutral	ordered on feb 0 , have not received the item yet , march 0
neutral	i ordered a eastern_catalytic catalytic_converter for a subaru baja
neutral	part number : 00000 -_00000000
neutral	the part arrived in 0 days just in time for the weekend project .
neutral	note_: this is a complicated part with flanges at wired angles and a bend in the middle .
neutral	the quality of the part is fair , they could of easily added mounting_holes for the original subaru heat shields .
neutral	but the main issue i had was that the combinations of one flange was welded on just a little off and so was one of the bends in the pipe between the two converters , which made it impossible to install as it angled up into the bottom of the car , so i took it to a muffler shop and had them add a 0 degree bend in to make it align properly .
neutral	so i had to add an extra 00 dollars to cost but i can still almost buy 0 of them for the price of one original subaru part .
neutral	customer service not helpful at all will not be using this company again they will not admit they are at fault
neutral	you can get some great old_movies at a super price .
neutral	the shipping at times is high .
neutral	i paid more for shipping than the cost of the movie last time .
neutral	it was a double feature and absolutely awful .
neutral	do some research on the movie you ' re buying first .
neutral	everything was good .
neutral	shipping was on time .
neutral	although it did take over a week .
neutral	it was the right part .
neutral	looked clean and in good condition .
neutral	however , there was a seal missing .
neutral	unfortunately i didn_'_t notice until after completing the install .
neutral	the seal on the spline shaft that joins to the steering column shaft was missing .
neutral	this meant i needed to completely uninstall the rack and pinion to put the old seal from my original unit on .
neutral	then reinstall the unit .
neutral	i essentially had to do the install twice .
neutral	you could say i should have checked more carefully .
neutral	however , shouldn_'_t they have checked more carefully , this is what they do .
neutral	i paid for a re - manufactured unit not a partially re - manufactured unit .
neutral	all considered it seems to be a good product .
neutral	in the end time will tell .
neutral	we haven_'_t used the service enough to completely judge it , but so_far we have had a mix of problems calling vietnam .
neutral	first there seems to be problems on the line , then there was an important call that we couldn_'_t get through , so we had to resort to direct dialing .
neutral	tel0 did email that they noticed a problem and had written a trouble ticket on it , giving us a few free minutes .
neutral	i n attempts to call several numbers in vietnam a day later , with one call going through , but another was problematic .
neutral	not sure if it was the party on the other end or the service .
neutral	basically so_far , the service isn_'_t as good as we enjoyed with another company that is now out of business .
neutral	update_: made two calls which went through , however quality of connection was still not too good due to static on line .
neutral	problem probably with carrier .
neutral	did report to tel0 via trouble ticket .
neutral	good prices but hate companys like my protein n people who cant through a scoop at 00p or so into a order over 00 pound ,,,, got all my dosages wrong 0st few_days ,, even worded in big writing to say by the way u don_'_t get a scoop ,,,
neutral	i '_ve had dealings with them on numerous_occasions .
neutral	most of the time there service is fine good communication and quick dispatch times .
neutral	however problems do occur .
neutral	i made an order on their website ( on a side_note the website is not the best to navigate and time_consuming having to search through manufacturer instead of product ) because it was showing in stock , they took payment and emailed me to tell me it had been dispatched , all standard and what i expected .
neutral	they then emailed me to say they didn_'_t have the item in stock .
neutral	strange i thought as you '_ve already emailed me to tell me you '_ve dispatched it .
neutral	in my eyes a clear sign something there is not working_properly .
neutral	no problem i thought , i was promptly informed they should have it back in stock and dispatched to me within 0 - 00 days as they get 0 deliveries a week .
neutral	0_weeks and 0 deliveries later still nothing and the only communication i got was when i contacted them first .
neutral	i eventually cancelled my order and changed it to something else .
neutral	there only explanation was a problem with the supplier .
neutral	i '_m sorry hh that may be the reason you didn_'_t get them in stock but not an excuse for taking payment for something you didn_'_t have and being unaware of your own stock_levels .
neutral	i have sort of a mixed review of partsgeek , on one hand the part i ordered arrived undamaged and on time but unfortunately was the wrong part for my truck .
neutral	i share some of the responsibilty for the misorder but the part should have never been linked to my vehicle because it did not fit my engine , truck or any other related model .
neutral	now i have to return the part pay shipping , restocking_fees and the original overpriced shipping bill which costs as much as the part itself .
neutral	going down_hill fast to many ads to much clutter .
neutral	make_sure that when people hire a gps that it actually works .
neutral	we had one that was low battery and couldn_'_t charge it up .
neutral	very disappointed .
neutral	i found the online experience with arguscarhire extremely easy to follow and was pleased with the choices of car available and the price .
neutral	pity i cant say the same of the car_hire firm they used in portugal .
neutral	international car_hire gave_us a real run around .
neutral	they stopped our credit_card to guarantee any money if we had an accident , when we showed the woman at the desk that we already had cdw_insurance she told us that it wasnt worth the paper it was written on as it hadnt been purchased through international car_hire .
neutral	however if we were to telephone and immediately cancel our cdw_insurance she would sell us international '_s own cdw_insurance at 00 euros cash not credit_card and she could then miraculously get our credit_card unblocked .
neutral	this was after two_days of trying to telephone her office and we eventually had to drive all the way back to the airport to speak to them .
neutral	after returning back to scotland we received a call asking us where we had left the car as they couldnt find it even_though it was parked a maximum of 00metres away from her office as requested .
neutral	it took three_weeks for them to unblock the card and return our money .
neutral	the car itself had several scrapes on it prior to our receiving it and the engine seemed very unresponsive for the whole holiday .
neutral	thanks international car_hire for meaning our holiday became an exercise in spend thrift would not recommend them .,
neutral	had 0 arrowspeed fitted at home recently .
neutral	the tyre_fitter went out of his way to maje sure we were happy .
neutral	only_gripe is after ordering online sat_morning and bookung a monday fitting slot , appointment was re arranged twice as kwik_fit central told us one of the 0 had been sold over the weekend .
neutral	may have been a lune as i could only find 0 when ringing_round local depots on the friday .
neutral	beware online promises !
neutral	its good to talk ..
neutral	i odered product from this company and paid for a specific delivery date , i received no product and no one from a0skateboards has neithered answered any calls nor returned any calls .
neutral	this company has already shown poor business savy and i recommend that if you don_'_t want to lose sleep at night , don_'_t order from them .
neutral	in all fairness , i placed the original above complaint earlier today 00 / 0 / 0000 .
neutral	i have just received my package from a0skateboards . com on 00 / 0 / 0000 .
neutral	i ordered the package on the 00 / 00 / 0000 with an_additional payment for 0 day rush order ; you do the math and of course it didn_'_t arrive on time .
neutral	a0skateboards could have communicated with me and maybe they would have acquired a better customer relationship with me .
neutral	in light of all the drama , a0skateboards . com still helped_me put a smile on my son '_s face , which in the proverbial master card phrase " priceless ".
neutral	i still am disapointed with the professionalism of a0skateboards . com , but your money is safe with them .
neutral	they deserve two stars but i '_m giving them three due to the smile on my son '_s face .
neutral	if a0skateboards . com are reviewing this comment work on your professionalism in customer_support and you get my vote .
neutral	aka : disgruntal purchser
neutral	dpd and dale express were good courier .
neutral	parcelforce was not great .
neutral	they should have try to call me when they deliver the item on that day .
neutral	as for my dining_table and chairs , i still yet to receive them and the expected delivery date is more than 0 month after i placed my order .
neutral	a buck for the first month is a good deal , but its really 00 bucks with " administrative fees " the access hoursare listed as 0am - 0pm which isn_'_t great , but .
neutral	... the access gate is never locked , so its not a very secure or well_lit facility .
neutral	for me it is really bad that you charge 0 . 00cents for a emei id , and at the end you do not provide your services to portugal .
neutral	i have sent 0 . 00 cent to garbage .
neutral	good website with a good aray of products .
neutral	i have ordered from them many_times with problems here and there along the way .
neutral	this is the third time on a trot that i have been_disappointed with product i '_ve purchased .
neutral	every order only half the ink_cartridges have worked and i '_ve had ink everywhere where one , two or in one case three of them have leaked .
neutral	i might just as well of paid full price for the genuine item because that '_s what it ends up costing me with what doesn_'_t work and leakages i throw_away .
neutral	the format to obtain a printed map assumes that the enquirer is computer_literate and given that i am miles from that , the system appears over elaborate to me and if a more simple straightforward and idiot - proofed could be introduced , i for one would be appreciative .
neutral	e . g .
neutral	address of property ?
neutral	scale required ?

neutral	who want be in trust in all booking in hotels in any country by net must be booking from easytobook with full trust .
neutral	one time i did mistake with booking in hotel i did 00 nights even i want only one night in 0 mints i was called one who working with easytobook and answering me quickly and finished my problem in mint so i love this site and i will do always inshallah my booking from this site ... for all my friends its super site easytobook and very kindly all the teams who working with .. see you soon
neutral	i sent an_email to you on may 0th , today is may_00th and i never received a reply .
neutral	i would cancel my order if it wasn_'_t too_late since i found the green bean coffee extractt at walmart for $ 0 . 00 less .
neutral	they taped the bubble tape to the actual chrome itself , leaving this big tape mark all over my new parts , and now on my car .
neutral	made an_appointment for new tires .
neutral	tires had to be ordered & they were short 0 tire .
neutral	had to leave car overnight because i could not afford to take more time out of work to pick it up & drop it off again
neutral	received four bushings for a rear upper wishbone control_arm .
neutral	the bushings fit the knuckles .
neutral	i '_ve ordered at_least 0 times from partsgeek .
neutral	now that i need to return some parts i find it a little annoying that i can '_t reach a live operator to explain the part i need .
neutral	partsgeek seems more interested in verifying the parts than getting me the parts i need .
neutral	the purpose of cutomer service .
neutral	they did keep me informed and got me what i wanted .
neutral	what i recieved in the end was
neutral	money into my account .
neutral	but there wasnt any paperwork to explain the money and how much was taken as commission .
neutral	otherwise i cant_complain .
neutral	hundreds of pound better off and to be honest i couldnt be bothered doing it myself .
neutral	i ordered a patch for my fw tank .
neutral	it is 0x0 inches , about 0 / 0 inch thick and weighs a couple of ounces .
neutral	the cost of the patch was reasonable .
neutral	however the cost to ship was $ 0 . 00 .
neutral	could have put it in an envelope and shipped for a dollar or two .
neutral	since i couldn_'_t find it locally , i paid the ransom .
neutral	i hate doing_business with vendors that overcharge for shipping and handling and avoid it whenever i can .
neutral	i would not recommend dryer '_s because of this .
neutral	dearer_than booking direct , i should have checked first , thought breakfast included at time easybookers price was offered to me but apparently not in confirmaion email
neutral	good but why is it not possible or difficult to book seats ?
neutral	ordered a piece of door trim for my bmw , then called and was reassured 0 times it was the right one , then when it arrived , guess what , wrong piece of trim .
neutral	ordered what was told again was the right piece , waiting to see how this one turns_out .
neutral	printing ink expensive but a little cheaper_than supermarket .
neutral	we '_ve been working with scunthorpe printing . com for some time and we '_ve found some really great ways of working together .
neutral	being a web & graphic_design company we '_ve found printing . com easy to work with ... until now .
neutral	in the past it '_s been easy to check prices on the go , order online and more .
neutral	now the site appears geared to the vista - print type market , a complete shift from your established ( and working ) business model .
neutral	i appreciate the site is still a work in progress , but should not be put live until working .
neutral	we '_ve found ourselves trying to order online , but being faced with a raft of issues , error messages and more , resulting in us having to finally go to the store to process orders .
neutral	we are an exceptionally busy company and just don_'_t have time to mess_around like this .
neutral	fortunately , our local store are exceptionally helpful and accommodating , which is the saving_grace to an otherwise exceptionally disappointing and frustrating experience .
neutral	bom dia !!
neutral	!
neutral	tempos atrás fiz a primeira_compra , e de acordo como recomendado o_produto chegou no prazo e a mercadoria intacta e com isso peguei confiança no site , então resolvi fazer fazer outro pedido , só que dessa vez não fui tão feliz por isso , já faz um mês que fiz o_pedido e até agora a minha_encomenda não chegou .
neutral	agora eu fico pensando , será que são atencioso só na primeira_compra ? o prazo de 0 a 00_dias úteis é só na primeira_compra ?
neutral	gostaria que vocês desse uma olhada em meu pedido pois até nessa momento eu não recebi meu pedido , o numero da ordem é #_000000000 , fico no aguardo de uma resposta com uma solução ,

neutral	not sure about catalog on line .
neutral	lower cost parts were wrong , have to perches , higher_priced part .
neutral	they are doing a call_tag on parts , but sense i got other parts they are not going to refund any of shipping cost .
neutral	however the higher price part has free shipping .
neutral	also when i called 0 times on my cell_phone , after on hold ,( that seemed like forever ) i got dumped back to a main_menu .
neutral	be for i could press # 0 key " good by thanks for calling " ______
neutral	so i called on wife '_s cell , got through right_away .
neutral	talked to donald burton .
neutral	he did a great job !
neutral	and helped_me .
neutral	my hope is that they correct the problem with there catalog on line .
neutral	it almost seemed like a ploy .
neutral	when you try to enter the security validation to verify your travel request .
neutral	the validation code is so obscured that that it takes 0 or 0 attempts for the average user to read it , and enter it properly .
neutral	if you try the ip0 voice version , it has the same problem with the voice response .
neutral	i was pleased with the ease of making the reservation , however , was amazed that it has already charged to my credit_card .
neutral	usually the charge doesn_'_t go on your card until the reservation is actually used .
neutral	what if we have to cancel our reservation ?
neutral	that part did not please me .
neutral	we aren_'_t going for over a month but will have to pay before we even go .
neutral	not real good business .
neutral	lots could happen in the next 0_weeks .
neutral	and if i have to pay before we even go and then have to cancel have the hassle of crediting my credit_card .
neutral	so , don_'_t think i '_ll use this again , will just go thru the hotel itself .
neutral	great selection , just wish i didn_'_t have to pay for shipping
neutral	i pre_- ordered me0 months_ago and last_week i get the email_saying that your order is in the post .
neutral	usually the games i have ordered from shop . to are delivered on release day sometimes if your lucky the day before .
neutral	no game yet for me .
neutral	i hope it here in the next few_days .
neutral	products ok most of the time
neutral	i thought when i ordered this that it would hav r shipped the same day but it took a couple
neutral	of days and news of delivery but no feedback .
neutral	amazon is much_better
neutral	it was nice that they had the part i needed but i wasnt happy with how long it took to get my part . but i might use them again . they had the best price i could find on line
neutral	two of the pictures we wanted that were going to grandaughters they were in their swimsuits , one is 0 the other 00 .
neutral	we at first had over 00 on order , the whole order was cancelled instead of the option of changing 0 or just cancel them and not all .
neutral	had to go back in and build the whole order .
neutral	my order was filled pretty fast , but they duplicated one order and never sent a couple of other items , when i asked them to call and sraighten it out they sent me return #, s for items i never recieved , after another e_-_mail they reimbursted my card with no_explanation ?
neutral	i like the service and use it fairly regularly so most of my uk and international shipments .
neutral	the only_thing that winds me up is the entry of addresses , firstly the facility to store my collection address does not seem to work in firefox so i have to enter it each time , this is not too bad with autofill but the character length restrictions are a painand only show when you go to move to the next page .
neutral	an extra line for longer addresses would be good .
neutral	the whole address look - up thing is also a pain and doesn_'_t have all the options so you pick one , it overwrites what you have entered so you need to re - type it - get it sorted
neutral	when i originally booked the car , it was to be a small car , suitable for one person .
neutral	when i went to pick_up the car , i was given a large , 0 - wheel_drive vehicle .
neutral	this appeared to be the only one available .
neutral	this vehicle was completely dissimilar to what i had booked and what i had needed .
neutral	when i returned the vehicle after six days , i was charged over seventy three pounds for fuel usage .
neutral	i would like to know what mileage i actually did in the vehicle .
neutral	when i picked_up the vehicle at the desk in belfast airport , i was told that fuel would cost 0 . 00 pounds per_litre , but it appears that i have been charged at 0 . 00 pounds per_litre .
neutral	as i feel that i have been overcharged for fuel , and considering i was supposed to have a much smaller vehicle which would have used much less fuel , i would appreciate you taking up this matter with driveaway_holidays / europcar .
neutral	i await your advice .
neutral	i have ordered a few_times from mankind because they do at_least normally have some good user reviews on the site .
neutral	other than that , i find their products very averagely priced ( normally always cheaper on amazon ) and the one time i had a problem with an order i found their customer service slow and very unhelpful .
neutral	all in all i would say use the site for the user reviews but buy elsewhere for more competitively_priced items and from somewhere with better customer service .
neutral	the first order i made was difficult to do .
neutral	the arrangement that went out was not what i ordered , it was not delivered to door but was left on ground by entry drive .
neutral	flowers were welted after sitting out .
neutral	i called back and was told the florist that had done the order refused to correct the problem or replace the order ,
neutral	i called back and was hung_up on .
neutral	when i called back the next time my call was handled by a very nice , professional lady , who went out of here way to help me .
neutral	the arrangement was done correctly by a different florist and delivered very quickly .
neutral	the only problem i have with avis is that the call_center tries to make you think that they are at the local_florist , not a wire service .
neutral	had i wanted a wire service i would have called ftd and saved time and headaches .
neutral	my experience was satisfactory with the exception of communication !
neutral	the description , price and shipping was good .
neutral	i had a question and was unable to get any communication !!!
neutral	i tried the email ( as was suggested ) and the phone with absolutely no response via either !!!
neutral	in fact , i emailed twice with no reply !!!!
neutral	i believe that they should check out their email system .
neutral	it definately needs improvement !!!
neutral	!
neutral	the website is in need of an update , whenever i purchase from baracuta i always seem to run_into problems with the website however this isn_'_t apparent until after my order has_been placed and i have paid .
neutral	the most_recent time i purchased an item and was sent one in a different_colour .
neutral	after countless_times of me trying to get through to the customer service i finally did and i was told that they would send out the right colour and it would be with me in a couple of days .
neutral	i waited 0 days for the item and it still hadn_'_t arrived so i called up again , i had to call approximately 0 / 0 times before i got an answer and this time i was told that what i had ordered was actually out of stock , my name and number was taken and i was promised to have a call back .
neutral	i never got a call back .
neutral	i now have an item i do not want , i am unable to send back due to misplacement of the returns_label and they are not answering emails so i can '_t get another one sent out to me via post or as an_email attachment .
neutral	i give a company 0 chances before they lose my custom , this is their second chance .
neutral	while the clothing they make are of a high_quality , exclusive and well_worth the price , the problems with the customer service and website is enough to turn anyone away .
neutral	i unfortunately will have to shop elsewhere , i don_'_t live near london so i am unable to visit the one store they have .
neutral	the tour_bus met me at the paddington station hilton lobby on time .
neutral	the guides were very helpful and courteous about collecting everyone at their respective locations .
neutral	but , what wasn_'_t conveyed was that once everyone was collected , we were taken to another area where we had to be re - organized and get on another bus that would take us on our respective tour .
neutral	i wish this was made clear when i purchased my ticket .
neutral	it took a lot of extra time ( about half an_hour ) that could have been better utilized .
neutral	the bus was lovely , and our guide was fine .
neutral	my main objective was stonehenge , but our time was very limited to about 00_minutes .
neutral	overall a it was a very rushed day .
neutral	windsor castle essentially had no access , and we basically could only walk about outside .
neutral	the hot springs at bath were very accessible .
neutral	be warned *** if you are late getting back to the bus , they will leave you behind .
neutral	these buses operate on a tight_schedule ... and they aren_'_t kidding *** cost effectiveness ... i felt it was pricey for what i got , but it was convenient and comfortable .
neutral	because of the convenience , not a poorly spent 000 bucks , but i could certainly do it more efficiently on my own .
neutral	i noticed while_driving that my new driver '_s outside rear_view_mirror vibrates .
neutral	it is only the mirror that vibrates , not the mirror mount , so the quality of the backing plate fastener to the mirror adjustment motor is the culprit , but i forgive that .
neutral	what i really like is the savings of @ $_000 i got by buying at partsgeek .
neutral	johnd
neutral	cleveland , ms
neutral	the prices are why i considered partsgeek but you need to be_careful .
neutral	they provide nice product images in a well_organized fashion but the item descriptions are short on details so its on you to make_sure its the correct part .
neutral	they is little to no customer service so don_'_t expect much help is something_goes_wrong they don_'_t even allow you to cancel an order before it is process and don_'_t expect to send anything back .
neutral	shipping take the full 00 days so plan_ahead .
neutral	the prices are unbeatable but if you are not sure if you are ordering the correct part them you may want to consider going somewhere_else .
neutral	it was not clear that whether the hotel reservation was for a number of nights or for a checkout date .
neutral	i made a reservation for one night less_than i needed .
neutral	the tech_support line was closed during normal us business hours .
neutral	the reservation was not changeable .
neutral	i got a second reservation for the last night .
neutral	i suppose this was better_than getting a non_- changeable reservation for an extra day .
neutral	but i probably will find a different site to book from .
neutral	product is good but this firm ships fedex home delivery which is the worst shipping service in the us .
neutral	fedex leaves packages in the driveway , regardless of weather and then sneaks off .
neutral	shipping was free but petbest does not tell customers how order will be shipped until after the order is complete .
neutral	after the fact , i was told that if i contact them ahead of time , they will ship ups .
neutral	they did answer emails quickly .
neutral	the ordering was good , the price was ok but they did not tell me the radiator was not in stock . a few_days_later they tell me when i am expecting it to arrive and now the job is held up so i am not to happy with the company .
neutral	shipping was fast .
neutral	ease of returns was terrible , website was down and no one answers the phones or returns phone_calls
neutral	sometimes transfers take longer_than_expected due to staff shortages not enabling upload of monies to fund transfers , normal service would allow transfers to overseas the following working day for drawing that same working day
neutral	car_rental booking i made from canada for the uk was flawless .
neutral	am now in france trying to make a booking and it won_'_t work .
neutral	have no choice but to look_elsewhere
neutral	on the plus , i love google_search , maps , calander , and docs .
neutral	i haven_'_t had a chance to use their phone service , yet .
neutral	my big gripe with them now is the advertisements , and especially their facebook wannabe google +.
neutral	navigating_through all the google + none sense has_become a real_pain when all you want is to check your e_mail .
neutral	love the services you ' re good at google .
neutral	please just stick to those !
neutral	slow service but price was good .
neutral	good and happy , but the fan i am not happy with as it makes lots of smell when it is on .
neutral	needed headlights so did not return parts .
neutral	lights give off horrible shadows .
neutral	but , they are still better then what was on vehicle .
neutral	i was a bit surprised that they invited me to review as i have not had an overly smooth_ride with this company .
neutral	i have used them for a couple of years with the usual niggles from online buying damaged cartons etc but as a drinker and not a collector i did not complain and am sure the boxes would have been replaced if asked .
neutral	they even sent me the wrong bottle once but it was to my benefit .
neutral	this year i have had two orders which came without cartons a minor_niggle but would have been nice to have been told this on the page where the item info is .
neutral	i also had the " pleasure " of have to use customer_services this year to resolve a problem , although the response was quick via_email i got the distinct impression that they get lots of emails a day by people trying to get money by complaining , my complaint was treated as such .
neutral	it was resolved in end but during correspondence it was implied in the politest way possible that i was lying which i admit did get my back up especially when my time and money was wasted .
neutral	i say that they are the diageo of whisky shop because i really hate to have to buy from them but some products you just can '_t get anywhere_else .
neutral	the parts i ordered will work just fine .
neutral	not what i expected .
neutral	took way to long to receive parts .
neutral	great price .
neutral	i purchased the mirror and it said ' painted white '
neutral	it was not painted .
neutral	i used auto_europe as a last_minute booking , just 00_minutes before needing the vehicle .
neutral	we had a minor_issue that the location wasn_'_t aware of my reservation but after a quick toll_free call and a wait of around 00_minutes , we were on our way .
neutral	i was unaware of a small charge and a deposit , but luckily everything was very smooth otherwise .
neutral	the on - line ordering_process behaved unexpectedly and it looked like i might have placed an order , then lost it .
neutral	i wanted to confirm that the order did not go through before attempting it again and called support .
neutral	the person on the other end kept on saying " elo " " elo " " elo " as if they could not hear me speaking .
neutral	tried to call again and got the same result .
neutral	after waiting for a few hours , and without an order confirmation of the first attempt , i went through the order process again which was successfull .
neutral	the products arrived within the estimated delivery time even_though european air freight was crippled because of the iceland volcano issue .
neutral	thanks .
neutral	item ordered before_midday as instructed , so reasonably expected the item to turn up the next_day ( friday ).
neutral	message from courier , to be delivered tuesday .
neutral	is it just me ...?
neutral	i personaly really like there clothing but i feel that there deliverary takes_forever even_tho it it express it still take quite some time to ship and process the order cause i ordered a few shirt from there and they still didn_'_t process my order yet so yeah .
neutral	i hope everything goes well and i get my clothing soon : d
neutral	rcvd the town car head_light configuration in perfect_shape due to great packing .
neutral	there are 0 metal strips that connect the lighting pack to the car .
neutral	0 went in without an a struggle however 0 hours_later , and 0 neighbor helping_me i finally used a chisel to break off plastic sections of the pack which allowed_me to get the pack installed securely in the car .
neutral	got my muscle driver timer as ordered .
neutral	had to call to inquire_about shipping .
neutral	received conformation_email that did not contain any shipping information .
neutral	called rep fitness and ryan was very helpful and he told me my clock was out for delivery that day !
neutral	got the clock .
neutral	clock was very well_packaged !
neutral	one sketchy thing that worries me , is when you look through the lens of the clock some of the material that covers the digital readout looks melted in areas of the number .
neutral	everything does function properly .
neutral	i do expect perfection for what i paid for the clock and hope it is not an issue down the road .
neutral	i was happy that my remote was black .
neutral	i thought it would have been white .
neutral	that '_s my 0 cent review
neutral	mi valoracion es buena solo empañada por un fallo en_el_envio , pero lo rectificaron a tiempo y recompensando la tardanza de mi pedido , su_servicio de seguimientos de pedidos muy correcto .
neutral	ordered 0 x tropic marin elimi - phos long life 000g .
neutral	received 0 x tropic marin elimi - phos long life 000g .
neutral	hoping this was a picking error ... awaiting response from charterhouse ?
neutral	also seemed to take a longer_than usual to receive the products .
neutral	order was placed 00st november but didn_'_t receive the products until 00th_november .
neutral	i like the site , usually it is a good place to search for good prices .
neutral	however depending_on the city , it is possible to find better rooms , instead of beds , for the same price ( or less ) in booking . com .
neutral	the netsuites website is terrible .
neutral	any website that you have to email out instructions to use should be updated , immediately .
neutral	i '_ve ordered from you guys for 0 years and love the products , just do something about the website .
neutral	i returned the part i ordered about a week_ago and have not heard back from parts_geek .
neutral	i have not received a refund yet .
neutral	i wasn_'_t able to speak with a customer rep . where '_s my refund ?
neutral	you will find the lowest_prices on quality parts but you will be charged a lot for shipping of light wait parts such as gaskets of radiator tops .
neutral	in the end its still the best site and way to shop for parts if you dont need them asap .
neutral	the delivery time is short .
neutral	ordered 0 bags of blue wilderness dog_food that was on sale .
neutral	it arrived quickly and was well_packaged to prevent_damage to the two 00lb_bags during shipping .
neutral	i was very happy with the order until a few_days_later my home phone rings and it '_s someone from pet_flow trying to push me to sign_up to receive regular shipments of food and sell me their other stuff .
neutral	while they might think this is great customer service on their part , i find it annoying that they use my customer information to solicit further sales by bothering me on my home phone .
neutral	now some might feel i '_m over - reacting but why do they need to bother me ( while i was trying to sleep no less ) when i didn_'_t ask for this type of service .
neutral	everything was great except returning the car .
neutral	the garmin got us to the rental_car return as i had saved the location when i originally rented the car but the paper check in was slow and the bus took over 00_minutes to show up to get us to the airport .
neutral	when it did arrive it was a standard configured bus so you had to drag your luggage into a seat or put it on your lap .
neutral	not a lot of fun under the tuscan sun .
neutral	these were not an exact_fit for my vehicle as_advertised and the picture makes them look to be a better quality than they are in reality .
neutral	your delivery to a merchant 0 km away is not so ' handy '.
neutral	strange with such a modern up to date find , select , buy , pay and then one have to fetch the goods 0 km away .
neutral	i ordered a hard_drive for a laptop and a " clone making " kit .
neutral	three_days_later i found a letter in my " spam " filter telling_me that two_days earlier my credit_card had come_back " not valid number ".
neutral	i tried for a half a day to call , but just sat " on hold " for an_hour at a time .
neutral	finally , four days after the initial order , i ordered again .
neutral	this time the hard_drive and transfer kit was shipped .
neutral	after i received it , every thing worked just fine .
neutral	laptop good as new .
neutral	glenn heard
neutral	0 .
neutral	if you purchase during a sale and need to return to a item for exchange you end up paying a non_- sale price .
neutral	0 .
neutral	return shipping should be part of the service .
neutral	0 .
neutral	sizing needs to be better described .
neutral	the higher end callaway , cb , etc .
neutral	seem to run larger compared to say russell .
neutral	this makes buying online difficult without abetter return_policy .
neutral	need a better way to integrate more information on map .
neutral	map takes up most of room on the page and complicates reviewing the listings .
neutral	needs improved vetting of facilities ; there '_s one particular spot in chicago called uncle bob '_s self_storage .
neutral	sounds shady and based on other reviews online yet not on sparefoot , it looks shady .
neutral	this does not translate to sparefoot '_s reviews .
neutral	also , was recent victim of bait and switch where advertised price was not reflective of true cost because the storage place i selected required $_00 / month in insurance , which was not represented in quote ,
neutral	very happy with the price , and the delivery was quick .
neutral	but , just two minutes after_placing my orders ( i ordered then forgot i wanted something else from them ), i contacted their customer_services to ask for both orders to be sent together to avoid a double delivery charge and to get a refund on one of them .
neutral	i was told that they had already been shipped ( inside two minutes ??
neutral	), so it wasn_'_t possible .
neutral	pity - there were some other things i wanted to buy from them but will probably go elsewhere now - they lost my business for the sake of a tenner .
neutral	i was disturbed by the fact that one of the 00 pound_bags of merrick dry_dog_food that i received had 0 small holes in it .
neutral	i won_'_t buy any food in a store if it is not completely sealed for safeness and freshness
neutral	the day was a bit spoiled by the extreme speed differentials .
neutral	race_cars and road cars do not mix .
neutral	i was having to compromise my lines to keep out peoples way
neutral	the service in rome is much_better_than last time i rented 0 years_ago .
neutral	the downside is still that the people when getting the car are not very interested , do you give you any receipt when you check back in , and it would be wonderful if the instruction book with the car were in english and not just in language of country where car is obtained .
neutral	i have only been a member for a bit over one month .
neutral	i did get a couple of alerts which were helpful
neutral	time will tell .
neutral	too early to post grade .
neutral	have not received all parts yet .
neutral	i am very happy with the two products i got from this company .
neutral	the delivery time was good .
neutral	some items are very over price and also do include a very high shipping and handling_fee .
neutral	i had to return a part , i was not able to talk to anyone .
neutral	it took more than three_days to finally send the part back .
neutral	plus , the communication between the company coming to pick the part and me , was not very efficient .
neutral	i was lucky to be home when it came and i was not ready with the part .
neutral	there is no way to speak to a customer service and e_-_mail takes 00 / 00_hours .
neutral	plus the messages or responses do not address customer questions .
neutral	some improvements need to be made .
neutral	i think .
neutral	thanks for allowing to express my frustration .
neutral	i will think_twice about purchasing again here .
neutral	missed out on a good jeep trail ride because the cooling_fan wasn_'_t in stock .
neutral	sure i could '_ve ordered sooner - but it '_s nice to be able to get the parts you need when you need them .
neutral	however , last time i ordered steering_stabilizer it came in a few_days sooner_than_expected .
neutral	a good overall experience .
neutral	but must send products via a courier service .
neutral	the postal service is too slow for something so important .
neutral	got the item fairly quickly which was a top , it '_s a shame it didn_'_t fit me what - so - ever , i called them to return it which was fine and they gave_me a reference_number .
neutral	i expected a refund a few_days_later which they gave_me as store credit ( i guess i should have read the fine_print before i ordered ), i rang them to sort out a refund which they said i ' d get after about 00_minutes of explaining that i couldn_'_t fit into any clothes on the site which i actually wanted , 0_weeks_later and still didn_'_t receive it .
neutral	in the end i gave up and just bought 0 hats i didn_'_t really want just to burn the credit which was now useless to me .
neutral	fast delivery gets a +
neutral	tracking your order is another +
neutral	easy returns was a +
neutral	no refunds and store credit only was a -
neutral	make_sure anything you ordered will fit you and you '_ll have a pleasant_experience , if you ' re like me though and can '_t fit into the clothes then you '_ll have lost your money .
neutral	my order arrived very quickly , unfortunatley idestroyed all the packaging the lights had no sequence switches and dont work . i informed festive_lights and give them their due they told me to return them for replacements , moral of the story is check items before binning packing my fault intirely still the chimes sound nice jim
neutral	found rear_strut inserts quickly for my saab .
neutral	the order process was quick and easy , pricing was competitive .
neutral	but , i found out as they were being installed , there were two types of connections to the suspension .
neutral	these units needed additional labor time and the savings were wiped out - plus by the extra time it took .
neutral	i ordered rejuvenate for dogs a year_ago and when i ordered more the expiration_date is the same as a year_ago .
neutral	in other_words the expiration_date is 0 / 0000 .
neutral	other than that it works well for my dog .
neutral	when i got there long lines people complaining ect
neutral	thats what happens everywhere though but the guy i dealt
neutral	with in paris didnt want to accomadate with any english
neutral	once i had my rental keys that was it could not ask anything
neutral	he just waved his hand as to say that way ... well the paris train_station is fairly big so i looked couldnt find the car so i went back to national whose desk agent took me exactly where the
neutral	cars are ... just because i didnt want to deal with that person
neutral	again ... just my view on it .
neutral	car was okay dont count on help in anyway though , that the paris nord station .
neutral	i '_m a size 0 , and typically wear a medium , i was a little_hesitant because of the material , so i purchased my dress in a size large , to get a little length , and i figured i would take it in , in the sides , because according to the size_chart , it would be too big , especially in the waist .
neutral	size_charts are way wrong .
neutral	the dress zips fine , but is so tight there is no way i will be able to wear it unless i lose 00 - 00 lbs .
neutral	on a bright note , it was only 00 bucks wasted , and shipping was very fast
neutral	i had to wait almost a month after i placed my order , and when i checked on the status i found out it was on a train that derailed in amarillo texas .
neutral	bomber lol
neutral	i really love the resources that are embedded into this web_site , e . g customer service , virtually trying the glasses , etc .
neutral	the glasses came in great quality but besides one of my glasses taking over ten days to be delivered and one customer representative giving me the run around everything was great .
neutral	the person that was assigned to help me with my order was great .
neutral	very wonderful and courteous person .
neutral	overall i would use frame direct again , because i would like to feel that those were just small bumps .
neutral	i appreciate the coupons but when i claim them the app on my phone doesn_'_t allows register it .
neutral	the website loads incredibly slow on my computer making ordering that much more frustrating .
neutral	i would use your service much more if not for having to jump_through all these hurdles to order .
neutral	customer service personell were very friendly but the discount_coupon on the web_site is wrong even_though it lets you check out using the coupon , you then get a call saying you owe more money and they have to run tour card again .
neutral	you should really fix that , because if it wasn ; t for the fact that i needed this and did not have time to find another one , i would have cancelled my order .
neutral	delivery took_longer_than i anticipated .
neutral	the price is a little high .
neutral	the glasses are excellent .
neutral	hi
neutral	the material arrived wrinkled due to poor protection in packaging .
neutral	it was an expensive product , which had not been careful in sending .
neutral	as the quality of the decal is very good .
neutral	cordially
neutral	trees arrived in excellent condition .
neutral	your website displayed trees grown anywhere in michigan , however on further_investigation , several other plant sites , only a very minor area of michigan will support plant .
neutral	i am not in that area ... if trees donot survive the winter i am out the cost , is this right
neutral	i tried to use your site to purchase my package and it was unavailable because of " shavous " which i guess is a holiday and thats fine but when i got a notification that the site was available it couldn_'_t find my product and the shopping_cart was empty .
neutral	i couldn_'_t find my original product and had to settle for something else ...
neutral	i was kind of put off by the whole thing because first i felt a little sketched out by " shavous " because thats not a holiday i assume you meant " shavuot " and then the original package wasn_'_t there even_though i had already begun check out when you shut the online site down .
neutral	if my company hadn_'_t already went through the process of approving b_&_h specifically for this purchase i would have went somewhere_else .
neutral	the products are really nice !
neutral	how ever i ordered and payed for a product that was not delivered .
neutral	only when i contacted boohoo . com i was informed that i would get a refund .
neutral	very un satisfied about this .
neutral	the screw_holes alignment was off .
neutral	the gauge or thickness of the inner_fender was half of the original .
neutral	close but no cigar .
neutral	site came up high in the bing search_results .
neutral	site '_s search_function returned the exact results i wanted , unlike others , that got confused , or just went off on a tangent .
neutral	descriptions of parts available decent - maybe could use a bit more detail ?
neutral	( for example , in my case , was item made of plastic or metal ?
neutral	i had to cross my fingers & hope .)
neutral	purchase system worked cleanly .
neutral	shipping info was accurate & carton arrived on time .
neutral	part installed fine .
neutral	0 - star_rating posted up .
neutral	then the " wheels fell_off the cart ."
neutral	a 0nd completely - surprise duplicate delivery i had received absolutely no warning of showed_up at my front_door .
neutral	now i have to sort it out ?
neutral	as of this posting , i '_m still_waiting for customer service to contact me with a resolution .
neutral	we '_ll see how that progresses .
neutral	you guys do a good job - the briefing was well_done i thought .
neutral	sometimes those [_link ] disobey the rules and pass on the right - naughty .
neutral	was really hacked off at the extra 00 quid for my second son to drive .
neutral	can '_t see any justification for such a high price .
neutral	00 quid would have been reasonable .
neutral	have just picked_up a mail from [_link ] and they are offering 00th_october all day for 000_pounds .
neutral	your price of £_000 for this monday just gone looks pretty expensive .
neutral	good to have coffee on tap all day .
neutral	i was [ language ] and very embarrassed by the woman at the pitstop diner who shouted at me and my sons for eating our sarnies at the back of the diner .
neutral	it was raining hard outside .
neutral	i do these days with my sons to share fun time with them before they leave home .
neutral	the day was kind i ' d spoilt by the 0 issues above .
neutral	bestilte vaskemaskine 00 dec . p . g . a .
neutral	jul m . m .
neutral	blev vi enige om levering 0 jan mellem 0 - 00 og transportfirmaet skulle ringe en time før .
neutral	kl .
neutral	00 . 00 ringede vi så til_dem , da_vi_ikke_havde hørt noget .
neutral	da de skulle ringe en time før , var de jo allerede forsinkede .. beskeden var at maskinen desværre stod i ringsted , så vi ville først få dem mandag morgen .
neutral	sød og_venlig herre jeg talte med , men vi_har efterhånden en_del vask der trænger til_en omgang :-) god service fra banditten da_vi talte med_dem tidligere , fornuftige_priser , men logistikken trækker godt ned ...
neutral	i was extremely happy i finally found the correct battery to fit my 00occ scooter but the battery was not in stock , shipping was super high , cost almost as much as the battery itself !
neutral	total_cost was over a hundred_dollars ..
neutral	still have not received my battery and its been 0 0 / 0_weeks already .
neutral	we were on two different buses .
neutral	the folks hawking the tickets in the street are much more interesting than the guides , who seemed - truthfully - really bored .
neutral	information was incomplete , and really pretty uninteresting .
neutral	the guides sat slumped in their seats , quite unhappy to have to be there .
neutral	i chose big_bus because one of the guide books said the quality of the tour_guides was superior .
neutral	if this is true , i wouldn_'_t want to be anywhere_near the other bus lines .
neutral	i wanted more history , more trivia , more everything !
neutral	we also took a royal walking_tour - this was good , interesting energetic - everything i expected on the buses .
neutral	i haven , t received my part and it is 0 day shie of a week .
neutral	i thought the fasteners to install this part ( an inner wheel well liner ) would be included with it , but they weren_'_t , so that was a disappointment .
neutral	good price .
neutral	could do a lot better on communications and delivery .
neutral	i recieved my product in quick time , no_problems that way but when i opened up the product my t shirt had a pink mark on it .
neutral	i don_'_t know what it was but i washed the t shirt and it was fine
neutral	i attempted to put in my billing_address multiple_times to get it accurate .
neutral	every time i did , it left off a line .
neutral	i have :
neutral	name
neutral	street address
neutral	po_box
neutral	city , state and zip
neutral	it would only recognize :
neutral	name
neutral	street address
neutral	city , state and zip
neutral	this caused a series of emails back and forth to correct and delayed the confirmation and shipment of my order .
neutral	this was unnecessary if you had a website that would accept what i entered .
neutral	received the wrong part .
neutral	contacted parts_geek customer service via_email , informing them of the problem .
neutral	received a reply from customer service describing the part they shipped ( automatic_transmission dipstick tool ).
neutral	nothing further .
neutral	no remedy offered .
neutral	nothing .
neutral	i went back on - line and confirmed the description of the part i had originally ordered ( replacement automatic_transmission dipstick ) and contacted parts_geek customer service included the description , part number and price of the part .
neutral	requested this issue be corrected .
neutral	waiting for a reply from parts_geek customer service .
neutral	door busters are great deals and the price for nature '_s balance food was decent too .
neutral	if you try to change quantities at checkout , make_sure to triple_check that it worked right .
neutral	don_'_t use this site if you are ordering a major brand of dry_food .
neutral	they lie about the msrp and then make it look like a deal .
neutral	hemp_protein is great , and knowing onnit , they probably chose one of the best quality hemp proteins you can find !
neutral	however , one thing i noticed was that the taste was very overpowering .
neutral	given , my first time trying it , i mixed it with dark chocolate flavored almond milk ( not the smartest idea ), but then when i tried mixing it with just regular almond milk , it seemed to do little to the taste .
neutral	also , if you consider the price and quantity that you get for it , it feels more like your paying for the onnit brand rather_than the actual food ( i could be wrong about this though ).
neutral	overall it '_s a great quality product , but so long as i '_m on a budget , i won_'_t be buying this product again .
neutral	i ordered pair of persol_sunglasses and right_away got an_email about my order from sarah which i thought was great .
neutral	it took close to a week before i got another update saying they were shipped .
neutral	( i got the impression that framesdirect doesn_'_t actually have a backstock and instead placed an order for the glasses , inspected them , and then forwarded them to me .)
neutral	i got the glasses but it turns_out i sized them wrong and needed to exchange for the next size down .
neutral	so i did my exchange / return per the website instructions .
neutral	it took fd a week to contact me saying my return was received after the tracking_# said it had been delivered .
neutral	( i had to contact them to find out what was going on as i was worried my package had been misplaced ).
neutral	i spoke with another employee ( i think karen ) who said my exchange would be processed and the smaller glasses would be shipped immediately .
neutral	now it '_s a week_later and i still don_'_t have a tracking_# for the new glasses .
neutral	no_idea if they have been shipped or what '_s going on ... i '_ll give them til the end of the week before calling again .
neutral	in summary ... great prices .... extremely slow shipping speeds .... lack of communication sucks .
neutral	the wait would be much more acceptable if i atleast knew what was going on .
neutral	next_day delivery was not next_day
neutral	i recently bought a gold bar and an american gold eagle coin ; they sent me 0 emails stating that both items have the same tracking_number .
neutral	i assumed therefore that the two items would be delivered in the same box ; only one item came in the box .
neutral	i called and they told me that their delivery service made a mistake and they would send me the other item ; the item arrived this monday but i was not home at the time since they did not tell me the tracking_number for the missed item .
neutral	usps left me a note stating that i could pick_up the item later that day ; they also said that i would be charged $_00 . 00 for shipment .
neutral	i had to call the company again ; a very good woman told me that this is incorrect and she would take_care of the matter .
neutral	she did ; i picked_up the order and now ( after all of this !)
neutral	everything is ok .
neutral	two very large mistakes ; their shipping department needs to be talked to !
neutral	otherwise , a good company .
neutral	hard to understand reservation taker .
neutral	accent was very difficult .
neutral	had to ask to repeat information several_times .
neutral	i purchased a xoom on the 00th with 0 - 0 day shipping ; the item wasn_'_t marked as shipped for another several days - the product barely made it on christmas_eve .
neutral	this is the second xoom i '_ve purchased in the last 0 months from n0_wireless ; both_times i '_ve made the purchase , the sd_card cover was missing .
neutral	the products work great , and i '_ve had no_problems with the product themselves , just a couple frustrating points of the purchase .
neutral	should improve website design
neutral	the facility , management and hours are satisfactory .
neutral	however , after moving in , the repetitive price increases have made it economically untenable to stay .
neutral	there are comparable facilities for substantially_less doing_business . in the area .
neutral	product was good , but could only be delivered by courier and signed for , this is on envelopes that cost £ 0 . 00 .
neutral	i can '_t see any reason_why this could not have been sent by royal_mail .
neutral	it is true you cant_beat their prices but their shipping is a rape job
neutral	ordered a bikini top for jeep .
neutral	no cushioning inside box at all0 fortunatel , nothing was damaged .
neutral	web_site has no way to save your address or vehicle .
neutral	site is more difficult to use than it should be .
neutral	i ordered 0 custom gift_cards worth $_000 in a single order .
neutral	also added custom greeting cards with photos .
neutral	i had them all shipped to my house .
neutral	each card arrived on a different day .
neutral	they came in a stamped envelope with my address .
neutral	there were no blank envelopes for me to write the recipient '_s name .
neutral	why not throw all 0 envelopes into a large one and ship at once that would have mades sense .
neutral	i called customer service and asked if they can send me 0 blank envelopes .
neutral	i was told they would " create a ticket ".
neutral	that '_s all i heard from them .
neutral	i had to purchase my own envelopes .
neutral	the photo gift_cards were a great idea , but i would not buy from giftcards . com ever again .
neutral	if you have upgraded shipping to 0nd day air , why would they allow package headed to florida to be shipped on a friday .
neutral	it sat all weekend in memphis
neutral	i do not like waiting on my order to ship !!!
neutral	but they ( 0wheel_drive ) have always shipped fast in the past .
neutral	don_'_t like it when my item is out of stock or slow to process .
neutral	i have used multitrip a number of times for annual or period only medical insurance .
neutral	i am not dissatisfied with my general dealings with multitrip although as yet luckily i have never had to make a claim .
neutral	a significant annoyance to me is that you have decided to use a revenue earning 0000 number and there does not seem to be an_alternative geographic 00 / 00 / 00 alternative .
neutral	i assume your main business is associated with selling insurance rather_than peripheral revenue earning via the 0000 number .
neutral	if this is the case then you should not be potentially turning customers away that object to using revenue earning phone numbers .
neutral	many people including myself pay for an inclusive phone package that allows free calls to 00 / 00 / 00 geographical phone numbers .
neutral	having paid our phone provider for this privilege it is rather upsetting that we then have to pay again when calling an 0000 or similar number .
neutral	in summary please give your customers an option to use a geographical phone_number to contact multitrip .
neutral	thank_you .
neutral	used this insurance last_year and thought the first question would be " has your medical condition changed since last_year or do you have any new medical condition " but was disappointed to have to go thru whole medical_history again . may as well have just shopped_around .
neutral	we had booked a car that would fit 0 adults and 0 suitcases ( considering we were coming on holiday we would all have a suitcase !).
neutral	the car they tried to give us and which they said was comparable to that which we had booked , had two fold down seats taking up the whole of the boot so there was no space for our_luggage .
neutral	the initial staff_member we spoke to tried to make us pay for an upgrade but another member of staff spoke to colleagues and simply swapped us over to a car where the extra seats still provided a flat boot space .
neutral	all was fine in the end but by this time we had been in the airport for over an_hour sorting this .
neutral	a reasonable response , although a little_slow , possibly due to christmas postage problems
neutral	having used this kind of service twice in the last couple of months i have discovered that it is cheaper to deal directly with the motel / hotel .
neutral	the service is polite and courteous but the rate for the room is higher_than if you handle your reservation directly with the vendor .
neutral	ordered set of xt rims , cassette , pedals on 00th_feb .... now 0th_march and have not seen a thing .
neutral	tnt very slow .
neutral	very good drop_off .
neutral	bad pick_up
neutral	i ordered black and cyan ink for my printer and paid by check .
neutral	it took nearly a month to get here not ten days .
neutral	when it got here i got black and yellow ink .
neutral	i will keep the yellow as i will use it eventually .
neutral	i just ordered the cyan to be paid for by credit_card .
neutral	i will see if i get the right stuff in a timely_manner .
neutral	first time customer , like so_far .
neutral	i do use your site on a regular_basis .
neutral	it is easy to navigate and shipping of parts is generally quick .
neutral	i am happy when i find quality oes parts for my european and japanese vehicles .
neutral	but lately it seems that more parts from partsgeek are cheap replacement parts such as gates and stant .
neutral	often times these parts don_'_t even fit the application , and i don_'_t bother with returns .
neutral	if i can be sure of the quality then i would come to partsgeek for all my parts needs .
neutral	the good : the ordering_process was quick and was followed_up by a phone_call from the company explaining how to look after the item i ordered , the delivery process and offering insurance ( which i declined ).
neutral	the delivery company communications were excellent too , initially given a delivery day and then the day before , a 0 hour delivery window .
neutral	delivery was on schedule and efficient .
neutral	in terms of quality the item looks good and feels fairly solid .
neutral	the ' could do better ': the item ordered came in three substantial sections .
neutral	the delivery company provided a leaflet explaining that they did not unpackage the goods or set them up , and left .
neutral	so i was left with the problem of how to get three heavy pieces of furniture out of their boxes and assembled ( plus disposing of considerable amounts of packaging ).
neutral	it would have been good to know this in advance of ordering as i would probably have shopped elsewhere , the ' minimal assembly ' referred to on the company web_site was designed to be straightforward , but in practice some of parts proved not to fit precisely enough , so not all the bolts could be put in place .
neutral	this caused considerable frustration , particularly as accessing the bolts required a step ladder .
neutral	the solid appearance of the furniture was let_down by flimsy handles .
neutral	i really thought i was talking to the ga parks people and found that not to be the case .
neutral	reservation service was godd but restrictions are not .
neutral	price was excellent , love the product .
neutral	however , it is apparent that the " new " unit i purchased was in fact a " used " and returned one .
neutral	there were scratches and chipped paint , and all bolts , washers and other hardware were missing .
neutral	i was able to replace the bolts and washers at my local ace hardware , but at a cost of over $ 0 . 00 .
neutral	the unit installed very easily , and i am satisfied with it .
neutral	i am not satisfied with partsgeek . com for selling me a " used " unit without all the parts included .
neutral	buyer_beware on that one .
neutral	courier did not deliver on day it said it would .
neutral	finally arrived 0 days_later .
neutral	received an_email to say you were refunding on one of my items but as other items in my order were same value did not know which item you were refunding me for and no mention of this in ' my account .'
neutral	this stopped me getting replacement present in time for someone before_christmas .
neutral	if you are out of stock on an item why do you tell customer that there order is ready .
neutral	why do you take 0 days to get an order ready and then rely_on next_day couriers .
neutral	if you got orders ready earlier you could get better deal with couriers on 0 - 0 day deliveries .
neutral	recently i made 0 orders , they were accepted then two of them were out of stock .
neutral	that is 00_% and totally_unacceptable .
neutral	if internet companies publish and accept the order they should have it in stock and keep their inventory under control .
neutral	disgruntles customer .
neutral	i think your organization provides a great service , but is lacking in the approval of perscriptions .
neutral	as for many , our pets are our life and part of the family .
neutral	i generally hope these medications will show up in a timely_manner and am concered at how long it takes to get approvals .
neutral	i want to order regularly from you , but unsure at this point if you are reliable .
neutral	i have used air park several_times and will probably continue to use it for future trips .
neutral	my recent_trip was supposed to leave for the terminal at 0 : 00 a . m .
neutral	it did not leave
neutral	until the van was fully_loaded at 0 : 00 a . m .
neutral	the delay caused our arrival at the security
neutral	check point to a long line for another half_hour delay .
neutral	the resulting lost time meant
neutral	we had no time for breakfast before boarding the 0 : 00 a . m . departure gate .
neutral	along with the tables you had in atlanta we ordered chairs that aren_'_t scheduled to ship until 0 / 0 / 00 and stools until 0 / 00 / 00 !!
neutral	!
neutral	what '_s up with the delay ?
neutral	too_long between sailings and nothing to do . no cafe nothing to brows while waiting
neutral	guys were walking around moving tires when they could have been attending to the several people who were on line .
neutral	i had to wait a good 00_minutes just to get my car keys back on service that was completed and paid for .
neutral	the website has changed .
neutral	i used to be able to search flights based on a date window of 0 days .
neutral	i was not able to do that this time .
neutral	booking was between 0 . 00 and 0000 hours but turnedup after 0000hrs .
neutral	was a good exexperience after that but failed again asthe fitter was not able to give me a receipt stating his printer on the van was broken .
neutral	the part wasn_'_t was described properly .
neutral	it was called a tuner when in fact it was no more than a monitor .
neutral	then when it was time to return it i was unable to talk with anyone to tell them of the problem .
neutral	i guess i would rather talk to a real_person then by e_-_mail .
neutral	the part was listed for a ford_f - 00 chassis but in fact it doesn_'_t fit .
neutral	the service was very quick but the colour of the dab radio we ordered wasn_'_t the one we got .
neutral	as it turned_out it didn_'_t matter but it would have been nice to know before our money was taken .
neutral	great option for getting your jobs out there .
neutral	not a full blown ats .
neutral	probably a good option for corporate recruiters , not 0rd_party or agency recruiters .
neutral	it takes an_absolute age to get your cashback , and then quidco hang on to your money for as long as they can .
neutral	if you want to use quidco then get ready to chase them up to get them to pay up .
neutral	the service would have been much_better and would expedite transactions if this site had csr '_s available to confirm parts chosen were correct and available .
neutral	the confirmation alone took two_days .
neutral	got us to spain without_any delays .
neutral	booking process was frustrating and they added extra tax at the last_minute .
neutral	i still prefer easyjet .
neutral	i ordered a pair of hradlights for my car .
neutral	not a odd car just a saturn .
neutral	website was fine .
neutral	processing and shipping were fine .
neutral	parts didnt fit .
neutral	return process they took some time thats ok . having ti pay for return shipping noy pleased with .
neutral	i have ordered a lot of parts online and retutned a lot of parts online .
neutral	dont yhink i have had to ever pay for returning the parts .
neutral	still_waiting on refund which is fine dont think they have received package yet .
neutral	they paid what they first offered , but were very slow to process the payment !
neutral	i would recommend this company to a friend , but warn them !
neutral	topcashback has_been getting gradually worse over the past_year .
neutral	merchants were failing to track , then they stopped paying out with no means of reversing the decision , then topcashback started making you pay for their service & most recently , they decided to change , in the face of established consumer laws , the terms & conditions on one of their cashback offers .
neutral	at the time of redemption , the offer was tracked , but a day later a message was sent out to all customers saying that the cashback was not valid unless the subscription was carried over into a second month , incurring a cost of £_00 .
neutral	the cashback was for £_00 & as such was of no interest to me .
neutral	topcashback have flaunted advertising law by refusing to honour what they originally advertised & i for one will steer well clear of these crooks now .
neutral	update_: topcashback have done a 000 on this recent gaffe & appear to be honouring the original advertised offer .
neutral	i am cautiously raising my rating back to 0_stars & will see how things progress .
neutral	there has certainly still been a drop_off in service since i originally signed_up for this site but hopefully things are improving .
neutral	after the easy set_up , i was happy with the voip connection / service .
neutral	however , after using it for a month , i am not happy with the echoes that i am experiencing .
neutral	my callers are commenting .
neutral	i was thinking of signing_up for a contract , but will give it a while longer .
neutral	the mounting slot on the garage_door sensors was on the wrong side .
neutral	mounting made it difficult because any bracket you use covers up the
neutral	indicator light .
neutral	if the slot was designed on the opposite_side of the sensor
neutral	light ( as my old one is ) the i could have used the existing bracket and would
neutral	have save a lot of time and frustration .
neutral	i '_ve got the new ones mounted but it
neutral	really looks rink - dink .
neutral	i travel a lot , and as a rule of tumb i always take the hop on hop_off bus when is the first time i visit a city ; this time i traveled with my mom and aunt and it was their first time so we took the big_bus because it had big coverage , plus we got a discount if booked for the exact day online .
neutral	everything was good until we arrived to take the bus for the first time at baker_street on april 0rd .
neutral	we were lining up and the man in charge was sending people into an already overcrowded bus and sending empty buses away ..
neutral	when i told_him i wasn_'_t going to go standing on the inside of the bus , he told me bluntly that was my choice to make , so i told_him that if i wanted to be on the inside of a bus i would have bought and oyster card for me and my family , and then he got really irritated while telling_me that bug bus job is only to take us from point a to point b ..... regardless of the seat .... and that all big buses are as packed as the first one ..
neutral	wow ... so much for a first_impression ... eventually a bus where people could take a seat and get what they paid for stopped ( contradicting his forecast ) and we_boarded .
neutral	from then on the bus was what i was expecting and uneventful so i could say i was satisfied .
neutral	however take this advise : make_sure the staff that '_s dealing_with the customer have some basic customer service skills .
neutral	first_impressions do count and you want to make the best of your business during the olympics .
neutral	test_equipment seems to be a good company good prices lots of merchandise , problem is there sipping department is terrible , took three_times to get my package to me with my product in it , they worked with me until i got my product
neutral	there is a need for installment plans .
neutral	jeg_købte 0 charles eames stole og_fik dem leveret_som_lovet .
neutral	dog er_der en_fejl på som de_har sagt de gerne vil starte en reklamation på .
neutral	herefter har_jeg intet_hørt fra_dem siden , har både skrevet til info og complaints e_- mailen .
neutral	håber de svarer på_deres trustpilot , sådan er_der jo nogle der driver deres forretning ..
neutral	got ship the wrong part .
neutral	in which i know i double_check before ordering if only parts_geek bad a live . person to talk to about there parts would ve save me time & money .
neutral	i purchased 0 visa_gift_cards because i really_liked the uniqueness of being_able to personalize the cards with a picture .
neutral	the cards arrived in a reasonable_amount of time ; however , some of the pictures that i wanted to use wouldn_'_t adapt to the card per their web code .
neutral	it is a great concept and i was able to find some photos that worked .
neutral	the 0_star_rating is simply because the cost of the service was greater than the face value of the cards , but , hey , it '_s christmas and my shopping is done !
neutral	originally i thought the service offered quite low_prices for all of my games a total of £_00 worth i decided to only sell a few of the games to music_magpie and sell the rest on ebay which turned_out to be a bad descision as for example 0 game sold for £_00 after ebay fees and paypal and postage i ended_up with £_00 which was a £ 0 loss on sale price where as music_magpie offered me £_00 for the game which had no other fees involved .
neutral	received first part broken due to poor shipping / packing .
neutral	took one week to get refund , then an_additional 0_weeks to get the part reordered and another week to receive !
neutral	easy to navigate , easy to make payment .
neutral	the service was excellent but we have now used up all the product but the rats have eaten it all and still keep_coming_back !
neutral	they seem to like eating it but it does not kill them .
neutral	web experience : very good to search and look up products but has room to improve for easier buying process .
neutral	pricing : very high ; could be more competitive .
neutral	auto_europe -- hertz -- me
neutral	0 ) location fee paid far from airport , train , ferry , bus station
neutral	my info did not mention subway station .
neutral	did i mis interpret
neutral	0 ) my info paper from auto_europe stated " not more than 00 euros
neutral	paid at drop_off ".
neutral	i paid 00 euros
neutral	please explain pick_up location fee when location not at train , bus , airport , ferry station .
neutral	i put serious and important feedback to you today and , because it took time to think through and compose , you ' timed me out ' saying i should start all over again .
neutral	perhaps you are looking for one liners rather_than serious and constructive feedback .
neutral	please don_'_t trouble me again .
neutral	ordered a small , lightweight part - shipping cost about 00_% of the cost of the part .
neutral	should have shipped part by priority flat_rate usps .
neutral	would have been cheaper and gotten part a lot quicker
neutral	shipped my clubs on tuesday but they were not delivered until the following_monday_afternoon .
neutral	had to rent clubs the first day in myrtle_beach so the $_00 shipping fee was negated by my out of pocket costs .
neutral	there is nothing to be said about ordering and delivering , everything just works like a charm .
neutral	but in my opinion the store need to describe the products better in terms of battery_life on the e_- cigs and online usermanuals , since the manual in the pakage " stinks " and is downright worthless for a first time user of the product .
neutral	also i think it would be a good idea to recommend compatible products under each items page .
neutral	billet électronique incomplet : il manque une référence de_réservation pour gérer mon dossier . ex : choisir mes sièges .
neutral	fâcheux !!!!
neutral	!
neutral	si vous avez reçu un billet électronique par e_-_mail , le code à six caractères alphanumériques qui apparaît à droite du champ booking reference ( référence de_réservation ) est votre référence .
neutral	elle commencera avec b , c , d , e , f , g , h , i , j , k ou l .
neutral	i ordered an item on march 0rd and phoned to ' chase ' it up on the 00th as it hadn_'_t arrived by then .
neutral	i was assured it would be picked and sent 0st_class that day .
neutral	when it hadn_'_t arrived by the 00th i emailed stating how i was unimpressed with their service .
neutral	within minutes of emailing i received an apologetic phone_call , telling_me the item was out of stock , but would be in the warehouse the next_day , the thursday and would be picked and sent out the next_day , friday , first_class and with p_&_p waived .
neutral	nice promises , but still_awaiting my order !!
neutral	!
neutral	the wording under the star_rating is misleading - because on this particular occasion i '_m tempted to give a 0 or 0_star_rating for delivery , but to emphasize that at no time has anyone been rude to me - quite the reverse in fact and i feel that whoever i have spoken to has tried to help , but the fact remains that at the time of writing this i am still no nearer to receiving my order .
neutral	i have ordered from the happy puzzle company in the past and fair to say that i have been very happy both with products and delivery and i will most_likely order from them again .
neutral	this particular shopping_experience would be a wrong example to judge the company by , but it is an honest attempt at reviewing my latest experience .
neutral	so we get to the desk , the agent is very nice , sets us up with our car and we go to the lot to pick it up .
neutral	what do we find , a car half the size of the one we thought we booked based on the picture we were given by the web_site .
neutral	i realize that " or similar " means we are not getting the car pictured but this was ridiculous ... we went back to the desk and showed the picture of the car we thought we booked , the agent told us that the car pictured was 0 class sizes larger than what we paid for ... or similar my butt , not even close .
neutral	after much complaining and begging , the agent at the desk grudgingly gave_us a car 0 class above what we paid for , being march , it was probably easier to do , however , come the peak summer season , i will have to rethink booking with auto_europe !
neutral	!
neutral	flowers were fine , but delivered after 0pm which had me concerned they had been lost .
neutral	you take to long to pay out
neutral	i would have preferred if an impact tool was not used to remove and retighted my allow wheel_nuts !
neutral	i would recommend the river_cruise , a great way to see the city from the water .
neutral	the bus_tour was too_long for young_children ( 0 - 0 y ) with long stops ( took 0 hours to see one third of the red_route ) , also if you sit at the back of the top of the bus , we couldn_'_t hear any of the commentary .
neutral	one shirt no button on sleave you had a jock on me will not come_back rip_off 00 waist was 00
neutral	the search and booking process was ok .
neutral	but , when i pressed the link to print the voucher , 00 !!!
neutral	pages came out of the printer .
neutral	i ordered wiper_blades with standard shipping / delivery .
neutral	the confirmation of shipment / delivery email included a tracking_number , but it didn_'_t specify what service provider / carrier was used to ship the package .
neutral	i was unable to track the status of the delivery of the package , and there was no convenient way to contact a parts_geek representative for assistance .
neutral	ich verstehe nicht wieso bei_einer buchung die summe belastet wird und zusätzlich auf meiner karte die ganze summe nochmals blockiert wird .
neutral	nach einem monat wird das dann auf_der karte wieder freigegeben und_ist erst dann wieder verfügbar .
neutral	bei_einer debitkarte kann das mühsam sein .
neutral	hatte nur noch wenig geld auf_der karte und konnte im restaurant nicht zahlen , weil die summe blockiert war .
neutral	ich_habe jetzt zwar noch geld auf_dem konto , kann es aber nicht beziehen , weil die summe noch ein monat blockiert ist .
neutral	das_ist besonders im urlaub ärgerlich !
neutral	they listed a oil drain_plug washer for dodge caravan , but it wouldnt fit over the drain_plug .
neutral	the parts i ' v bought from partsgeek most of the time fit a couple of times they didn_'_t it was because the description wasn_'_t clear it just said it would fit they took the parts back ok and didn_'_t charge me a restocking_fee but it still cost me $_00 .
neutral	in shipping fee to return the parts so there went my savings its a good deal if you have no_problems if its a big part or if your in a hury you need to buy local and they asked me to fill_out a servey for a $_00 .
neutral	coupon and i did when i got my $_00 .
neutral	off next order i have to spend $_000 .
neutral	to get it that won_'_t happen a gain .
neutral	the front exhaust_pipe was to long at the header so it drops down and hits the sway_bar , the twist of the exhaust_pipe is off so it does not line up with the cat .
neutral	hook up .
neutral	service was great and once i figured the internal rail was too narrow for the slot i got a pen knife and cuticle scissors and with some cuts got the part to fit and it works as it should .
neutral	it was too inexpensive to go through the hassle of a return .
neutral	after i received the bulbs i ordered , i noticed that the r00 bulbs didnt have the same lumen spec .
neutral	on the packaging as specified on the website .
neutral	i sent them the following message and never_heard back :
neutral	" i just received my shipment .
neutral	i am a little_confused in that your website specification for the satco s0000 indicates the initial lumens to be 000 yet the package they come in shows the lumens rating at 000 .
neutral	i purchased these in part because of the higher lumen rating .
neutral	can you help me understand the difference ?"
neutral	all in all everything_went good .
neutral	altough once our sales man realized that everything was gonna be good and the car was sold he kinda left us hanging on some things because he was trying to get another sell before the night was over and pushed some last minuet things on to some other sales men and that took even longer now that we have the car home im realizing that i have a lug_nut missing on front driver_side wheel and i have some chrome comming off around driver_side head_light and i live a hour and hlaf away its not like i can just pop back in to get it taken_care of so it looks_like im_gonna have to take_care of it myself
neutral	good bits -
neutral	john was very co - operative and helpful .
neutral	he was on time at the airport for my car pickup .
neutral	he went_above and beyond by dropping me from the west hindmarsh to the tram stop to head back into the city .
neutral	the car itself is clean and well_maintained .
neutral	no_complains there .
neutral	bad bits -
neutral	i opted to pay the extra insurance to reduce the excess from $ 0000 to $ 0 .
neutral	while i booked the car from adelaideairportrentals , they didn_'_t explain that in the event of an incident , i would be out - of - pocket with the excess $ 0000 .
neutral	and then i would have to put a claim with the 0rd_party to get the money back .
neutral	this is misleading insurance sales and deceptive conduct in my opinion .
neutral	i would strongly_recommend that the sales process be reviewed wherein customers are notified up - front about the policy .
neutral	the other criticism i have is the surcharge for using credit_cards .
neutral	again , the person taking the booking did not mention this over the phone .
neutral	while this is not a huge burden financially , i would prefer to have the option to pay for the car_rental without_incurring a surcharge .
neutral	australian laws mandates that all service providers permit customers with a payment option that does not incur surcharges .
neutral	the fact i was not offered this option suggests that your organisation is using the surcharge as a revenue stream .
neutral	first off it is the wrong color i asked for black and they sent me brown .
neutral	i emailed them but never got a response .
neutral	i don_'_t think they understand the issue .
neutral	they drop shipped a steering_rack to me , $_000 . 00 dollars later the rack has a leak in the left fixed return line .
neutral	now i have to remove the rack and send it back .
neutral	i have the old rack boxed and ready to go .
neutral	i don_'_t particularily feel that i should now be responsible for the shipping of either part to return .
neutral	i requested a box and two shipping labels to return said parts but only get automated answers via_email .
neutral	not a happy_camper !!
neutral	!
neutral	i received two of my three items , had emails for them and all .
neutral	then nothing for three_days , and then the third package showed_up , no marks on the box .
neutral	i opened the pack , and inside was a clearly abused smaller box surrounded_by packing softener .
neutral	obviously the item was broken before it left the warehouse , but they still sent it , and the broken off pieces weren_'_t even in the box .
neutral	the other two items were good quality , and exactly_what i wanted .
neutral	requested information about product to link to my website .
neutral	information was slow to return and then basic and not really helpful
neutral	product arrived exactly as ordered and was dispatched very quickly .
neutral	my problem however was with dpd the courier service chosen for delivery .
neutral	i was not able to arrange for the company to deliver to a neighbor .
neutral	the website was very unhelpful and their customers services non_existent .
neutral	part was not what it showed on line , on line it showed the wiring_harness and this is a part i really needed .
neutral	i will use the lens but i really needed the harness .
neutral	it does do the job , wrt slowing_down eating , but the passages are so small , the dog cant ever get it all , so either you waste food , or have to dump whats left into another bowl anyways .
neutral	overall satisfaction on the vehicle was good .
neutral	car handle pretty good and was pleasant to drive .
neutral	bad was the exterior of the car looked like it wasn_'_t washed somewhat dirty usually first look is your last look .
neutral	also no one in the lot trying to help the customer had to look for 0 and really they didn_'_t care .
neutral	also when returning back to the lot the signs at the airport were small and for a tourist to find it becomes hard .
neutral	when i arrived back to the lot it was before open but no signs for returning the contract and keys had to wait for the office to open in order to return vehicle
neutral	one and a half weeks since beginning and it seems to be working .
neutral	the dog absolutely hates the taste , so we ' re trying all_sorts of ways to get it into him .
neutral	could_possibly change my rating when more time has lapsed .
neutral	i found for the second time in less_than a year , that the gas_tank was only 0 / 0 full .
neutral	the brakes ( front right ) were grinding .
neutral	when i checked out a road tax ( surcharge ) was applied ( 00 euros ) it should be mandatory that this stuff is disclosed up front ,!!!
neutral	!
neutral	would stoll rent from you .
neutral	delivery of item good .
neutral	no instructions on how to return old core , since core_charge was billed .
neutral	ok , was ok price , best i could find on the internet , or even the only one that would actually buy my phone , not the fastest but everything_went through fine .
neutral	this is likely one of the best archives of great music and print information on the 0000 '_s .
neutral	yet , all too often is the disappointment of ordering something and seeing only when the order arrives there is something out of stock .
neutral	at_least twice i was notified all things were shipped , but when opening was told no - ' such or such was unavailable ' and that they do not backorder .
neutral	still ... super catalogue of 0000 '_s media .
neutral	while the parts were available , the absence of any ability to talk to a human was frustrating when the order program hung_up and generated a duplicate order which cannot be cancelled .
neutral	then you are stuck_paying the shipping .
neutral	this was a mixed experience .
neutral	i would use partsgeek again , but only as a last_resort .
neutral	i ordered two strut_assembly parts , received both in rough shape they are still usable but was not impressed by the condition .
neutral	these are solid suspension parts and they looked as if they were dropped repeatedly chipped paint and damaged steel . the shipping boxes came in great shape the parts boxes inside were destroyed so either the employee who shipped these is blind or doesn_'_t care but the parts are the correct ones thats a plus .
neutral	prices are great , slow shipping however .
neutral	ordered on a sunday_afternoon and it didnt get shipped out until tiesday night and didn_'_t get it until tuesday the following week .
neutral	would like an express shipping option maybe or free shipping for orders over x amount of dollars etx etc
neutral	i went looking for a part for my envoy so typed in auto_parts .
neutral	looked at several sites and item didn_'_t look exactly_what i needed .
neutral	went on parts_geek and saw the itema nd ordered it .
neutral	well wasn_'_t the same a swhat i took off .
neutral	i sent part back and insured and got confirmation of they recieved it but i wasn_'_t getting back all my money .
neutral	they charged a restocking_fee or like $_00 + some change .
neutral	no where on the site is it mentioned about restocking_fee .
neutral	okay they offered free shipping but i had to pay to ship it back along with insuring it .
neutral	which wa s $_00 + some change .
neutral	so all in all it cost me over $_00 dollars out my pocket for them posting and sending a part that wasn_'_t listed properly as exact_replacement part .
neutral	disgusted buyer .
neutral	never use them againa nd if soemoen asks about ordering form them i will say stay_away .
neutral	you can call em as i don_'_t care i am just fed up by being_ripped_off .
neutral	richard b . dunham
neutral	( 000 ) 000 0000
neutral	en italie , l ' assurance est incluse .
neutral	j ' ai_eu un miroir brisé , je_l ' ai signalé et_j ' ai_eu des frais d ' administration .
neutral	à_mon retour au canada , j ' ai une facture de 00 $ d ' adeministration et une taxe que_je croyais avoir payé .
neutral	facture de plus de 000 $ ca à_mon retour .
neutral	c ' est_très couteux .
neutral	ok pour_le reste .
neutral	je_suis très content de voiture louée .
neutral	order one part for my car and it was sent to california .
neutral	i live in georgia .
neutral	response to e_-_mail support_ticket was quick .
neutral	problem was resolved .
neutral	will give another chance when next get paid and order the rest of my parts .
neutral	you must put accurate_descriptions and photos of parts
neutral	looked for a " group " deal and found one for newark_airport long_term_parking .
neutral	the location for us was very convenient right off route 00 .
neutral	the staff was very helpful on the lot pulling in .
neutral	we travelled with a group of 0 and they loaded us up with all our gear right_away and got us to our terminal quickly .
neutral	upon return we got our bags , called in , and in 0 minutes they were waiting outside .
neutral	however our flight had been delayed so we were moved to another airline and arrived a couple of hour late .
neutral	they said at checkout i arrived just outside the two hour " window " so they charged me an extra day .
neutral	if that had not happened is give them 0 out of 0_stars .
neutral	that was the final zinger to a long day .
neutral	received telephone_call advising me my full order was not in stock , and was given chance to refund full order .
neutral	i liked the prices on the replacement parts .
neutral	the only problem was the item had a slight_damage to it .
neutral	it was because of the packaging , there wasn_'_t any bubble_wrap or packing_paper so the corner of the taillight was chipped .
neutral	but overall i am satisfied .
neutral	buoni i prezzi .
neutral	buono il_servizio .
neutral	consegne lentissime , 00 giorni per ricevere 0 gomme sono tantissimi !!
neutral	!
neutral	compared to almost any other company when you pay extra for shipping you expect it to be shipped next working day i ordered on saturday i expected shipping on monday but no i had to wait_till tuesday if i had known that would be the case i would have gone with teh free shipping and still got it on the same day
neutral	0 aerosol cans in a bubble_wrap envelope 0 tin had a pressure mark due to poor packing so over all not fully happy with how things went
neutral	never got my purchase or refunded
neutral	not a bad_experience .
neutral	i thought the gui could look sharper .
neutral	at the end of the day they are selling printer_ink so you would think the web_page would be alive with colour - but done tastefully !
neutral	also , i have ordered before but i could not see where the order was listed in my account and what i had ordered before .
neutral	they could make it a simple one click to reorder the same product against the details of your printer held in your account details .
neutral	this would prevent the client having to seach the website again for their specific cartidge type .
neutral	the account could list the printer you have and provide direct suggestions of cartridges with quality options and quantities .
neutral	finally i want to benefit from economies of scale but the options for colour packages is limited and now i seem to have heaps of black left .
neutral	today many home users print photos and their children are doing colourful projects for school - this means the colour ink is heavily used !
neutral	maybe you should offer the option to build a package of colours needed in quantities of 0 , 00 00 etc .
neutral	so if i wanted to order 0 cyan , 0 magenta , 0 yellow and a black ( qty 00 ) i could make a economies of scale saving !
neutral	sorry for the long reply .
neutral	i suppose once i got going i couldn_'_t help the creative juices !!
neutral	all the best mate .
neutral	the service in and of itself is awesome ...
neutral	i can '_t thank_you guys enough for taking hours out of my work schedule by offering an affordable transcription service .
neutral	the turn_around time was aslo absolutely impressive ... less_than 00_hours !
neutral	however ...
neutral	i ended_up paying for the " verbatim " add - on service ... and what i got was definitely not verbatim from my video_clips .
neutral	and it wasn_'_t that the video was not clear .
neutral	most of the speakers in the video were mic ' ed up .
neutral	and regardless , all of them were perfectly audible .
neutral	judging from the quality of this order , i realized that this service might actually be using a program to process the transcript ... even_though they advertise " human transcribing ".
neutral	so all in all , great service with a few blips here and there in the wording , which may or may not be due to a bit of false_advertising ....
neutral	not a big_deal since i '_m going in and revising the scripts , but i definitely won_'_t be paying for the verbatim service again .
neutral	to be honest , i kinda feel_cheated in that regard .
neutral	need to check the actual size of the unit if you say that it is 0x00 it should be a 0x00 .
neutral	the unit i have is 0ft 0in by 0ft so i had to do some work to make it fit
neutral	web_site was hopelessly slow but products are good and our one experience of shopping at the york shop was very good .
neutral	i have made two prescription sunglass orders and i was ultimately very happy with both , but , both came with the wrong prescription in one eye .
neutral	customer service was good at fixing both ( ship back the glasses , enclose instructions on what i actually wanted , wait for the repaired glasses ).
neutral	so i '_m happy now , but the path could have been easier .
neutral	the insurance_cover offered is good but there are problems when you go to medical screening , where they don_'_t seem to know what they ' re doing .
neutral	having spoken to them , the first email confirmed cover for everything but didn_'_t mention the last condition told to them .
neutral	my wife phoned again and was told everything was covered at no extra_cost until she mentioned the last item , which she considered minor .
neutral	suddenly she was told it would cost over £_000 to cover everything .
neutral	she asked to remove the last item but was told it was all or nothing .
neutral	she opted to remove all the conditions mentioned from the cover and it was agreed an_email would be sent confirming this but all that happened was that we were sent the same email as before , saying all the first items were covered at no extra_cost but there was no mention of the last one .
neutral	we don_'_t know if we ' re covered or not but can '_t face phoning them again .
neutral	in view of the way insurance companies try to avoid paying claims if all info hasn_'_t been given , i ' d say be very wary if you have anything medical to declare as the screening people don_'_t seem to know what they ' re doing .
neutral	very easy to order with a very quick delivery which was good .
neutral	however when the package arrived , it had no protection around it and was placed in an ordinary plastic courier envelope .
neutral	on arrival their was no damage to the envelope , but on opening , the box was broken and holed .
neutral	thankfully no damage to the goods .
neutral	it a little more attention to the packaging would have resulted_in a better rating .
neutral	the website is goo d but information is not always updated and real in some of the hotels that we have been too by booking through hotelworld . com
neutral	out hotel was excellent , the transfers were not as good as they could have been , but the big stress was caused_by ryanair '_s policy of not allocating seats at check - in .
neutral	as well as the usual stampede for seats , they had no process for reserving seats for disabled passengers .
neutral	this resulted_in a free for all and a disabled person in a wheelchair arriving last on the plane , having no allocated seat , and being dumped on the aisle seat , next to my wife and i , meaning that we could not leave our seats for four and a half hours !
neutral	broadway travel also omitted to tell us that we could have paid more for extra luggage weight , but only at booking .
neutral	we will not travel with ryanair ever again until they allocate seats .
neutral	y ' all shipped on time and you have a good website just need to say if .
neutral	it is for lite duty or heavy_duty
neutral	dear friends ,
neutral	i have been in this region in july_0000 on a motocycle - tour with friends in july_0000 and with my son rick in 0000 as well , and many more times with cruise ships in ullapool .
neutral	we love your country .
neutral	i had expected , you send me some sort of membership - card , is this not foreseen ?
neutral	kind_regards ,
neutral	michael schaake
neutral	not happy with the price increase as had to go else where now .
neutral	could do with a larger amount of the hurricane evo .
neutral	also would be good if u had a creatine , g - glutamine , tuarine and beta - alanin all in one miss that you could add to ur whey
neutral	waited in an empty house for a delivery that didn_'_t arrive till 0000 at which time it was too dark to check the goods .
neutral	when we did , the shower_tray and the shower surround were different_sizes and it has cost us £_00 to send this back .
neutral	be aware some couriers will not deliver to better_bathrooms .
neutral	this works as long as there are no_problems then it becomes complicated and costly .
neutral	£_00 . 00 in mobile_phone bills to date .
neutral	why if i have an open account with you do i need to pay with a credit_card for overseas shipments ?
neutral	the meet &_greet was excellent & we would recommend it , however we were disappointed to pick our car up dented & even more cross at being told it was already there !!!
neutral	until a helpful assistant remembered our car being hit by a coleague , and then the matter was dealt_with & our car repaired , so all ended well in the end !!
neutral	!
neutral	to hold up my order for one small part ( capacitor ) when the others were needed today on december_00th is unacceptalbe .
neutral	not an_email or phone_call to let_me know is yet another matter .
neutral	over sight for another reason given is such a poor one when the agian other parts were needed for projects to be completed today !
neutral	lead time was reasonable fot that order and to wait with personal on the clock cost me hours of labor .
neutral	again unacceptable !
neutral	!
neutral	the costumer telephone_number listed when you call never answers the phone .
neutral	it just keep on playing music .
neutral	a man they send you so much stuff that you an '_t keep_up .
neutral	the filtering and ability search thru credit_report not available .
neutral	the services take_forever to activate and monitor my credit_reports .
neutral	currently i have been a member for several months and still only transunion is showing the only credit_report being monitored .
neutral	i am seriously_considering going to another credit monitor service .
neutral	good place to get glasses but i had trouble getting a pair without defects .
neutral	good prices but items hard to find
neutral	rigtig hurtig_levering på bestilte varer .
neutral	fik dog fejllevering af halvdelen af ordren , hvilket ikke_er ok .
neutral	men god service i forbindelse_med henvendelsen omkring de fejlleverede varer .
neutral	dog kun 0 *, da den vigtigste ting ved nethandel er , at alt skal_være som bestilt .
neutral	ellers ryger fidusen ved det .
neutral	i was very pleased with the service and quality of the parts ordered but you double shipped and double_billed on the order .
neutral	i really have no use for the extra parts as i am an individual who ordered the parts for a relative .
neutral	flowers were nice and fresh but not worth the price i paid for could of come with a token gift bag or vase
neutral	i liked the price of the stuff i bought but im still_waiting for it to appear at my door
neutral	the order was despatched quickly .
neutral	the one product was a tennis bag which was a christmas_present .
neutral	on opening the one zip broke and so needed to return so incurred the additional postage .
neutral	the replacement was however sent quickly
neutral	everything fine until i opened the package and saw " taiwan " on the front of the dust cover .
neutral	not exactly_what i wanted for the stock restoration of my 0000_dodge super bee .
neutral	i relooked at the picture on line and it has a " m " on the front not taiwan .
neutral	details matter .
neutral	as i continue my restoration i will keep this in mind .
neutral	a good service but i missed a dicount code by booking to early
neutral	the prices are great but shipping an be costly .
neutral	i ordered a few parts and if the parts are on different location , you will be charge separate shipping charge for each location .
neutral	i ordered wheel trim for a 0000_chevy pickup got trim that fit a 00 - 0000 so we sent it back an reordered a different style , will see this week what we get
neutral	excellent selection , great prices , fast service .
neutral	what more could one want ?
neutral	well , uh , i receive about 00 oldies . com catalogs in the mail annually .
neutral	that '_s about 00 times more than i want or need .
neutral	most of them go straight to the recycling facility without ever being looked at .
neutral	i do enjoy the catalogs , but i don_'_t have time to look at more than one every few_months .
neutral	and the catalogs are large and bulky ; disposing of them is a major household chore that has_become a major pain .
neutral	it '_s hard to judge the true sizes because your items seem to be smaller than other clothes companies
neutral	with no verification by e_-_mail ( or order # to refer to ) i had to find a vendor i could contact directly to make_sure the part would arrive .
neutral	i ' d tried several_times ( phone and e_-_mail ) but never got any reply and had to assume the order was not coming .
neutral	the order eventually arrived but after already installing the needed part that arrived in 0 days .
neutral	the part you sent was in good condition but too_late to use as needed .
neutral	hope this helps for future orders .
neutral	review comes after i receive my item promptly and in brand_new , excellent condition
neutral	where is my receipt ?
neutral	confirmation ?
neutral	will you email me a tracking_number ?
neutral	i ordered a rear_window wiper_motor for our van from parts_geek , who sourced and shipped it quickly at an attractive pricey ; that part of the transaction was great .
neutral	however , the wiper_motor did not work at all ; they shipped me a defective_part ; i ended_up having to buy a much more_expensive one locally .
neutral	parts_geek quickly determined they ' d allow a return for a full_refund , which i appreciate .
neutral	but to have to pay the shipping again for the return of a part that was defective to start with is not right ; if it '_s not the customer '_s fault , then why should the customer bear the financial burden of parts_geek '_s error ?
neutral	the whole_ordeal ended_up costing me a lot of money : double for shipping , and more money , wasted time , and gas to locally source the part i needed instead of being_able to get one from parts_geek that should have worked right the first time ... but didn_'_t .
neutral	i like delivery . com but the most frustrating part is that you do not quote a delivery window when confirming an order .
neutral	other_sites do , i . e .
neutral	seamless who even texts you when the order is received and when it goes out for delivery .
neutral	i like the occasional discounts you offer which most often is what motivates me to use your site .
neutral	the selection of restaurants is 0_stars too .
neutral	they ' re not bad but not enough in all categories .
neutral	ziprecruiter started out great for about a year , but now at zip has_grown i don_'_t get the same volume i once did .
neutral	i also don_'_t have any luck with getting ads up on craigslist through zip .
neutral	the part works good so_far , but the box it came in was damaged with 0 hole in it .
neutral	the motor threaded screws 0 of 0 were stripped and would not thread on easy .
neutral	well i was able to make them work .
neutral	....................
neutral	thanks
neutral	zo ben_ik zeer_tevreden maar er is een foutje ontdekt het moest privé zijn en er staat prille
neutral	as long as you do not need to speak to a real_person , you will like the program .
neutral	but if you are technologically challenged like me and need to contact someone to walk you thru a problem , good luck .
neutral	i tried for 0_weeks to reach someone and finally gave up after constantly being guided to a " written " solution which_meant absolutely nothing to me .
neutral	the cost of shipping would stop me buying goods from lanson again .
neutral	i don_'_t need to pay $_00 to have goods delivered in 0 days , i '_m happy to wait 0_weeks & only pay $_00 .
neutral	the runners are excellent , however , by the time you add shipping i '_m not sure i can justify the extra_cost again .
neutral	upon_contacting the rental check - in , they had my paperwork and reservation available .
neutral	there was evidentally an upgrade available for my vehicle which sounded_like a decent deal so i took it .
neutral	i then got flooded with paperwork , charges , insurance , and fees not to mention getting precharged for them to fill the gas_tank upon return .
neutral	i asked what it was all about and she showed me the paperwork which was ver hard to understand as she pointed_out areas that would get refunded upon return split into several categories as well as charges split into numerous categories as well .
neutral	all this on top of pre paying online and then trying to figure_out price conversions from us to pounds on the spot .
neutral	this is really my only major complaint as the vehicle itself was nice , clean , and drove well .
neutral	i could say that she seemed helpful but i did not appreciate getting blindsided with all these extras when i had already booked and paid online .
neutral	check in upon return was quick and easy but they took my only paperwork with the breakdown of charges so now i need to request another reciept .
neutral	balloon side on top had with scratched glasses , it didn_'_t be allowed to make pictures
neutral	i called on phone & left a voicemail .
neutral	i also sent an e_-_mail with no response from either .
neutral	i think you need to send an automatic confirmation when sale is completed .
neutral	really good price for my old phone however took nearly 00 days to be updated to it had been received when tracking has shown it was there in 0
neutral	i normally purchase from decorate now , they did not stock the paint i required so put me in touch with yourselves - not sure if all the same company or not .
neutral	very helpful guy on phone and item in stock and dispatched .
neutral	the other company offer discount and free_postage which was not the case with my purchase here so slightly disappointed .
neutral	unfortunately the paint took well over a week to arrive as the courier could not find us !
neutral	would have been quicker to order locally .
neutral	this has soured my opinion unfortunately .
neutral	not sure i would rush to order again .
neutral	i ordered tennis_balls from the website , but product sent was not those represented graphically on the website .
neutral	i don_'_t know enough about tennis_balls , so i kept these as they seem ok and matched the qty ordered .
neutral	no note was included to say a sub had been made .
neutral	great product at a good price but let_down badly on delivery , suposed to be next_day . took 0 days .
neutral	iti was satisfied overall , i found your staff to be very helpful .
neutral	i think with so much revenue being generated the surface should be tarmacked .
neutral	also more signage should be available to make people aware to write down the bay number .
neutral	it was my first time to use the facility and i will use it again but signage and a proper base would give a far more professional image
neutral	i just purchased some kyb_shocks and struts for my g0 .
neutral	they arrived and i opened them only to find that the shocks didn_'_t come with the top post bushings .
neutral	i went back to the description and it didn_'_t picture the bushings but who really doesn_'_t expect new bushing to be included .
neutral	the guy at the gas_station who helped_us when we picked_up the car was very helpful and provided excellent customer service .
neutral	very nice guy .
neutral	the young_lady in tours near the train_station was very rude and was not at all helpful .
neutral	we did not know where to park the car and she was going to have us block some cars in .
neutral	she finally game out of her office and showed us a place that made sense .
neutral	why she was so rude we have no_idea , but she made the drop - off very unpleasant .
neutral	we no_longer have a good feeling about auto_europe us .
neutral	thanks for asking !
neutral	john lane
neutral	sub_par customer service dept - hard to reach ; no toll_free number or direct way to contact , to talk with a real_person .
neutral	product ordered was incorrectly listed on the website ; hasn_'_t been a very positive_experience on my first time order with company .
neutral	still_waiting for a return merchandise authorization ...
neutral	ok but was promised on their site that real tickets where issued in the post instead go ez tickets via_email , ok but when you are waiting on the post 0 days before you go and receive nothing then check emails and they are there in a dowload file to print , not the best of tickets printed on a0 paper and having to carry it round not good if it get wet , real tickets are easier to keep dry
neutral	otherwise i have no_complaints over the price
neutral	the parts i ordered arrived quickly .
neutral	the prices were very good but one of the parts which was a windshield_wiper fluid reservoir did not match the original and could not be installed correctly due to space limitations and miss alignment of mounting bolt_holes .
neutral	parts_geek did promptly respond to the issue and and sent a rma_number but because the shipping cost to return the part is a large percentage of the cost of the part , it was not worth it for me to return it .
neutral	they were quick with delivery but the screw on top to the bottles of toner were far too large and should be replaced with ones that actually fit_properly into the toner_cartridge .
neutral	the idea of making a paper funnel to try and pour the toner through is messy and could be solved by suppling the correct top to the toner bottle .
neutral	as i shopped your add shoed free shipping and then at the checkout it is some dumb monthly charge by signing_up for it .
neutral	t he products took n0 days too complete and the radiator itself was 0 days from the date of order ?
neutral	not too happy and probably wont order again .
neutral	where are my parts .
neutral	ordered parts on 00 / 00 / 0000 , haven_'_t received parts as of 00 / 00 / 0000 .
neutral	may i suggest finding another shipper that is reliable ...
neutral	can '_t give a review , i don_'_t have the part .
neutral	i complained about the broken footswich for my amp over a week_ago , and still_havent received the replacement .
neutral	however i have been very pleased with your service previously , i hope the footswich arrives soon .
neutral	after installing the new ink_cartridges i printed about 00 0x0 pictures .
neutral	the first 0 were good , by the end they were printing so light i had to stop .
neutral	for me , not worth the low price if you have to buy twice as much .
neutral	i would like to sent the calipers cores back so i can callect my cores deposit .
neutral	i need a rma_# to be able to do this but i dont have it .
neutral	can you help me in this matter by contacting parts zeek to send me a rma_# by e / mail .
neutral	the parts #_000000 and 000000 for calipers but no rms # for returns ove cores .
neutral	thank_you .

neutral	after browsing the net - amazon and amazon ads - contacted david_shuttle , who are running a 00_% on riedel tumblers we were seeking .
neutral	the website was ok not brilliant - but life is too short to have two cards rejected one mastercard and one debit_card visa .
neutral	i would have not filled up - but responded to an_email with a satisfactory phone_call - no_problems with the card - delivery and packing good .
neutral	i haven_'_t had the opportunity to use the product as it just came today , ( why do they have people rate something before can even try it ), so my rating is held to three pending use of the product and my being_able to evaluate it
neutral	i am not impressed with the quality .
neutral	i will buy glasses for my wife soon but not sure who from .

neutral	arrived at_gatwick having phoned ahead and no_problems with the drop_off .
neutral	on our return , we called after we collected the bags and was told 00_minutes .
neutral	as it was nearly 00 : 00 we waited in the terminal for a short while before making our way to the pick_up point .
neutral	waited nearly_half an_hour with a cold and tired 0 year_old child , phoned again and was told 0 or 0 minutes , car eventually arrived in a further 0 minutes .
neutral	wouldnt recommend , there are plenty other_companies who offer this service .
neutral	jim
neutral	pureformulas has a solid product selection - i can always find what i '_m looking for .
neutral	however , customer service is less_than i ' d expect .
neutral	i had accidentally placed a duplicate order of a product so had to return it .
neutral	in order to get the return_label from pureformulas , i had to call and email about 0 times - each time they said it would be emailed to me but wasn_'_t .
neutral	if they can fix the customer service glitches like this , they ' d be my go - to supplement site .
neutral	for now , i only purchase from them if they have the best price .
neutral	i had posted an awful review - but since that i have heard from remotecontrol express - and my opinion of them has improved .
neutral	i have found some good music for short promotional videos here at great prices .
neutral	that being said , you have to wade_through a lot of junk to find good music .
neutral	there doesn_'_t seem to be any vetting of the music posted , nor of the keywords associated with the tracks .
neutral	these factors , combined with lackluster search functionality , makes the site frustrating to use .
neutral	i '_ve ordered lots of parts from parts_geek and most of the time they have the best prices and good parts .
neutral	the only draw_back ; they have the worst customer service - it appears they don_'_t even want to help you let_alone talk with you , no knowledge of the parts !
neutral	also , shipping is slow !
neutral	the best way to rate them is to understand , " you get what you pay for ."
neutral	the don_'_t skimp on the quality of the part but you have to understand you will not get the best customer service & allow for plenty of time to receive the order .
neutral	great products & prices .
neutral	but ........ like i stated , b / o or items no_longer carried are just never sent and never followed_up on .
neutral	i think this may actually be looked upon as a type of ' misdemeanor ' in the business world or catalog shopping .
neutral	i may actually check with the bbb .
neutral	an example of this is my last order ( 000000 ).
neutral	a belinda carlisle / go - go '_s 00rpm box set was a part of my order .
neutral	i received my confirmation , shipping info , etc_., by never was i informed the product is not available .
neutral	and the invoices are misleading in what is on bo , na , or out of stock .
neutral	like i said , this was the second order in which something like this took place .
neutral	after ordering my evh striped series guitar with peach_guitars i was not sent an order confirmation / deposit receipt .
neutral	i had to keep calling to find out the status of my order , when there was a delay with shipping ( from manufacturer ) i was not immediately notified but found out as a result of me keep calling .
neutral	i emailed to find out a delivery date and reason for delay , to which i received no response .
neutral	the guitar arrived in good condition and quickly once it was in stock .
neutral	my protein used to be good .
neutral	i bought big orders from them every month .
neutral	quality supps at good prices .
neutral	then they hiked up the prices drastically .
neutral	so now i shop on line instead and have found better supplements at more affordable prices .
neutral	i still buy small_amounts off them but not much , because they didn_'_t look after me as a customer .
neutral	basically felt_like from the time my order was placed to the time the contacts were shipped was to long .
neutral	shipping time for first_class was long in and of itself - noted as my choice of shipment .
neutral	however time felt extended due to the time the contacts were finally shipped .
neutral	i could have purchased locally same price ( 000 contacts ) and received them in the same time at a local walmart .
neutral	most_likely won_'_t purchase here again .
neutral	expected more " efficient " processing .
neutral	my air_filter came and it was smashed !!!!
neutral	looked like it had been ran over by a semi about 00 times .
neutral	all other items o . k .
neutral	the initial response was great with fast , courteous , service .
neutral	you trapped and removed a skunk which returned six days_later .
neutral	i am not sure where you released the skunk .
neutral	it became clear that the whole objective was to sell me over $_00 , 000 worth of service .
neutral	i was not ready for that .
neutral	the fan i ordered the electrical_plug did not fit with the plug on my car .
neutral	i had to pay an extra 00 dollars to have it cut down to fit into the slot of the electrical_plug .
neutral	the reservation clerk was very friendly .
neutral	the extra day and drop_off charge was more than the original rental , can you spell ripoff .
neutral	the car was confusing and the lot attendent showed me how to set the nav system .
neutral	i had to stop at a citroen dealer to undeerstand the eco , since the car would shut_off at traffic lights .
neutral	the car would vibrate at 000 to 000 kph then settle down .
neutral	hello
neutral	delivery time was satisfactory , quality of product good , but as mentioned it developed a slow_leak .
neutral	difficult to spot that in advance .
neutral	it has_been 00 days and my package is still in illinois .
neutral	driving without a blinker is no fun .
neutral	software trial_period had expired when purchased so i could not use the software right_away .
neutral	i had to request the key code after waiting for e_-_mail for two_days .
neutral	booked flights , hotel , and taxi transfers with alpharooms and all went well .
neutral	decided subsequently to cancel the taxi transfers and booked a car instead .
neutral	this was no problem and for safety_reasons decided to take out the additional " total damage excess waiver " insurance at a cost of £_00 on top of the regular insurance .
neutral	to my surprise when i went to collect the car in portugal i was asked if i wanted the excess_insurance .
neutral	i replied that i had the tdew but was informed that this was irrelevent and unless i took out their excess_insurance at a cost of 000euros that i would be liable for an excess of up to 0000euros !
neutral	!
neutral	well that was a no_brainer , so the moral of the story is forget the total damage excess waiver insurance supplied by alpharooms and get it at resort .
neutral	i contacted alpharooms and unfortunately they didn_'_t want to know .
neutral	shame .
neutral	got shipment , took inventory and discovered that not only are the rear_struts different colors but the shock boots were made of a stiffer cheaper plastic material and did not fit well at all .
neutral	the strut_mount kits were also missing hardware .
neutral	kyb kit but it could have been a lot better .
neutral	i believe they owe me .
neutral	when i purchased something so expensive , expected much_better communication on when it would be delivered & how long it would take .
neutral	it took more than the 00 business days stated to arrive , and they kept giving me the wrong dates when i asked when it would ship .
neutral	this should have been much more transparent , and affected my proposal plans .
neutral	also , once the ring arrived , she tried it on it was far too big , took it to a local_jeweler and found out it was a full half size larger than i ordered .
neutral	value - wise , they can '_t be_beaten offline though , got the ring looked at by someone local and they valued it at nearly 00_% more than what i paid ( pre_- tax ).
neutral	however , i think some of their online competitors like bluenile offer similar prices .
neutral	this was my first dealing_with 0000rpm the service was good and the reponse time in replying and the prices was good but the only_thing that but the thing i have to faulty is that they sent the wrong items i ordered they sent the cheaper version which i really did not want but using it would cost more in sending them back than to order mor over all they just need to keep an eye one what is going out for stock control ( being a store keeper )
neutral	thx tony belisle
neutral	ordered goods next_day but only the filter from the funnel turned_up .
neutral	so had to wait an_additional day for the delivery of the complete funnel to turn up .
neutral	hopefully the additional delivery charge for next_day will be refunded .
neutral	customer service was great very quick to answer the phone and a got problem_solved quickly .
neutral	i would still use the company again due to after sales care .
neutral	good service except for two parts out of 00 parts .
neutral	received wrong part and another part arrived damaged .
neutral	so good for parts except body parts .
neutral	still_haven_'_t concluded parts returned on wrong part ( grill ).
neutral	i wanted to order a gift_card for my wife for christmas and she is living somewhere_else temporarily .
neutral	i tried to place the order to mail to her 0 times and it was denied all 0 times .
neutral	i finally ordered it and had it shipped to me , but because of that inconvenience , my wife didn_'_t get the gift in time for christmas .
neutral	very frustrating .
neutral	at the end of november i rented unit 000 at hillside .
neutral	the day after when i went to place my things into storage , my code did not work .
neutral	i had to wait_until the office opened to have my code reset .
neutral	i also signed the form for auto payment online , on december 0rd i received a phone_call saying that i did not pay my bill .
neutral	i had to call the manager at hillside .
neutral	i gave him my name but he was unable to find me .
neutral	after a couple of minutes he was able to find me based on my unit number .
neutral	i told the manager that i had filled_out the authorization for auto payment .
neutral	the manager found the form with my signature and was unable to tell me why i was not enrolled .
neutral	everything is " working " now .
neutral	this is the first time i have ever used a storage_unit and it was frustrating and stressful to have to deal with this especially being out of state on government work .
neutral	i initially ordered the wrong filter , probably my fault .
neutral	called and talked to lisa , who was very helpful .
neutral	she was ordering the correct size for me on order / invoice number 000000000 .
neutral	this was on 0 / 00 / 0000 .
neutral	i have never received a confirmation number or a shipping notice with tracking_number .
neutral	i obtained this invoice number from wendy woodard as she notified me of a small refund for a " delay on order , credit per lisa ".
neutral	this occurred on 0 / 00 / 0000 .
neutral	i sent wendy an_email a couple of days ago and received this request for feedback .
neutral	i need more communication from air_filters delivered .
neutral	two_weeks know and nothing .
neutral	please_let_me hear from someone .
neutral	thank_you .
neutral	i ordered three parts : 0 ) blinker switch 0 ) wiper switch 0 ) back up lamp switch ( mounted to transmission .)
neutral	the first two parts ( both made by a reputable parts company were perfect ) but the back up switch ( which was made by vemo ) was bad right out of the box .
neutral	going was fine , the man was there to collect car and all good .
neutral	coming home wasnt so good , we were delay in spain so i called ahead to explain we would be delayed for 0 hours and so not collecting car for about 0 hours time , the man on the phone very nice , said no_worries .... we landed and i phoned explained we were the delayed ones , ok , he told us where to go , we went after 00_minutes i phones again and i was asked if i had rung already i said yes and he said ok we will just get your car and be on our way , after another 00_minutes we had our car , this was about 0 . 00am by now everyone tired and it wasnt needed ...
neutral	this was my second purchase from kitbag .
neutral	i dared to order soccer shoes .
neutral	two_pairs in fact .
neutral	one pair you did not have despite it showed as in stock on the web .
neutral	the other pair was ordered size 00 . 0 us and arrived 00 . 0 us .
neutral	luckily , the socks i also ordered came as expected .
neutral	overall , i am not encouraged to keep ordering from your company because you ship without_any kind of tracking_information and - actually - it seems that you ship whatever you want as_opposed to what you make available on your website .
neutral	so , there you have it
neutral	i '_m very happy with the price , quality and speed of receiving parts but the customer service needs to be improved !
neutral	i asked a question of why i only received to tracking_numbers for items being shipped from 0 warehouses .
neutral	they never gave_me a answer to my question just a bunch of information that never gave_me any answer .
neutral	i will purchase parts from them again .
neutral	we had a big issue with our first experience with housetrip and our first booking .
neutral	the host tried to change the terms of our booking while were on route to the apartment and the day before we were due to check - in .
neutral	the host was terrible and the apartment was unacceptable and uninhabitable by any standard .
neutral	the air_conditioning and the hot_water did not work .
neutral	be aware that housetrip gives hosts sometimes up to 00_hours to fix issues , so you could be stuck in a substandard apartment for up to that long as we were .
neutral	we missed a very expensive precooked tour because we could not shower when we woke_up .
neutral	housetrip eventually managed to get us out of our booking , but not after we had to pay for the one night we had to suffer .
neutral	this seemed unfair .
neutral	to make_matters worse , we are unable to review this unprofessional host and property , even thought we paid for and stayed one night .
neutral	others need to be warned away from this property and host .
neutral	housetrip is not helping_us in that matter .
neutral	even_though we did have three other acceptable booking after that first bad_experience , i doubt that we will use housetrip again .
neutral	i received my part quickly .
neutral	the box was thin and ripped up when i received it .
neutral	the mirror inside was in some bag and no padding at all .
neutral	surprised that it didn_'_t break .
neutral	better packaging and we would be at a 0_star_rating .
neutral	public record reporting is poor ... no licenses .. no vehicles ...
neutral	dont ever answer emails ...!!!!!!!!
neutral	!
neutral	having now read other reviews .... i realise i '_m not alone by not having emails replied to and money being taken yet no delivery .
neutral	will be taking legal_action if i dont receive a response in the next 00_hours and will never buy again despite having spent £_000 '_s previously ....
neutral	then .... got an answer after posting the above review only to be fobbed_off for another month .
neutral	still got my money ..... still no goods ..... still no email reply or phone_call apology .
neutral	only one option left from here .....
neutral	after calling to check aviablity on a fluke 000 multimeter , i was advised in stock and to order online , only to find it was back orderd for a week , the day after i received the meter it went on sale as a internet special
neutral	fairly easy to use and book .
neutral	in the past when you experience a problem customer service is mediocre .
neutral	didn_'_t get very helpful or understanding people to talk to .
neutral	the supervisor i was finally passed through was a little better , but didn_'_t follow through with what she offered .
neutral	if i had an_alternative i would have switched to a different company .
neutral	i like that you are not just one airport .
neutral	there was nothing special about this purchase other than replacing
neutral	a part that was damaged on a friends truck .
neutral	the first company i made a reservation with called me to tell me they didn_'_t actually have any of the units i reserved .
neutral	they offered me half the space for basically the same price .
neutral	the second company was wonderful .
neutral	it would be great if spare_foot could keep track of unit availability and not reserve units that don_'_t exist .
neutral	dear friends the only_thing you have to work at is when a package does not get to the intended party you want us to submit a ticket it ’_s not only the wrong way to go at thing but it takes time and most of the time the site to submit the ticket is down you should have a call_center set_up from 0000 to like 0000 or so , so that your customers can talk to a person and not feel_like they are at a loss .
neutral	the products were good .
neutral	however it took a long time to process the order .
neutral	clubmed is usually quite on the ball , but they need all the details fed through to them correctly .
neutral	this did not happen so we had some issues during or holiday that we could have avoided .
neutral	bookbyte was fast , reliable , and inexpensive .
neutral	however the book i received did not come with a certain activation_code i needed for the class .
neutral	i had to by this code separately which cost about $_000_dollars .
neutral	good value , some hidden_charges .
neutral	porting number is inferred to be free , until you go to do it .
neutral	then there is a charge .
neutral	i have had various issues with the phone service and with the soft phone app that has never worked for me .
neutral	the problems range from call waiting issues to phone ringing once and then going to voice_mail and to one person suddenly not able to hear the other person .
neutral	also the voicemail response refers to a fax which i do not have and we have not been able to get_rid of it .
neutral	like i said it needs work -- i was much happier with google_voice and the obi !!
neutral	!
neutral	hope this torch doesn_'_t break as i have been waiting over a year for the postage refund on the other torch i had to return
neutral	selection , site , service ... everything very average .
neutral	lucky there is no competition .
neutral	i '_m not brandon daniels
neutral	i '_m scoring out of 00 would be 0 maximum due to the lack of communcation and assistance when trying to establish if flowers would be delivered .
neutral	i chose with standard delivery & ordered the flowers 0 days prior to delivery date .
neutral	as stated on web - site that on the day of delivery you would be given an e_-_mail with tracking_number for yodel delivery company this never happened .
neutral	i tried e_- mailing serenata several_times but no reply .
neutral	i then managed to get a phone_number for yodel which i duely called only to be told that the flowers had only just arrived at the depot ( 0000hrs ) & that due too_late delivery that the flowers would have to be delivered the following_day .
neutral	i explained the the flowers were due to be delivered at works address but was told that i needed to re - arrange with serenata - again no reply afetr e_- mailing .
neutral	i then called yodel again who then very nicely said that they will deliver asap .
neutral	overall flowers very nice , yodel delivery service were very helpful but all communctions with serenata_flowers were very poor & non_existent .
neutral	i feel that i had to do all the donkey work to ensure that flowers were delivered that day .
neutral	overall flowers 00 / 00 - yodel delivery 00 / 00 - serenataflowers communcations 0 / 00 .
neutral	i took the storage_units because the pricing was the cheapest i '_ve come_across but in comparison to space they were still sort of over priced .
neutral	the lockers are not 0 ' tall as the website had advertised but were well built any way with metal grates across the inside .
neutral	i would suggest having smooth surfaces for the inside as apposed to the corrugated metal .
neutral	the extra fees concern me and to require insurance when the place is already somewhat expensive and has arguable more than enough security for itself is overkill .
neutral	key delivery should have been instant , instead i received key 00h later .
neutral	company made a mistake by telling that keys are in stock .
neutral	that '_s not professional .
neutral	on the other hand , they have great prices .
neutral	i '_ll definitely give them a second chance !
neutral	good service initially .
neutral	second time round , had two items rejected - one apparently incomplete ( which is utter nonsense , the set was fully_intact and coincidentally was the most expensive item ) and another had ' wrong barcode '.
neutral	the second item begs the question that if it had the wrong barcode , why did the musicmagpie system recognise it and list it correctly ?
neutral	doh !
neutral	probably will not use again .
neutral	i entered an order on thursday .
neutral	i checked daily after that for a tracking order .
neutral	i finally got it on the next tuesday - the same day that i received the item .
neutral	i had a pleasant stay last time at days inn .
neutral	the online reservations are fairly easy although the web_site is a little_slow but overall the service is good and the rooms are comfortable .
neutral	string of solar_lights for the garden are brilliant , but please , please , please find a new delivery company ...
neutral	... i left a note with my order to leave the delivery in the garage if we were out .
neutral	we were and they took it away .
neutral	royal_mail are brilliant , if you are not in they leave the parcel at the local post_office .
neutral	almost every time i have used this site to order food for lunch meeting the food has arrived late .
neutral	apparently your system is such that the order does not get to the vendor until 00 - 00 min before the order is scheduled .
neutral	i am not sure if this is by design or if your system takes a lot of time to process the orders .
neutral	if it is the later than maybe you should not allow same day orders if they are over a certain_amount of items .
neutral	other than that , the orders have always been correct and everything else has worked well .
neutral	fix the lateness issue and you have one fine service .
neutral	the product is good and easy to assemble i would certainly recommend it .
neutral	it took a long time for it to be delivered and i got an_email_saying it was going to be delivered three_days after it had already been delivered so that was a little unhelpful .
neutral	great price , quick shipment , however , not all items were received together even_though order status said they were shipped .
neutral	had to contact customer service .
neutral	no option to speak to customer service on phone only via_email .
neutral	had to wait for customer service to contact me which took a business day .
neutral	i use priceline in order to attempt to bid prices at hotels , and on rental_cars .
neutral	i was able to get a loaded mid - size fuel efficient gmc suv for $_00 a day on priceline .
neutral	the only_thing i don_'_t like is that sometimes the descriptions provided by the hotels and reviews by readers is not accurate .
neutral	on a july_0000 trip the hotel claimed free parking , but the parking was on the street parking which would have been more accurate in new_orleans .
neutral	.
neutral	.
neutral	fortunately my stay was during the week and off - season thus being handicapped it would have been a challenge .
neutral	you cannot get a refund when you bid and the vendor accepts .
neutral	i have saved on airline flights on priceline .
neutral	so the best advice is to either stay in 0 - 0_star hotels or pick an area that has only one hotel of the star level you want , by reviewing hotel websites so that you don_'_t get ripped_off .
neutral	overall priceline is an amazing tool that is only as good as the user .
neutral	the prices are the best , why i go through them .
neutral	but i did get hit with fraud on both my credit_cards in feb 00 for over 0 grand in fraud charges on each .
neutral	my bank reimbursed the money after a month , it was proven something happened from their site , don_' know if someone sold peoples information or what , happened to a boat_load of people at the same time .
neutral	fast forward to now and everything has_been ok so_far , but what bugged me about that before was trying to get a hold of someone .
neutral	no one answered emails or phone_calls , was a pain .
neutral	my apt was scheduled for 00 am yet my car didn_'_t go in for the work until 00 : 00 am .
neutral	i was told that the work would be completed in an_hour but the car was not ready until 00 : 00 .
neutral	i also had to ask for a receipt and there was a charge on the bill that wasn_'_t explained to me .
neutral	lastly , the wheel locks were to be removed and replaced with new lug_nuts , when i went out to the car i noticed that the wheel locks weren_'_t removed .
neutral	you fell short today and i have to reconsider whether or not to do future business with you .
neutral	when we saw the led light collar tags it sounded_like the perfect solution for seeing our dogs at night in the yard , especially the one who does not want to come in , and has to be hunted down with a flashlight every night to get him to come inside .
neutral	and the light does work perfectly for that , if you can get it to go on before you let the dog out .
neutral	unfortunately , you can press and press and press the button , and it is about a 00 - 00 shot that the light will respond to your touch !
neutral	petflow '_s ads for the tag gave the impression that if it is dark , and your dog is wearing the collar with the tag , then it would light up , and that is just not the case .
neutral	it is an effort , too much in our opinion , to put the light on , before the dog does out in the dark !
neutral	so , we bought three , but only turn it on the collar of the one dog who is hardest to locate in the dark .
neutral	the other thing that was not mentioned in the promotion of this product is that the dogs do not like wearing a light around their collar .
neutral	all three of our dogs have tried to get it off when we turn on the light !
neutral	you get what you pay for and the download speed isn_'_t too bad , but long wait for the transaction to clear before they will give you a key to access to game you '_ve bought is extremely irritating .
neutral	i wouldn_'_t use them again unless ( like with pro evo 0000 ) there were no other choice .
neutral	i chose this company on google because of free shipping it said .
neutral	this is and was deceiving .
neutral	the product was correct but disappointing to find out the free shipping is false .
neutral	i felt_like i found a flight and a rental_car for a reasonable price .
neutral	i upgraded the car one step and feel_like i received a fair deal .
neutral	it seems that '_s as it should be .
neutral	however , the website has a feature where you can pick out your seat assignment and i did ; the airline e_- mailed my confirmation that i could pick my seat assignment at the time of the flight .
neutral	which one is correct ?
neutral	did the initial deal on a sunday and went well , all nice and easy .
neutral	asked for all items to be delivered in one go as some items not in stock .
neutral	one lot came and then other item delivery dates were in accurate .
neutral	phone options when you call irritating as usual and time hanging on .
neutral	they don_'_t realise that shipping out many bits means i have to make arrangements to be at home to accept , i work away a lot .
neutral	why can '_t people just do what you ask them to do as do users .
neutral	talk to people rather_than e_mails and computers !!!!!!
neutral	!
neutral	i am not experienced at ordering plants threw the mail / i did expect
neutral	0 hearty looking plants .
neutral	maybe the 0 sick looking ones will still grow ?
neutral	the jury is still out .
neutral	while i appreciate it was an extended holiday , it came as a surprise to be asked for my view before the item had arrived .
neutral	the item appeared today ( friday 0 june ) and so_far so good .
neutral	easy to assemble the golf_trolley and clear_instructions attached .
neutral	a pity that citylink failed to leave a card when they attempted delivery on thursday afternnon .
neutral	it would have prevented a couple of phone_calls on friday_morning .
neutral	could the use of technology not be exended to informing the customer when delivery ( within 0 hours ) will take place ?
neutral	just a thought .
neutral	i like the products although they are too expensive in most_cases and i '_m rich .
neutral	i like some of the shirts and i think others are dumb but i applaud them for going out on a limb to make some creative looking shirts and kettle_bells .
neutral	aubrey kisses joe_rogan '_s ass way too much , yeah he '_s a cool guy but shit man chill out .
neutral	also , try to be nicer on the phone , you guys think you ' re way cooler than you are you dorks .
neutral	also , your website needs some bugs fixed on the shopping_cart and checkout_process .
neutral	try testing it out some time , you '_ve got problems with your sessions ( if you even know what " sessions " are you geniuses ).
neutral	i have bought from go0arena before and they have decent prices and quick speed .
neutral	however my last transaction had a hiccup and i have still yet to receive my money back .
neutral	overall , i would buy from them again but i wish they could issue refunds quicker especially when they have admitted the fault was on their side .
neutral	when i arrived at reagan national , and as i was exiiting the building , i called the holiday_inn and talked to whoever they transferred me to in charge of the shuttle .
neutral	this happend to be mid - afternoon .
neutral	i gave my name and where i was waiting ( at the hotel courtesy bus hut ).
neutral	we waited for a half_hour to be picked_up , but no one showed_up from the holiday_inn .
neutral	a second call to the hotel was then made and 00_minutes later the shuttle appeared .
neutral	the driver said he had come by earlier and missed us .
neutral	this was impossible due to the fact that we never left the hut and faced every shuttle that drove through the circle .
neutral	a 00 minute wait for a transport stationed 0 minutes away is unacceptable .
neutral	have flown with ryanair a few_times while going abroad .
neutral	departed on time , landed on time and are the cheapest amongst other airlines .
neutral	although , the staff didn_'_t come_across as too friendly , they could have smiled once or twice .
neutral	the landings are a bit heavy too , feels_like the pilot has to get get out of the sky and land before he is fired .
neutral	0_stars .
neutral	i am not confident that the " flush " maximizes the taste potential of each capsule i . e .
neutral	is the container punctured to the point that all the coffee is optimally bled from the capsule ?
neutral	the only_thing is that is really dificult with the aproving of the order if you already had an approve order the rest shoud be easy .
neutral	it is really difficult to get another aprrove or
neutral	being_able to go to the site and find exactly_what my company needs was great .
neutral	i however did not appreciate the experience of calling the counter to get help with extending the stay .
neutral	everything fine your end not very impressed with
neutral	the rent company in new_york fobbed_off with larger 0x0 than we ordered their excuse was that our vehicle was blocked in so we ended_up with a real gas guzzler .
neutral	on returning the vehicle we noticed they had invoiced us for a full_tank of fuel which in fact was virtually empty . fortunately i had kept my fuel receipt for my first tankful in new_york one mile away from pickup point so they credited my card .
neutral	this transaction was in september_0000 so a shade late asking my opinion
neutral	i did contact you on my return but was told you have no control with u . s renter .
neutral	d b
neutral	die bedienung ist_sehr_einfach_und intuitiv , das bezahlen klappt problemlos und sicher .
neutral	die gebühren finde_ich persönlich zu hoch angesetzt , denn über andere anbieter wie banken , prelado . de , etc .
neutral	bieten diesen dienst sogar kostenlos an .
neutral	my booking process went quite smooth with austi europe .
neutral	all except for the winter tire daily fee .
neutral	the auto_europe guy on the phone mentioned it but as if was a one time fee .
neutral	otherwise it was a good process and quite satisfied .
neutral	having used comms_express a number of times the service , products and pricing are very good .
neutral	two negatives for me though 0 : if you order the wrong part / product a 00_% restocking_charge applies which is very expensive .
neutral	they also charge a " wasted_journey fee " as well as a " collection charge " this totals £_00 on top of the 00_% restocking_charge for the items we purchased .
neutral	so to return one item im facing 0 fees .
neutral	from a customer service point of view this needs reviewing badly .
neutral	the second negative is the wording of " wasted_journey fee ", just comes across as very negative and almost an element of blame attached to it .
neutral	would i use comms_express again ?
neutral	more than likely but i would triple_check that you order the right equipment as you will be left with a " bad_taste in the mouth " as we were .
neutral	i really like the parts and prices your have .
neutral	but the service is terrable .
neutral	i dont have access to a computer very much , and tried to call parts_geek and order .
neutral	but all i ever got was music and nobody ever answered my call .
neutral	i was on the phone for over 00_minutes waiting , not happy .
neutral	i also took a long time for my parts to get here , in wyoming .
neutral	thanks roger
neutral	i ordered new service and they had me set_up with my appt in 0 days time .
neutral	this was a great turnaround time to me .
neutral	when the tech came out to install it he said the fiber was cut somewhere so another team had to come out and repair it .
neutral	then he said i would be contacted with a new appt time to install it .
neutral	there was no word on the repair date but i saw 0 at & t vans for 0 days in a row so i thought they were repairing it .
neutral	a couple of days_later i got an e_-_mail saying my new appt was 00 days down the road .
neutral	i called up right_away because there was no way i was going to wait that long .
neutral	( i would have went with cox if i did have to wait that long but i didn_'_t say that when talking to customer service .)
neutral	customer service was helpful by calling my local install center and got me with an install date for 0 days_later .
neutral	i was wondering_why they didn_'_t check with them to begin with .
neutral	anyway the tech came out and installed everything and it is great so_far .
neutral	after it was installed on 0 separate days repair men came to the house to fix my line and to bury the new line .
neutral	i wasn_'_t sure what they were talking_about because i already had service so it didn_'_t seem like communication was flowing from place to place .
neutral	all in all , it was worth it and i am enjoying my service .
neutral	product and prices were great however , the shipper did not write down my apartment number so my product was shipped to a different address .
neutral	shipper needs to write down all of customers address info for 0 stats .
neutral	i will give them one more chance
neutral	i noticed that my cat_food had no expiration_date also when i recieved food it was in crumbs .. also can food was to expire soon
neutral	shipping took way to long , took 0 days .
neutral	my dog_loves her food though .
neutral	my order was generated through a bounty . com flash sale and meant that i could purchase a change mat cheaper_than any where else i have seen .
neutral	order arrived in very good time and was well_packaged .
neutral	i have ordered the book and was told it would take 0 - 0 business days this is day 00 and i have not received the books yet .
neutral	they were also shipped separately making it a little more difficult tracking the separate books .
neutral	the condition of the books were good .
neutral	and i received the books requested .
neutral	we had to sit in the parking_lot for two plus hours to get our car .
neutral	this is unforgivable .
neutral	the car was great and the people we dealt_with we ' re first rate but that wait !
neutral	as a small_niggle , i wish someone knew how to enable the aux audio in the soda we rented .
neutral	website dates imputed kept reverting to current date even_though correct dates shown before pressing button to pay .
neutral	after paying page and on - line receipt both show incorrect dates .
neutral	just for your information as all sorted_out by phone !
neutral	after looking at different voip providers we were recommended telapliant and spoke to the sales_person_who was very helpful , well informed and fairly quick getting back with required information .
neutral	because we had not set_up voip before it was important we were given detailed_information about what we required .
neutral	on the whole this was the case , although we weren_'_t informed that we have to plug the phones directly into the modem rather then the individual computers themselves , which_meant we had to purchase additional extra long cables .
neutral	also , once the phones we ordered arrived , the instructions on how to set them up were poor and didn_'_t cover the model of phone we ordered .
neutral	because of this we spent many wasted hours on the phone to support who , despite_being friendly and helpful , didn_'_t manage to resolve all our set_up problems .
neutral	eventually however we did manage to set_up the majority of the phone lines .
neutral	these setup instructions should have been available to follow in the set_up manual or even better , there should have been a set_up manager to complete the set_up for us .
neutral	one of the phones we were sent didn_'_t work so we tried a number of different things to test it .
neutral	these didn_'_t work so we are in the process of getting a new phone sent which is also proving painful .
neutral	i '_m hopeful the service will be good once all the phones are set_up but for a small operation like ours it should have taken a matter of hours to set_up and it '_s now been weeks and many wasted hours on the phone and we ' re still not fully_operational , so i can '_t yet say .
neutral	regarding the quality of the calls , for the phones that work it '_s so_far been very good and there are no_issues with the phones we have set_up .
neutral	the options to customise are good and the management dashboard is well_laid_out and easy to use .
neutral	it '_s just a shame we aren_'_t yet able to get it fully_operational .
neutral	i think these issues are easily remedied and just require better information in the set_up collateral and pro - active set_up support at the start .
neutral	i bought 0 pair of dress pants .
neutral	one fits great and i wear them regularly , the other is 0 inches too small in the waist , though it is marked as i ordered it .
neutral	i can '_t return it because i ordered it tailored to length .
neutral	i reserved this unit online and then relieved a call from a sales agent letting_me know their hours of operation the next_day , so that i could finalize my reservation .
neutral	when i arrived at 00 : 00_pm ( business hours are between 000am - 000pm m - f ) there was no one even there .
neutral	what a joke .
neutral	i '_m taking my business to someone_who has time for their customers .
neutral	very very high shipping cost , however prices are actually low .
neutral	i '_ve bought a few items of ski gear from them recently , including 0 pairs of new skis .
neutral	everything was perfect , except they totally messed_up on the binding settings for one pair of skis - got both the boot sole length and din settings totally wrong despite their written notes being correct .
neutral	they claim to have a 0 stage quality control procedure , which was obviously not effective in my case .
neutral	luckily for me this particular binding was very simple to re - adjust to the correct length , but could have been a disaster on other binding systems .
neutral	on the plus side they do supply all their skis fully hot - waxed and ready to go ( once you '_ve sorted_out your binding settings !).
neutral	end of season sale prices were very competitive too .
neutral	in summary i ' d certainly recommend them , but i dropped a couple of stars for the major error on binding settings - which is critical when buying new skis .
neutral	whats happened to the free sweets are you feeling the recession lol
neutral	great line of equipment .
neutral	pain in the assignment to order and log in without numerous hiccups .
neutral	magazine mmm is the best of its kind .
neutral	when we have used you before all your drivers have been very courteous and help load and unload luggage from car .
neutral	this yime the return driver offerred no such help and stood back waiting for me to load the 0 bags myself .
neutral	as i am not in the first flush of youth and the other people were ladies a little help would have been appreciated
neutral	purchased a 0000_lexus rx000 engine under cover .
neutral	it seemed to be thinner than the original and the mounting_holes had to be reemed out a little bigger to be able to mount the part .
neutral	guess you get what you pay for in this world .
neutral	too much_trouble to complain_about it , ship it back and then get a refund .
neutral	only bad thing is that i didn_'_t get my stuff delivered i had to pick_up the courier service was terrible would use again but hope that they can use someone_else for delivery
neutral	room was fine , although the bathroom door looked like someone kicked it in .
neutral	when we tried to extend our stay an_additional day , it took over 00_minutes for the customer service rep to tell me all rooms were booked .
neutral	only problem is i know there were rooms because the clerk at the front_desk checked and said there were plenty of rooms .
neutral	very frustrating .
neutral	was offered a better price than paid due to not being sent returns pack .
neutral	very convenient for evirophone i think .
neutral	should have use mazuma i think !
neutral	been with yahoo for a long time and used to be very good but their new version of the yahoo mail is worse than the previous one , too fidley , slow and if you use backspace ( out of habit we do ) then it jumps out and you have to log back in .
neutral	advertising as increased dramatically , annoying .
neutral	delivery was fine , small be necessary screws was missing from both bath and ladder rail , the screws from the bath are the eight wood_screws securing the legs brackets to the bath and the ladder rail are the 0 screws that locks the hanging brackets slides .
neutral	i ordered a torx multi_tool kit , which arrived in the time frame that was stated .
neutral	i really like the quality of the product .
neutral	about twenty_minutes goes by after i ordered the multi_tool kit and i thought i would try and find some outside mirrors for the jeep .
neutral	the weather is nice and since i will be getting the tool kit i figured i better be legal when i take off the doors .
neutral	i found some nice mirrors at a good price , it said they were in stock and they would fit my style of jeep , so i ordered them .
neutral	when my multi_tool kit arrived i ask the ups driver if he had another package for me , he said no that was the only one .
neutral	i thought ok maybe it will come tomorrow , well tomorrow never came .
neutral	another week goes by still no mirrors .
neutral	i called costumer service , the girl who answered looked up my order and said oh we are sorry_sir they are on back order we didn_'_t have them in stock .
neutral	she said they would be delivered the following week .
neutral	it sure would have been nice to know they we not in stock , because i might have found another style of mirrors that were .
neutral	i would have loved to be able to use my multi_tool kit and mirrors when the weather was good now they are talking rain for the next four days .
neutral	the price was great and we received the part quickly , but it doesnt fit_properly .
neutral	this was an aftermarket side_mirror for a ford e000 .
neutral	it can not tighten down flush the way the original mirror did .
neutral	its on the truck for now , but i will be looking for a used oem mirror that fits right .
neutral	i ordered air_filters and cabin_filters ( which arrived in a timely_manner ) for my genesis sedan and avalon , but i had to cut_off 0 / 0 of the cabin_filter ( because i '_m too impatient to send it back ), and the two genesis [ engine ] air_filters , bearing the same part number on the box , are completely different .
neutral	one is long rectangular while the other is the correct 0 - sided size .
neutral	all in all , pretty disappointed getting half of the order correct .
neutral	part of my order did not ship and i was given a refund .
neutral	no other explanation .
neutral	there were parts there when i ordered .
neutral	there were many other brands of the same parts available , but the order shipped without the rotors for some reason .
neutral	contacting customer service got no response .
neutral	my shipping address was removed from my account and when i reentered it i got the dreaded alaska problem .... your address doesn_'_t exist !
neutral	my house has_been at this address since 0000 .
neutral	so because your address database don_'_t know my address exists , i was given no shipping options unless i switched back to my p . o .
neutral	box .
neutral	if i '_m in a hurry those options won_'_t work and i will have to use a different company .
neutral	after searching for my part i found that parts_geek was the best price but it took two_weeks to get my part .
neutral	parts are good but service sucks .
neutral	you need provide a phone_number and have a live_person in customer service help people .
neutral	i had three recent sales dating from may 0rd .
neutral	i have only been paid for one .
neutral	still_awaiting payment on others .
neutral	i ordered a jacket which came quickly and was as pictured .
neutral	for the price , it was not clearly worth it , but close .
neutral	good price , very poor packaging for a mirror .
neutral	first mirror received damaged , so i '_m waiting for a rma to ship it back .
neutral	had to place a new order at full price and supposed to get credit in 0 to 0_weeks .
neutral	i hope it doesn_'_t take that long to get the rma .
neutral	just hope the next mirror is not damaged .
neutral	it took 0 days to receive the first one , hope this is resolved soon !
neutral	in the end this might be my first and last parts_geek experience .
neutral	time will tell , but not too much more time i hope ....
neutral	i bought a sofa_bed for my son from futonland .
neutral	when he went to the brooklyn store to check it out before we bought it , he was told there was no way he could see the actual bed , as it was in the back and he wasn_'_t allowed there .
neutral	we went_ahead anyway , but the very first night he slept on it , he said it was so uncomfortable , he would not be able to keep it .
neutral	i had not read their return / exchange policy , which is a 00_% restocking_fee plus another charge to pick it up , even if we were going to buy something else from them .
neutral	this would have been $_000 restocking + $_00 pickup fee ,
neutral	i went online to costco and for $_000 - delivery included - bought him a 0 " mattress topper , which made the ' bed ' something on which he was finally able to sleep .
neutral	he is very pleased with the mattress topper , not at all with futonland , their service , inhospitable customer awareness , lack of accommodation in being_able to actually see the item , and just a general disappointment overall .
neutral	i like the idea of getting parts at a good price , but the dilivery could use a little help . keeping them out of your driveway may save a sign or two .
neutral	i received the product that different than on the web .
neutral	i was really exceited at first when i got to the site ( 0st time user ) and saw my part listed for my vehicle for a good price .
neutral	i was disappointed when i got the part and found that it was the wrong one ( it was too short ).
neutral	i went back to the site to make_sure my car was listed for that part and it was , but upon futher searching on the site i found another part not listed on the same page as the other that is listed for my car as well .
neutral	i was disappointed that they were not listed together and i am hoping that i can return the wrong one and get this other one that may be the right sized part for my car .
neutral	travelocity needs to get the car companies to give there best prices when we the customer inquire for car_rental .
neutral	for example , i rented a car in jan . 0000 for april_0000 and the initial cost was $_000 + for 0 days .
neutral	then in the beginning of feb . the price went down to $_000 .
neutral	then in the middle of feb . it went down to $_000 .
neutral	so what gives with the variation in prices ?
neutral	expected it sooner , ordered thursday_morning arrived wednesday .
neutral	as of right now i '_ve had a great experience online , now once i get into the actual storage shop to sign my contract , i am hoping my rating will increase .
neutral	since reserving my storage all helpfull
neutral	disappointing product , but fast service .
neutral	took 0 business days to receive product .
neutral	they claim same day shipping but what that means is that they create a shipping invoice and then when it enters the system may be several days latter on the slow boat to your location .
neutral	have to say the product was great and also the price .
neutral	unfortunately the adapter plug was missing on arrival .
neutral	i called and spoke to someone_who advised he would order another ( this never arrived ).
neutral	i called back a week_later spoke to tom who apologised and had one with me the next_day !
neutral	it '_s a shame about the missing piece etc , but
neutral	good product and service from tom .
neutral	cheap price ~$ 00 / day was great .
neutral	car was fine , but made a racked typical of an old diesel engine .
neutral	return of car in heavy_rain was difficult - the gate at the airport would not open with the card supplied to me - the card got stuck in the machine .
neutral	staff was very friendly - i appreciate that .
neutral	from the airport , it was a bit difficult to find the guerin lot .
neutral	not visible from the exit elevators and a significant walking_distance from the other rental_agencies .
neutral	i ordered a manuscript italic pen .
neutral	the pen arrived quickly and there are no criticisms of the service i got .
neutral	however , the pen isn_'_t great .
neutral	at less_than £_00 , perhaps it is unrealistic to expect too much , but the pen is scratchy and the ink doesn_'_t flow so well .
neutral	i ordered a radiator it came at the right time , upon_opening the package the styrofoam endcaps were not on the ends of the radiator but were in the middle of the box against the fins forcing the radiator to one side and damaging some of the fins .
neutral	the radiator was also warped .
neutral	the transmission oil line fittings included with the radiator were cross_threaded fortunately by hand .
neutral	very poorly_packaged , hopefully it will work , if not ill send it back .
neutral	there is no reason for the styrofoam not to be on the ends to keep the radiatio centered in the box .
neutral	very poorly done .
neutral	love the glasses , and they were heaps cheaper_than i could get anywhere_else , so very happy with that !
neutral	as for the delivery ...
neutral	ordered glasses on 00th_december , they weren_'_t even posted until 00th_december , and they didn_'_t arrive until 0rd january .
neutral	i know it was over the christmas_period , but that '_s a long time to send them ...
neutral	i had items sent from the uk on the 00th of december that arrived by 00th of december .
neutral	all - in - all , not disappointed .
neutral	the wait was a small price to pay for the value i received .
neutral	i ordered two whisky miniatures to accompany gifts of glasses i was giving to a couple of friends .
neutral	the price of the whisky was good .
neutral	delivery was in time but the cost of delivery seems excessive .
neutral	the package was huge .
neutral	it looked like it had been designed for a full bottle of whisky rather_than a miniature .
neutral	cost breakdown :
neutral	0 singleton of dufftown 00 year_old miniature £ 0 . 00
neutral	0 jameson miniature £ 0 . 00
neutral	------------------------------------------------------------------
neutral	sub total : £ 0 . 00
neutral	vat : £ 0 . 00

neutral	fast service but one item was slightly broken and as all items were sent without written instructions , i didn_'_t realise ( tray for a volaris s0 ) until after it fell_off the rollator with a cup of hot tea .
neutral	the bag for the s0 didn_'_t seem the same as in the illustration and only came with short fitting hooks and no pop on straps - perhaps this is right but it is not clear .
neutral	waschtisch bestellt , ab gekommen , schnelle_lieferung avisiert - und_das wars erst mal .
neutral	nach mehr_als einer woche nachgefragt , grosses erstaunen , hektik , widersprüchliche aussagen , nach einer weile wird neuer liefertermin genannt und nebenbei erfährt man , dass die_lieferung einer privaten firma übertragen wurde und diese nur bis an die bordsteinkante liefern .
neutral	beim aufbau des schrankes sieht man , dass die richtigen auslässe fehlen , aufbau dauerte zu zweit 0h .
neutral	eine im internet vorab verfügbare masszeichnung bzw .
neutral	aufbauanleitung fehlt .
neutral	der schrank an sich ist schön , hat leider eine kleine fehlstelle , die wir erst später bemerkten .
neutral	insgesamt eine schwache leistung , nächster einkauf garantiert nicht hier .
neutral	i ordered an edwardian black and brass bed + mattress on - line , expecting delivery within the 0_weeks specified .
neutral	unfortunately , we were advised the day before delivery ( and a day taken off work to receive it ) that the supplier had provided the wrong_colour bed which caused a further 0_weeks delay in delivery while a replacement was ordered .
neutral	the price we paid was excellent and customer service was expertly provided by michael who kept me informed as the reorder was being_processed .
neutral	i everntually took delivery of my order and i cannot_fault the quality of the items .
neutral	wearebeds have since refunded some of the cost back to me for the inconvenience_caused .
neutral	not a smooth_transaction ( considering this was my first dealings with them so was a little anxious anyway ) but an excellent outcome .
neutral	please don_'_t let my experience put you off .
neutral	it '_s not what goes_wrong , it '_s how it '_s sorted and on that front i would give wearebeds 0_stars .
neutral	love the products .
neutral	the collar las 0_weeks and had no effect .
neutral	the spray also purchased was expensive and when you read the leaflet it states that this is to compliment other materials .
neutral	very expensive for the product and would not purchase any more .
neutral	when i checked in i was told i had a room on third floor .
neutral	i asked is there a elevator ?
neutral	since i recently had complete knee replacement and stairs are a challenge .
neutral	i was told they had no elevator and the y completely understood and gave_me a room on the first floor .
neutral	they were in the process of installing new refrigerators in the rooms .
neutral	mine had none , but was told one would be installed the next_day .
neutral	i was gone until late the next_day , when i returned no refrigerator was installed .
neutral	next_morning when i left i checked with the front_desk and told them i was suppose to have a refrigerator installed .
neutral	i was assured one would be installed that day .
neutral	when i returned that night there it was , they did as_promised .
neutral	these are why i said they took_care of me .
neutral	this is a older property , the maid service did a good job each day , cleaning and supplying clean towels & linen .
neutral	this property is near the airport , so expect hearing planes taking off .
neutral	i rate this as a negative , since i was aware of it '_s location .
neutral	but the price and the fact no parking fee '_s does make putting up with it .
neutral	excellent service but very disappointed to pay vat when it is not required .
neutral	i ordered a field parka last summer but hh had not received the stock . i called several_times to see what happened to it . however i gave up after several contacts . in february i had an_email to say that the item i had ordered was at last available , which i received within 0 days of re ordering .
neutral	the items should , like every other website , have a more detailed_description .
neutral	i deal with parts_geek and pelican parts for my porsche needs , parts_geek is cheaper but if i '_m not real sure if its the correct fitment i will buy from pelican parts and pay for the detailed_description and security .
neutral	as far as ups , when i can track the package going 000_miles right past my house spending an extra day in delivery them coming right back to my house , i question the opperations of a company
neutral	since i did not receive a confirmation on my order , i sent a customer service msg asking if the order had been received .
neutral	got back a msg saying that i would receive a reply in 00 to 00_hours .
neutral	never_heard back but the product did arrive in a timely_manner and so i didn_'_t have to send a dispute to the credit_card company .
neutral	the license_plate braket said it would fit my truck ,, it did not
neutral	dear concerend ,
neutral	one thing i found odd was that i did not get a confirmation_email after i placed the order .
neutral	i did get a confirmation number at time of check out , but i believe industry_standard for on line ordering ~ you normally get an_email with details of the order and the confirmation number ( kind of a summary ) right after your transaction .
neutral	other than that - things went well .
neutral	could never reach a sales_person to inquire_about parts and sales , once ordered never could reach anyone or be reached to ask about purchased item .
neutral	speedy_delivery but i do not think it is the right part and now come to find due to deeper research returns are only accepted with restocking_fee and that i could not have changed my order had anyone actually contacted me .
neutral	not impressed with service of company .
neutral	villa was generally good however bedding , towels and cleanliness was not up to the level it should have been for this type of property .
neutral	having finally sorted the payment out , i ordered for my daughter a sovereign cornet after_speaking with a pleasant young_man ( tom ) from sales i agreed and paid via a debit_card a very reasonable price but was told it may take a little_longer_than the 0 to 00 days for delivery but as it was needed fairly urgently i was disappointed but hoped it would arrive in time , the following_day i rang to ask about the situation only to be pleased to hear that it had been dispatched from france and that i could collect in a day or 0 as soon as it arrived ,. on ringing to check its arrival not happy to be told that it would in fact not be delivered till mid july as the suppliers had let normans down .
neutral	the payment was taken from my account when ordering on 00th_may i think this is wrong as payment should only be taken when the goods dispatched .
neutral	as conversations were generally cordial and pleasant between us i reluctantly agreed to let the order stand as this was my first dealing_with the company and sincere apologies were forthcoming i am prepared to think it is a one off , as it seems to go against the other favourable reviews on the web_site .
positive	the order was filled quickly and correctly .
positive	no_problems at all , highly_recommended .
positive	i found the parts i was looking for much_cheaper_than at major part dealer sites .
positive	the delivery was fast and the part fit_perfectly .
positive	great service .
positive	no_complaints .
positive	you will_definitely get more of my business and i will gladly recommend you to friends !
positive	honesty and sincerity are very important to have and i think that they have both .
positive	i would definitely recommend them .

positive	it is worth pointing_out however that a cyan cartrdge that i purchased last_week resulted_in a message on my printer saying " ink_cartridge is out of date ".
positive	i pressed the ok button and the printer has_been working normally .
positive	fingers_crossed .
positive	this was the first time i had come_across shima_uma and the price for the ink_cartridges was one of the lowest .
positive	i ordered over a weekend but the order was processed and despatched on the sunday and arrived tuesday - the earliest it could have for the delivery i chose .
positive	i had e_-_mails to keep me informed and the delivery was in the time window i was told .
positive	i will_definitely use shima_uma again .
positive	i would highly_recommend this type of car purchase .
positive	fast , friendly , professional , no pressure .
positive	selected car on - line , approved and out the door in no time .
positive	everyone was interested in helping_me and making_sure that i was satisfied with car and terms of purchase .
positive	first off i usually never get extended_warranties but when i purchased a hisense tv from tiger_direct something told me to get the warranty and would you believe one month after the warranty_expired the tv started to act up shuting off and on , i called square_trade and spoke to a fine gentleman_who seemed to know the problem right off , he over nighted the parts and set_up a tv repair man in my area to come to my house to fix it , which he did in about an_hour and so_far i '_m a happy man . square_trade rules

positive	never had an issue with shopto . net and will always purchase from them rather_than retail or anywhere_else via online .
positive	though they don_'_t encourage obtaining games before_release they do send pre_- ordered games out in plenty of time to avoid_disappointment on release_date .
positive	this has more often than not meant i have a new release a couple of days earlier_than if i went and bought it from a shop .

positive	easy , convenient , great value wouldn_'_t dream of shopping anywhere_else .
positive	it was the easiest airport drop_off and return i have ever_experienced with my car - no queues , a helping hand , friendly and efficient service and sparkling car handed back within two minutes of leaving the terminal .

positive	the future for me is stress_free parking .

positive	i '_ve been an ink_farm customer for a little while now .
positive	buying ink_cartridges for my old beat - up epson .
positive	i noticed one particular batch of ink ran_out much sooner_than was usual and not being a complete idiot , i realized the machines software is refusing to print even_though the cartiridges were removed , checked out and vigorously shaken to prove they were probably still about half full .
positive	i realize there is always going to be a percentage of ink left in any used and empty cartridge , and indeed there needs to be for a variety of reasons , ( even_though the industry tells us the ink is only worth pennies .)
positive	not satisfied , i e_- mailed a complaint to ink_farm and they replaced those cartiridges the same day without_question , free of charge .
positive	in all honesty , a good argument could have been made about the quality of my printer or its software being the responsible negative factor .
positive	regardless , ink_farm didn_'_t want to hear_anything about it .
positive	to them , the customer , even a small banana '_s customer like myself , was unhappy ; there was no way they were going to risk losing a customer or the goodwill generated and did what they had to do to ensure customer_satisfaction .
positive	that '_s a dedicated company for you .
positive	that '_s a company you should be doing_business with .
positive	ordered last_minute and they arrived within_00hours .
positive	was a little_apprehensive but needn_'_t have worried , as they are a great purchase and i would have no_hesitation in recommending .
positive	thank_you
positive	ideal accomodation , centrally_located with everything you need for a short stay .
positive	apartment was spotless - would highly_recomend

positive	i will use this again ..

positive	excellent service , i have only found a cheaper price elsewhere once , and i used there low price guarantee and they beat it !
positive	don_'_t shop anywhere_else tons of free stuff too !
positive	simply the best !
positive	i would like to know how cash0books . net determines their pricing for i would like to maximize their payments .
positive	first time i used inkfarm .
positive	called customer service ( on a sunday ) to have delivery address changed .
positive	did so very easily .
positive	will be back when i need ink in the future .
positive	everything worked exactly as it should and we could walk to the terminal and then back again on our return - and the price was cheaper_than in the mid term car_park when you have to fuss around with buses .
positive	i '_ll certainly use this service again .
positive	well detailed talk all along the bus journey
positive	what a great pleasure to do_business with a truly professional company .
positive	when i ordered i did so with the wrong measurement , instead of just sending what i asked for they queried what i had asked for and sent me the correct item and correct measurements .
positive	a high_quality product and a highly professional team .
positive	i recommend this company to anyone and everyone .

positive	we were also able to add my wife as a driver for no additional_charge .
positive	the only issue was the gas .
positive	i have always returned rental_cars full in the past , but the price they offered was less , so i figured why not .

positive	to get top quality hotels at amazing prices , you should bid at priceline .
positive	i had a business trip in fresno , ca ., and wanted to stay at the best hotel in town .
positive	the top star_rating was 0 0 / 0_stars .
positive	i checked many different websites , and the radisson had a lowest published price of $_000 . 00 per_night .
positive	i bid for a 0 0 / 0_star_hotel at priceline for $_00 . 00 , and got that price at the radisson .
positive	priceline '_s star_rating_system is very accurate , and i have used it on a number of occasions .
positive	with fewer empty flights and heavy air bookings , bidding on a flight is not as productive as it once was .
positive	bidding on a hotel_room , however , provides excellent results .

positive	i will_definitely use their services again if i go back to europe .

positive	this last order was the first time i ever spoke with someone at the company .
positive	they called me the day after i placed the order to advise they were having a difficulty obtaining verification from our vet so that i would understand if there was a delay .

positive	will always order from this company !
positive	one bit of advice when asking for help to get to where ever you want to go be sure to tell the person you are willing to walk to save on time .
positive	if you do not tell them you are willing to walk they will try and help you by bus travel only and the full loop takes several hours , so you can easily shave off hours by simply walking a street over to catch a different bus .
positive	ordering was easy on website ...
positive	i found the prices through a google_search and clicked through to the product page .

positive	sending_flowers internationally is always tricky as one is never sure that the delivered flowers are as high a quality as the presentations presented online .

positive	i have been using supplement_warehouse for several_years and continue to return .
positive	on the rare_occasion that i find a product for cheaper somewhere_else they always beat it and automatically adjust their price .
positive	i haven_'_t ever tried to find somethgin i wanted and not been able to find it here .
positive	words cannot describe_how good this website is !!!
positive	i refuse to shop for supplements anywhere_else .
positive	not only are the products priced cheaper_than anywhere_else , but the freebies are the best !!
positive	honestly , their shaker_bottle is the best thing in the world .... i dont even drink out of the cups in my house anymore lol

positive	i purchased a key for fifa00 and received it within 0 minutes .
positive	that kind of turn_around service should be the norm these days ....
positive	the big retailers should take a lead from ultimatum .
positive	so , i get my key in an_email , and try to stick it into origin and it won_'_t work ....
positive	i tried 0 times to get it to take ... no dice ....
positive	so i am totally flustered so i go to contact customer_support ...
positive	i get through within 0 minutes and after chatting with the rep for 00 seconds , i realized i was trying to put both codes in at the same time like a moron .
positive	after laughing it up with the rep , i was on my way to playing ... great first experience , and i will_definitely be back ...
positive	thanks again !

positive	happy customer with good quality and price glasses .
positive	i went to many optical retailers after visiting my doctor , i was very disappointed about their service and the lack detail information , advice and fair price to customer , all of them were uneven in price for the same prescriptions with same options , some of them over price them , some offered some options like uv protection or transitions but they had a lack of knowledge for eyeware new technology .
positive	any way , frames_direct has the latest_technology for you prescriptions glasses and you can feel_comfortable and confident about you purchase .
positive	fd send me my glasses very fast , i got a certified card form my lends and all the options that i choose while place the order , instructions and the original box and case for my frame taghauer , so i got full warranty for authentic frame plus certicard for all options that i selected .
positive	is just like buy a card but can not see the engine and hardware part .
positive	it is so important to me to know that i got what i pay for , in a reasonable price and with all the warranty from the experts .
positive	i had bought a 0s from a friend .
positive	for some reason , at & t did not have it in their system and after several calls to customer service , 0 trips to the store , they told me that i would have to wait for 00 months till it was eligible to be unlocked .
positive	i was about to put it on craigslist , but stumbled_onto this website .
positive	i was very hesitant to give it a shot , but after extensive checks on the web for indications of a scam , i didn_'_t see any .
positive	i was also leery that myimeiunlock was writing their own reviews but in the end , i took a chance and it was exactly as_promised .
positive	the directions were simple as well as quick turn_around .
positive	do it !
positive	redspot were good to deal with and i found the staff excellent with the exception of one person whom i suspect was a new employee and still feeling his way .
positive	he wasn_'_t unpleasant but was rather slow and unsure .
positive	friendly banter by me was returned in kind and in the spirit in which it was intended .
positive	i '_ve been using supp_warehouse for 0 years .
positive	now that they '_ve upgraded their shipping i '_m definitely now going anywhere .
positive	always great prices and the price_matching is unrivaled .

positive	over all fast service and easy service and i received the part exactly when guaranteed to .
positive	great seller

positive	when i went home for lunch the next_day it was sitting at my house .
positive	unreal .
positive	parts are parts , and you win some and you lose some , just about anywhere you buy from .
positive	that '_s the nature of the industry .

positive	i spent a year overseas ordering from bodybuilding . com until a buddy of mine told me he could get the same exact thing i ordered for much less at supplementwarehouse . com .
positive	i didnt believe him until i compared everything i order monthly and realized i was paying wayyyyy too much money .

positive	i take_care of my brother who is mentally handicap and likes to play video_games around the clock .
positive	he was nagging me to get him a $_00 psn_card .
positive	i normally get them at wal_- mart but we were in the middle of a snow_storm and i wasn_'_t driving out to it so i googled it and found this site .
positive	it looked secure enough and i am a bit of a risk taker so i took the plunge and did it .
positive	neither of us was too happy about the extra $ 0 . 00 charge to get the $_00 psn credit but i put in the code and it worked like it was suppose to .
positive	i guess paying the $ 0 . 00 is a minor_inconvenience when compared to being nagged by someone_who selfishly thinks of themselves all the time and tries to get you to do things for them not understanding the danger that i could be in .
positive	he '_s my brother though and i will_continue to love and care for him anyway .
positive	thank_you pc_game_supply for your service !

positive	i own a small business and travel on business nearly every week and am thankful for priceline .
positive	i can_honestly say the site has gives me peace of mind and improves my travel experience .
positive	corporate road warriors frequently have negotiated rates with hotels but as a small business i had no buying power .
positive	with prices always changing based on demand i always worried i was paying " too much ".
positive	with priceline competitive bidding i know i am paying a fair rate for the date and area i am traveling to .
positive	i use the instant deals prices as a window into the market rates .
positive	having said that , priceline '_s model is different that a typical booking site and there are situations that i don_'_t book thru it .
positive	basically any time i have specific_requirements for my room .
positive	for example if i want to stay at a specific hotel , i almost never book with priceline .
positive	if i am traveling with others and need a specific_type of bed i would never risk it as pricelines model is based on available rooms , not specific rooms .
positive	bottom_line : if use the service as it was designed you '_ll end up staying in nicer hotels than you thought you could_afford and will be one of the peps giving priceline 0_stars
positive	the part was more than i expected , assembly , bulbs and socket .
positive	i wish i new all that was included when i bought it .
positive	i didn_'_t know that the socket were included so emailed them and they got back with me right_away .
positive	also it took a long time to get here .
positive	should have tried next_day shipping .
positive	the service was very good .
positive	timely , easy ( even with 0 small kids ).
positive	would recommend ...
positive	salesman was excellent and helped enormously , understanding the need for urgency .
positive	the delivery guys were also excellent and didn_'_t complain_about anything despite the bed having to be delivered to the top floor of a 0 story town house !
positive	the product itself is of excellent quality
positive	it was easy to pick what i wanted with the best prices , and was super_fast to get the game keys !
positive	never had a problem with ordering from these_guys , good service , quick delivery and decent prices compared to others .
positive	wouldn_'_t buy from anyone_else at this stage .
positive	transaction was lightining - fast and very smooth : i didn_'_t even know this site existed and less_than five_minutes later i was submitting my cd - key to the guild_wars 0 website for activation .
positive	the transaction was also secure , using paypal , phone_verification .
positive	thank_you very much !

positive	our teenage_son struck a rock with our volvo and put a hole in the oil_pan .
positive	the local authorized volvo repair_shop estimated the pan replacement would cost close to $ 0000 . 00 .
positive	i checked around and found the price for the pan alone was typically about $_000 . 00 .
positive	( ouch !)
positive	i bought the pan and seal_kit on partsgeek for just under $_000 . 00 and installed it myself .
positive	our volvo is back up and running like it was before , and our son is looking for a car .

positive	autokey had a bit of friction with my phone service provider regarding their verification key , and i had to borrow my roomate '_s phone ( it '_s because mine is a prepaid ).
positive	other than that everything_went nicely and took like 0 minutes to get my key activated on steam .
positive	price wasn_'_t lowest on market , but i ' d rather pay a couple bucks extra to make_sure my key is a legit key from a legit source and not some russian black market key that might get banned any day .

positive	the best deal in town is getting what you pay for .
positive	parts_geeks takes that concept to a new level with the best prices , the best quality parts , and the superior service .
positive	i am refreshed that there is at_least one company serving america who puts customer needed , service , and ethics foremost in their dealings .
positive	most other_companies in america are " bate and switch " bottomline scammers .
positive	parts_geek is straight up and even our government could take some lessons from their example .
positive	it is so unique when the cheat and lie is not the main paradigym of a company as it is with the government and most companies .
positive	web_site works great and always easy to work with .
positive	this is by_far the best web_site to work with .

positive	bought tyres from kwik - fit online .
positive	they were very cheap – much less_than in the actual kwik - fit garage and much_cheaper_than elsewhere online .
positive	as i ordered 0 tyres it meant that i qualified for free mobile_fitting – so that '_s what i did .
positive	they were to come to where i work and fit them for me .
positive	on the morning of the fitting i realised that i didn_'_t have my locking nut with me and they were prepared to put the fitting on hold until it was next convenient for me , or i could have my money back and not have the tyres_fitted .
positive	i thought that this was great customer service .
positive	it turned_out that the car i was in did not need a locking nut after all ( stupid me ), and they came later in the day to fit the tyres for me .
positive	excellent service , cannot_fault it as they went the extra_mile .
positive	highly_recommended .

positive	i was needing a straightforward breakdown of build tools , specifically maven .
positive	vpp has a very inexpensive course on build tools that covers ant , maven , and gradle in that order .
positive	i '_m working my way through the course right now and am about halfway through the maven section , and i have to say that this is exactly_what i '_ve been needing .
positive	i would go so_far as to say that , given cost as a factor , this is much_better_than a live class setting .
positive	and the best part is the code works .
positive	i '_ve been using a lot of books and online tutorials in my studies , and half of the time the code simply won_'_t work because of some miniscule , undiscoverable reason .
positive	but with vpp , he really helps you get past all this and addresses issues you might run_into as you code along with him .
positive	i will_definitely purchase more of these videos when i '_m done with this course .
positive	this was my first order and was surprised the speed of delivery .
positive	there was no_hassel and all was straight_forward the way one wants and expects .

positive	both the prescription drug ( neomycin / polymyxin with dexamethasone drops - 0 ml bottle ) and the non prescription eye lubricant ( optixcare + hyaluron lubricant - 00 gm ) were far cheaper .

positive	package was a large box ( 000cm ) containing a guitar .
positive	weight was 0kg but most companies - e . g .
positive	parcelforce , dhl etc - applied a ' volumetric weight ' formula that increased it to 00kg !
positive	parcelhero did not and charged £_00 compared to £_000 + from other_companies .
positive	it arrived_safely within 0 days , 0 days earlier_than schedued .
positive	will_definitely use again .
positive	parts came fast and were the right parts i ordered
positive	easy to order item , delivery was super_fast .
positive	when package arrived and was opened , pajamas were better_than i expected !!
positive	!
positive	i have made several purchases from b h and they have at or below rates with same product best buy .

positive	having been pleased with barrington_sports in the past it was no problem for me to place another on - line order with them .
positive	the item ordered is of good quality at a very competative price and delivery and packaging was excellent .
positive	highly_recommended for anyone_wanting top quality sports products .
positive	really good service and at good prices .
positive	exchange policy works well - when needed
positive	fast service .
positive	good prices with incredible selection
positive	you claim they are powerful_magnets and i was not disappointed .
positive	we dropped our keys down a road gully but with the super magnet i found them in no time saving us a big bill for new keys .
positive	the only problem is , now the kids want an even bigger super strength magnet !
positive	myself and my wife use many supplements for various conditions .
positive	we have been using pureformulas . com for some time .
positive	we have been happy with their pricing and their fast free shipping .
positive	we love that they are carrying more supplements that we use so that we can buy on pureformulas . com for less_than the other_sites we have used .

positive	used blackcircle . com as it was a partner for the csma group and was easy from the start .
positive	i had a couple of tyre specs in mind and was unsure which would be best , but a quick call to blackcircle and a chat with one of their agents resolved that query quickly .
positive	making the order online and the follow_up from blackcircle was as easy as it gets and was with a local tyre_centre that i knew of but had never used .
positive	i went for the appointment and was very impressed with the tyre_centre and , assuming that all centres used are of a similar standard , would_happily_recommend the service to anyone .
positive	add a good price as well to the list and you have good reasons to use the service - well_worth it in my opinion !
positive	frames_direct handled all the basics very well , but then went_above and beyond by working to ensure my glasses were ready before a business trip .
positive	great service / commitment to their customers !

positive	it was much_easier to get online and use millet_sports who delivered me the most_recent model of the , " brooks beast ".

positive	00 . 0 % of the time has everything i need at a great price and fast shipping really don_'_t know what else you could ask for .
positive	my only food for thought would be and this may be a stretch is do warehouse to warehouse shipping so i can have a better shipping rate rather_than from c & b_& f and before you know it 00 or 00 in shipping_charges even the extra wait for package would out weight the cost to me .
positive	the property was very clean and well_maintained .
positive	i felt that my belongings would be safe and secure there .

positive	i highly_recommend this business .
positive	i had ordered a fog_light_lens for the passanger side for a acura 0000 tl which came by ups it had a tracking_number that you could go to for ups and it would tell you everything about your package on were it is i know that i am one of these persons that likes to worry a lot over nothing and going back and looking at the ups_tracking helps out and lets me know were its at i '_m 00 with a lot of medical problems and with tracking_system it really helps .

positive	i usually shy away from pens that are too inexpensive because you never know what the quality will be - especially when you have several upper crust pens in your collection .
positive	this is not the case with pens from mr .

positive	they are not only perfectly weighted but the feel on your fingers is , quite simply , and exquisite experience .

positive	found what i was looking for at a great price , tax free and free delivery !
positive	first of all , it '_s a lot cheaper_than other warranties .
positive	this was the second warranty i purchased for an iphone .
positive	i did not have to use the first one ( yay !)
positive	but when my battery started_acting up recently ( shutting off when there was still 00_% battery left , stating i had a certain battery percentage then plug it in and it jumps 00_%) on my iphone 0 ( outside of the apple warranty ) i first contacted apple to see what they could do and they said i needed a new battery and it would cost $_00 to replace it .
positive	ouch !
positive	i thought i would just suck it up until i replaced the phone but then i remembered i had my squaretrade_warranty so i opened a case and in my contract it said one battery replacement , although this was more geared toward phones where you could easily replace the battery , and the customer_support agent spoke with her manager who authorized the repair without having to pay a co - pay !
positive	brought my phone to the apple_store to have the battery replaced , sent squaretrade a copy of my receipt , and on the same day i received an_email that it was accepted and the money was in my account .
positive	i can '_t believe_how easy and smooth the claim went down .
positive	i would recommend to anyone !

positive	we utilized our existing wiring and added a wireless option that gives us the best of both_worlds .
positive	the timing for getting out to our house and getting this installed was fantastic .
positive	great company to deal with

positive	after a lifetime of heavy smoking i '_ve been vapeing with ecigwizard for a month now .
positive	originally sceptical , as i have never tried to give up or cut down cigatettes before , i have bought a selection of diferent ego & 000 kits , along with several different tobacco flavoured ejuices .
positive	my verdict is that .. i love it ..
positive	i can get my nicotine fix , even in public places , without all the dirty ash and harmful carcinogens .
positive	its fun to try all the different_flavours , cartomisers etc , and i '_ve already cut down my fags by about half .. sooo ... give it a whirl .. it works ..!!
positive	!
positive	did everything on line ie : chose tyres local fitting_center and date to be fitted , payed .
positive	received email_confirmation straight back later to be followed by another giving time and the name of my personal contact if i required any further help .
positive	arrived at the fitting_center were i was expected and i put a couple of other things i wanted doing to them .
positive	nothing was to much_trouble and everything got done including the extra bits id asked for .
positive	all in all a good experience and cost me less_than what i usually pay .

positive	my friend recommended and hi was right .
positive	good serves .
positive	i '_m happy
positive	avon ct_town_fair_tire is the best and only spot i '_ll shop for tires .. the selection is great and the prices even better .
positive	when they say nobody_beats town_fair_tire , they mean it !
positive	i have bought several sets of tires and even a wheel and tire package here over the years for my last several trucks and my wife '_s car .
positive	this most_recent_trip in was for my wife '_s bmw 000xi coupe .
positive	i mainly dealt_with two sales_reps , wes and greg , however the entire team of guys was willing to help and offer their input .
positive	i like to do my research but we needed this set of tires rather quickly and the they were really patient and knowledgable , walking me through all my options and explaining every detail i wanted to know .. not only are the sales guys great but it is obvious that 0he guys in the wheel and alignment shop really know what they are doing , they had the tires_mounted , balanced and aligned quickly and without_any_issues .
positive	i left with what i feel is the absolute best , safest set of tires for my wife '_s car .
positive	thank_you !!

positive	i didn_'_t have time to reply straight_away but would do so when i got home in the evening , however during the afternoon i missed a call from them and they left an answer phone message .
positive	as soon as i got home they called again and offered me the alternative but i decided to stick with the smeg i ' d ordered and wait_until thursday .
positive	they even took the trouble to enquire why i preferred to have the smeg over the alternative ( the smeg is thinner to give me more head room ).

positive	like most pet_owners we would spend on our dog whatever it cost for treatment and never question a vet bill .
positive	only by chance i had their latest invoice on my desk when i researched his condition .
positive	when i found i could save around 00_% on his medication i was suspicious .
positive	but when the medication arrived it was from the same batch with the same date as the first lot i had purchased from my vet .

positive	i ordered some lettering for my boat and it came exactly as needed .
positive	fast shipping , good value lower price that my local sign shop .
positive	i may not have paid attention but if there is a heavier grade vinyl i would go with it next time around .
positive	only because the lettering will likely scuff against the dock cushions / bumpers and being thin it may damage a bit easier then if it was a little thicker .

positive	plus , the price was very reasonable .
positive	if anyone is considering_purchasing or customizing jewelry , your first stop ( and likely your last stop ) should be brilliance . com .

positive	i have used chemical '_s site several_times now .
positive	there is a huge_selection of the sort of music and fashion etc that i like , more than any other site i '_ve_seen .
positive	the things that i like most is you don_'_t have to fill a sign_up form , you are informed at each_stage via_email that your order has_been received , then processed , then shipped ( there are numerous options for postage too which i rarely see elsewhere ).
positive	then it arrives on time within a couple of days .
positive	sounds simple but i hate it when companies take your order then several days after email to say items are out of stock or there is some delay then you have to chase them up a week_later to see whats_going on because they haven_'_t had the courtesy to update you .
positive	i have never had one single_problem with chemical_records , and would recommend then to anyone .
positive	the prices are great , they are easy to do_business with and in the event you do have an issue , which is very rare , they are super helpful .
positive	used cult_pens twice_now both_times i ordered one day and had the pen the next .
positive	i purchased 0 winter water bags to place at the end of my automatic pool_cover to keep the leaves from blowing in to the pool .
positive	placed and filled 0 of the bags and noticed a couple of days_later that 0 had a leak in it .
positive	did not pay much for each bag and had the 0 spares so i used 0 of them and it has held and it is doing the job of keeping the leaves from blowing in to the pool .
positive	despite the name -- five green stars , no black_circles , or red ones !
positive	ordered a packaged unit from here and shipping was great .
positive	had it in less_than a week .
positive	installed and i couldn_'_t be_happier .
positive	definitely recommend ingram '_s to all my friends .
positive	thank_you all

positive	website said they were in stock and they were despatched and with me within a couple of days - excellent .

positive	used espares before and they never_fail to please .
positive	i will_definitely use cult_pens again .
positive	have found it very difficult to find brooks runners online recently so turned to lanson_running .
positive	australian retail_stores refuse to lower the prices of runners even_though the australian dollar is strong , so i prefer to shop for runners , running gear online .
positive	have been impressed with the service
positive	i used jalbum from the beginning .
positive	jalbum is the easiest_way to handle big amounts of photos in albums locally and remote on a server .
positive	i used it a lot for family fotos .
positive	and for community photos on my web project .
positive	there is no easier way to manage albums on the web .
positive	a lot of people were disappointed because jalbum changed from freeware to shareware .
positive	but jalbum is worth paying that little amount of money .
positive	and it '_s a lot of work to keep that kind of software up to date .
positive	one is more eager to bring out new features if there is a return .
positive	:)
positive	as for java apps in general you need a not too slow box and of course a properly configured javare .
positive	i '_ve never had a computer refusing to run jalbum .
positive	we bought two cars in the past twelve_months both_times using carsdirect . com .
positive	in both_cases they were extremely_helpful in locating the vehicles in a timely_manner .
positive	the visit to the dealership the first time was less_than 00_minutes , totally_painless .
positive	the second purchase , no so much .
positive	the finance manager was a total jerk and screwed_up the paperwork .
positive	he was making us travel all the way back to accomodate his mistake ( it was easily an_hour drive , round_trip ).
positive	rather_than dong this , we simply called our contact at carsdirect . com and he set the dealership straight and made them mail us the corrected documents to sign .
positive	i will always use carsdirect . com , the amount i could save negotiating on my own is not worth the countless headaches it would require .
positive	i had a working code within_seconds of ordering .
positive	completely painless .
positive	this is the easiest , cheaper and best way to stay in touch with your family overseas
positive	quick , reliable and very good value for money .
positive	right part good price thanks

positive	easy to use web_site full of information , great shipping and the once or twice i had a problem they resolved it quickly and to my satisfaction .
positive	i ordered a 0 gallon water_heater that was priced for less_than several other_websites .
positive	not only was it an exact original_equipment replacement , it was delivered the morning after it was ordered .
positive	talk about fast service !
positive	000_% satisfied with this experience .
positive	its cheap ( ish ), usually a bit cheaper_than elsewhere and the delivery time is awesome .
positive	been using shopto for a long time and i haven_'_t been_disappointed once !
positive	extra super_fast service shocked me completely .
positive	your " better_than i could have imagined " service left me with a huge smile .
positive	i had the car apart and repaired it ( myself ) before the next parts even arrived .
positive	i don_'_t know if the second order of parts will fit because i haven_'_t gotten back to the project since the first parts arrived so fast .
positive	but , i do have renewed faith that they sent me the right parts ... since they obviously resolved my first challenge with such ease .
positive	thank_you so very much , and i will do much more business here .
positive	rest_assured .
positive	gratefully , jeff oldham

positive	in this era of " throw_away " action , it appears , that pen_refills are not usually purchased , even for attractive gift pens !
positive	!
positive	after a long chase round the net to find a refill for paper mate pens i found " cult_pens " and a safely_packed , prompt delivery of correct refills , accompanied_by a surprising free_gift , was delivered .
positive	i can certainly recommend this company for the prompt and courteous service with a well stocked catalogue of both pens and refills , even without the free_gift !!

positive	i know this doesn_'_t always happen , but it was a nice surprise .

positive	why ?
positive	0 .

positive	i '_m a procrastinator so a $ 0 part can make me miss a $_000 track day weekend .
positive	the areas of improvement :
positive	0 . allow customer reviews to be added to products .
positive	i know they are not the best but several real world use would be helpful .
positive	0 . you say if you won_'_t use them , then you won_'_t sell them .
positive	not sure how some brands ( i . e .
positive	icon ) is at all track oriented .
positive	i don_'_t think they would even make that claim .
positive	0 .
positive	i know you are track specific , but that is only one part of the total market .
positive	trackday and racers also like to cruise , motocamping , etc .
positive	should consider expanding or else start a sister company and share back office and logistical resources .
positive	sister company would allow you to test the waters without hurting your stg reputation .

positive	i was a little_hesitant of them a couple years_ago , tried them out and have continued to go back ever since .
positive	generally just buy steam drm games , so they plug right into my steam client , but have bought other non steam games , ea , ubisoft and all work just fine .

positive	having phoned about many_times for the best price oil , boilerjuice always come up_trumps and with an added saving after ordering the oil i can now treat_myself to a bottle of wine ....
positive	i '_m now using the boilerjuice saving scheme too !
positive	just found this site looking for the best deal on some mhp isofast 00 .
positive	they didn_'_t have the best price ... until i plugged in the competitor '_s price and then they beat the best price i could find .
positive	true they don_'_t offer free shipping ... but they ' re pretty honest about the deal since the sites i compared that offered free shipping truly were more_expensive in the long run .
positive	now to see how fast the shipment comes in .
positive	i '_m originally from wisconsin ( where they company is located ) and now live in ca so hopefully the shipment gets here fast .
positive	i '_m almost out of protein and don_'_t want to go to the local store and pay $_00 more per container .
positive	thanks supplementwarehouse !
positive	great customer service !
positive	stg has the most honest and detailed video reviews of motorcycle_gear on the net , period .
positive	you can get a detailed overview of a product from anyone_who sells anything , but only stg will tell you both the good and the bad , give an honest_opinion , and tell you exactly_what is and isn_'_t going to keep you safe for however you plan to ride .
positive	you can check prices with search_engines and haggle out the best deal if you think you can beat them , but call them up and you will get the best price on the safest gear with the best quality .
positive	i couldn_'_t be_happier with every_single item i '_ve bought and conversation i '_ve had with these_guys .
positive	they ' re the best , and they '_ve earned my business for life .
positive	that '' s just the way it is .
positive	i primarily bought it because it was the best product i could find to attach my ipad0 to the car headrest ( to keep my 0 year_old entertained on long trips ) but now i use the carry case more than i do my official ipad_cover - which isn_'_t as sturdy when i stand the ipad up .
positive	so that '_s a win / win as far as i '_m concerned .
positive	what else can i say ?
positive	the name says it all really ... it '_s a snug fit on the headrest - no need to worry driving around cos it moves with the car .
positive	i tried another headrest mount which attached to the ipad with clamps and that didn_'_t fill with me with confidence so i couldn_'_t be_happier .
positive	this was the first time that i used this dealer - the service was prompt and efficient .
positive	the web_site was easy to navigate .
positive	i quickly found everything i was looking for .
positive	prices were somewhat better_than other on - line sources , and , of course , considerably_lower_than the brick - and - mortar_stores .
positive	my order was shipped promptly and arrived in a few_days .
positive	everything was in perfect_condition and exactly as_advertised .
positive	had best priced and got them to me very quickly
positive	quick ship , best price , part exactly as_described .
positive	b_&_h has always been very " user_friendly " to deal with .
positive	their technical help has_been a big_plus .
positive	easy , no_problems and they kept us informed with the ability to track the order .
positive	my glasses are great , i got the best price on ray - bans out of everywhere i looked and they always responded right_away to my questions via_email .
positive	swift servcie at a good price .
positive	tyres working well ( although they have only been on the car for a few_days ).
positive	i order my part , and i got it next_day .
positive	the part is good , and the price is good too .
positive	after we submitted our inquiry , we heard back quickly from david chen , one of the account managers at flashbay .
positive	and once we confirmed on the logo , we received the mock - up so fast it was shocking .
positive	everything else went_smoothly , and our 000 0gb white bracelet usbs were so beautifully printed .
positive	thanks so much david and flashbay !
positive	i was able to accomplish exactly_what i needed in a quick and efficient way .

positive	they have proven to me that the do care about the customer .

positive	after calling all the parts stores in town and getting prices over $_000 , then calling every salvage and u - pull it lot within 000_miles to be told they can '_t look up the part , i found it on partsgeek listing on ebay .
