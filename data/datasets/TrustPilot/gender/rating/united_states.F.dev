negative	very unsatisfied with product .
negative	it was shipped with multiple wrong parts .
negative	it took months to resolve .
negative	they stopped answering my calls to get the right parts so i had to call credit_card company to get a credit before they finally responded .
negative	i wish i would have read thier reviews online prior to buying .
negative	my husband drove 00_minutes one way to the location to sign the contract because i was told the facility was only open every other day .
negative	when he got there the facility didn_'_t have the confirmation that he showed them on his phone and didn_'_t even have storage available .
negative	he then drove back .
negative	he basically wasted 0 . 0 hours of his day because sparefoot didn_'_t bother to check with the facility .
negative	we worked hard to send out email invitations for our customers past and present to leave reviews about their experience with us .
negative	trustpilot then called us to sign_up for their paid service and we declined because we used another review company at the present .
negative	0 week_later .. the handful of reviews we had on trustpilot were all taken down .
negative	very disappointing .
negative	i ordered two pieces for a halloween_party in sept . 0_weeks_later i called about my order and was assured it would be here by or on the 00st .
negative	with halloween being on a monday i explained that the costume was for parties and not trick or treating and i ordered early enough not to have to worry .
negative	i was told one piece was on back order and would be sent out as soon as it came in .
negative	one week before halloween , i emailed ami that i no_longer wanted the order .
negative	0 days_later they replied that i piece was shipped and the other piece was refunded .
negative	when i received the one piece in the mail ( on the 00st ) it was nothing like the picture .
negative	so i used their return_label and sent it back to them .
negative	in mid nov .
negative	i got it back with a standard form as to why they would not except the return .
negative	the form had several reasons listed , but none were checked .
negative	instead they hand wrote at the bottom that i didn_'_t have some_sort of return # that is required ???
negative	after several emails and 0 phone_calls i finally spoke with a manager .
negative	just to be blown off and told i was not getting my money back .
negative	thats when i disputed the charge with my credit_card .
negative	after explaining everything to my credit_card company .
negative	they agreed to dispute the charge .
negative	mid dec . the charge was returned to my account and the dispute was finalized , or so i thought .
negative	the rest you can call coincidence if you want but on christmas_eve , less then 0_weeks after the dispute was final and the first tim ei used my card since sept , my card was declined for a purchase .
negative	when i called they told my there were some questionable online charges that same day that were not mine , so they voided my card and are sending me a new card with a new number .
negative	since i rarely use that card it was easy to who might have had access to my information .
negative	of course i can '_t prove who did it and the attempted charges totaled less then 00 dollars , it seems like a feeble attempt done just to mess with me .
negative	i am also very confident that this review will get a response from ami a lot faster then any of my complaints that went directly to them .
negative	the reason is it say '_s you will deliver the ink in two_days , it took 0 your ink is already running_out i only had it one week
negative	poor service and poor quality this is not the first time this is my 0nd
negative	this website is a scam !!
negative	bankrupt !!
negative	!
negative	since august_0000 i bought 0 bags for 0 . 000 €, which they never sent !!
negative	i tried to contact them by email , they took so long to reply , and only to tell me they were available and going to send them .
negative	so i waited … after a long while , i decided to cancel my orders and pick some other bags instead .
negative	i did this 0 times from august_0000 to now , mid - february_0000 , more than 0 months !!!!!!
negative	and i '_m a good client , i spent more than 00 . 000_€ in a year and they sent me most of what i ordered , even if it took 0 months for some !
negative	but since august , whenever i sent them emails , when they replied ( half of my messages were never answered ), they gave_me partial answers .
negative	on the 00 / 0000 i asked them to send me the bags or let_me choose some others instead .
negative	they told me they cancelled the orders so i could pick something_else .
negative	they didn_'_t reply until the 00 / 00 to tell me they would check again .
negative	but i got sick of waiting so i asked my boyfriend , who is italian , to have a look , as his father is a police officer and he knows people in italy that could help me , so he called some governmental office to ask them about fashionqueen . net , and guess what ?!
negative	fashionqueen doesn_'_t exist !!!
negative	it is not registered , the p . iva it00000000000 doesn_'_t exist !
negative	!
negative	my boyfriend wrote an_email to fashionqueen to ask them to send me the bags and reply to the many emails i sent them , otherwise he would sue them in order to get a refund .
negative	and guess again ?!
negative	here is the answer :

negative	meanwhile , be very careful !
negative	i will sue them and call the italian authorities + i already have a lawyer there … let '_s see ...
negative	i received the wrong part and in order to return it i have to hurdle through their website and possibly pay restocking fees regardless who '_s fault it was , they titled the merchandise correctly they obviously don_'_t stock their merchandise correctly .
negative	unable to get through by phone after on hold for 00 plus minutes .
negative	that '_s not right , i will never do_business with this website again .
negative	the first bag didn_'_t do any good but thought i would give it a chance and try again , the second bag nothing .
negative	good morning , i would know how long it will take yet ?
negative	the data regarding purchases are .
negative	the application number 000000000 and the number of screening gm000000000000000000 .
negative	i was told in march_0000 that i had a year to use the credit i had on a return flight i cancelled .
negative	i knew you all would find a way to deny me my credit and you did ... i found out , when i tried to use it that it was a year from when i booked the flight ; which was january_0000 ... i will never use travelocity again and i will advise all friends against it as well .
negative	i was extremely disappointed with the delivery of some fence panels that i had delivered .
negative	as i write this i am still_waiting for their delivery .
negative	these were ordered on the 00th of may .
negative	todays date 00 may .
negative	i phoned selections on the 00th to enquire where they were .
negative	i got a silence then i got we have been busy , so they may take longer to get out to you , even_though i had received an_email_stating they had been dispatched on the 00th , then another on the 00rd .
negative	i then got as there was a short stock the could of sold out .
negative	they said they would look into it and call me back .
negative	i was told they had found the panels and they would package them up and send them out that day , so i would get them on the 00th .
negative	what a surprise no panels .
negative	so i hope i will get them tomorrow ??????
negative	?
negative	i purchased tailgate cables for my 0000 tacoma from parts_geek .
negative	the part was listed to fit 0000 - 0000 .
negative	i received them and they were 0 / 0 inch too long .
negative	i contacted both parts_geek and dorman to verify if that was the correct_part and both stated yes .
negative	i went to my local toyota dealer and purchased one cable and it fit .
negative	it was 0 / 0 inch shorter_than the one from parts_geek .
negative	i got my rma_# from parts_geek and they stated they would not refund the original shipping cost because dorman says they fit .
negative	the part does not fit and toyota looked at it and verified that it was too long .
negative	so i got screwed on 0 . 00 shiping and 0 . 00 to send it back .
negative	pg said too bad for me .
negative	they suck !!!!!
negative	!
negative	i was not happy with the teds socks that i received .
negative	i ordered a medium and received a small which did not fit .
negative	i will return them when i get a chance
negative	i placed an order in nov 0000 ... nov_00th i received an_email_stating my order had shipped .
negative	today is jan_00th 0000 and i am still_waiting for my delivery .
negative	i have sent numerous_emails , faxes and unanswered phone_calls .
negative	this company frustrates me to no end !
negative	i place my first order on sunday , 00 / 00 / 0000 .
negative	today is wednesday , 00 / 00 / 0000 .
negative	only now do they decide to ship my order out to me !
negative	the time it will take to ship my order via ' smartpost ' still remains to be seen so , this is still an undecided total failure to me .
negative	all in all , a very dissatisfactory transaction for me .
negative	i suppose that i '_ve been completely spoiled by ' amazon_prime '_s ' efficient shipping methods .
negative	' nuff_said .
negative	ami has the worst customer_service .
negative	returning / exchanging item is the biggest hassle of all time .
negative	they do not even let you receive a refund .
negative	only store credit that does not even deduct right_away at check out .
negative	horrible getting through their phone system .
negative	u will never get through so don_'_t bother .
negative	they also try to rip you off by not even showing the price of the item on your order sheet .
negative	doesn_'_t even show you how much you paid for anything on the invoice they ship .
negative	clothing quality is very cheap and poor .
negative	they photoshop too much so you can '_t even tell what kind of material the item is .
negative	they don_'_t even state what size model is wearing .
negative	i just received my ink_cartridges .. two black and one color in a set .
negative	installed the first black_cartridge this morning and got an immediate alert on my computer that the cartridge was depleted .
negative	when i checked the ink level it shows 00_%.
negative	terribly frustrated .
negative	not sure if i will trust them with another order .
negative	i have had issues rebooking my flight , actually being_able to speak with someone , and so_far have still not gotten it fixed after being transferred to several people .
negative	i will never purchase anything through them ever again .
negative	the only way this is being resolved is by united which has had wonderful support .
negative	i would advise to not support priceline .
negative	i sent you a check at the end of april , which i knew would take some time for you to clear it and get the order out , but then about a month_ago you sent this note indicating you had sent the ink ... and i still do not have my $_00 worth of ink !
negative	i am retired and don_'_t have lots of money , so i trusted you .
negative	i have needed this ink for some time and cannot_afford to go and buy some until yours comes .
negative	my order number is 0000000 .
negative	i would like some kind of a response , please .
negative	my address is 000 betts rd ., orrington , maine 00000 .
negative	beware .
negative	i booked one room at a great rate but was only allowed to book one at a time .
negative	i needed two rooms for my family , but when i immediately went back for the second , the same room had gone up 00 %!
negative	i haven_'_t received the product yet , hence i can '_t rate the service .
negative	i have been using priceline to get rooms due to relocation for my job .
negative	this past week my job told me after i booked a room that they didn_'_t need me .
negative	i attempted to get a refund for the room i booked and was told there was no way to get one .
negative	so i ended_up spending 000 . 00 for a room for a week that i didn_'_t have to spend .
negative	i think the policy needs to be revisited for occasions such as the one i stated .
negative	i have used this site on several_occasions but will now consider other avenues .
negative	i will not recommend this site to any of my business partners nor friends .
negative	jeg_havde bestilt en computer ved proshop med forventet levering inden for 0 - 0 dage .
negative	da de dage er gået ringer jeg til deres kundeservice der fortæller mig at den kommer om yderligere 0 dage .
negative	jeg_har nu efter yderligere 0 dage kontaktet , hvor jeg spørger ind til problemet og hvorfor jeg_er_blevet lovet noget de ikke kan holde .
negative	medarbejderen beder mig om at lade være med at være flabet og fortæller mig at det_har de aldrig sagt .
negative	altså er jeg både flabet og en løgner .
negative	de må åbenbart have kunder nok når de behandler dem på_den måde
negative	ja så nu har de mistet en kunde der eller har_handlet ved dem i 00 år som privat og nu skulle have første bestilling som erhverv .
negative	men ak ja det blev_så den sidste og_varen er nu også afbestilt
negative	my order failed to arrive at its_destination on the specified date , which was crucial .
negative	then when i contacted iflorist about this they failed to respond twice to my enquiries , even_though they promised to .
negative	when i sent a letter to the company with photocopied evidence of my communication with them i received notification that my order would be delivered the next_day - 0_weeks late .
negative	quite_frankly what was the point in doing that ?
negative	the intended surprise for our daughter '_s celebrations was lost .
negative	it would have been far better to have received my money back .
negative	very disappointing experience .
negative	i had trouble accessing the completion part of my order the last two times i tried to shop online .
negative	i requested assistance , got none , wrote and said you needn '_t send me any more great deals online , as i wasn_'_t going to go to all the work of getting my order ready , then being_able to do nothing with it .
negative	so , friend to friend , goodbye nygard !
negative	no phone_number , complaint made via_email , received a reply but didn_'_t address the complaint at all , poor quality merchandise , am one step away from reporting this company to trading_standards , will never use again !
negative	whilst the product itself once eventually delivered was perfectly acceptable , the delivery was poor .
negative	i ordered premier delivery , and was advised delivery would be between_0am - 0pm , so i ordered it to be delivered to my work address knowing anybody would be there to take delivery as my daughter was dying to get her product .
negative	the product was delivered at 0 . 00am therefore the reception was closed even_though i start work at_0am .
negative	so ... rather that ring the number given - my mobile the delivery company took the product away and instead of ringing they sent me a letter , hence delaying the delivery a further 0 days .
negative	never again !
negative	!
negative	i '_ve just ordered flowers for a friend in lancashire and the prefer confirmation_email looks like it is coming to me in edinburgh instead .
negative	i definitely put her address in of 00 lancaster gate , fy0 0aw .
negative	when you look at previous_orders you can only see the billing_address and not the delivery address or indeed the person you are sending them to .
negative	help
negative	i need to the flowers to go to her not me .
negative	still after all the phone_calls and my detailed review your company still does not get it !
negative	yes i am aware about proof reading my own custom card . this huge error had nothing to with mispelling or anything i myself could contol .
negative	this was a huge printing error that never should have been sent out . instead of blaming the customer take ownership you are ones advertising custom printing on greeting_cards . not me !
negative	i paid to use your service . what i received was not perfection or anything close .
negative	your printing machine put a huge bar_code through all the names across the signature line . the bar_code does not go on the inside of any greeting as i am aware of ? also when i previewed my custom card there was not any bar_code ... this was smeared and you affixed the gift_card on top of the error as to hide it . if i did not peel the gift_card off i would not have seen it . also addressing a customer the way you just did on a public forum shows me once again ... you do not comprehend the issue that occured , you have no remedy in sight . nor do you have plans of addressing the fact that the whole_process the printing of the card and gift_card is automated and entirely executed by a machine including putting the finished printing project into an envelope .
negative	yes ... you give the customer a chance to poo roof read theirnprinting lay out however .... you have no one in your company over seeing your printing for errors by your machines . if you did this card you sent out would never have been sent out . i have no control over bar_codes .
negative	nor is their an option to place or removeca bar_code . do you even understand the problem ?
negative	because the reply you offered was disappointing and appauling . blame the customer for your ineptitude ?
negative	again the customer has no control over your malfunctions of your machines .
negative	hire a proof reader . treat your customers with some respect be empathetic of the issues you create . think about what you reply to your customers . that is if you want them back . i wont be back . i own a real_estate and a construction company for 00 years . i have never blamed a customer for my failings shame on you !
negative	i ordered my order 0_weeks_ago and it hasnt even shipped yet !!!!
negative	they already took my money but they havent shipped my vitamins !!!
negative	its absolutley riddiculous !!
negative	!
negative	placed an order on 00nd may as i was going away on 0nd june .
negative	i paid for priority postage because of the bank_holiday_weekend .
negative	left 0 messages on an answer phone and sent three emails ( including a request for a refund of postage ) and there was no response to any !
negative	in desperation i ordered from a competitor on 00st may and received the order the following_day - post free .
negative	i received my order from zest on 0nd june - 00 days after paying for priority postage .
negative	now 0th_june and i have still not received any response to any of my phone_calls , nor my emails .
negative	zest '_s customer_service is absolutely disgraceful .
negative	i ordered 0 items from the store only got 0
negative	i ordered a part , got it in 0 week , wrong one , i had ordered the wrong one , i then shipped back at my expense then finally got the right part , 0 days_later .
negative	still all in all very bad_experience , and my last with them .
negative	absolutely the worst .
negative	unless you consider " fast " 0_weeks +.. also , the repair job was terrible .
negative	i had two arms replaced on a pair of chanel frames .
negative	when the estimate came through about the repair they asked if i wanted new reading lenses put in .
negative	i chose the lenses and paid for the amount and was told they would be mailed out quickly .
negative	when i finally received them the two arms were attached differently and were " floppy " - cheap workmanship , and there were no lenses that i had paid for , and they charged me $_00 shipping .
negative	the online_chat person arial was unhelpful and would not let_me speak with a manager .
negative	a wholly awful experience after waiting almost 0_weeks .
negative	i called amex and disputed the charge and they found in my favor , refunding the full_amount .
negative	so , buyer_beware .
negative	go elsewhere .
negative	never use these_guys .
negative	they made several errors during the processing of my visa that delayed me .
negative	someone wrote in an_email , " will someone please contact this lady ?
negative	she '_s a real pest ."
negative	the email string got back to me .
negative	i was simply asking questions which is what visa agents are meant to do .
negative	then , they got the dates wrong about my return home .
negative	nobody answered my emails in a timely way .
negative	while i was away they sent somebody_else '_s passport to my house .
negative	luckily my family is honest and sent it back but these people are incompetent and not to be trusted with secure information !
negative	first two times i shoped with them they were fast , the products were good and i had good price .
negative	so , they asked me to give a good review to their company here .
negative	i did .
negative	after i had somee trust and kept buying from then and they never sent me the products .
negative	i have lost around 0 thousand euros with them .
negative	some orders , like the 0000 / 0000 was made almost 0 months_ago .
negative	others had many itens , but they just sent me the cheapest product and no explainations .
negative	for this they have good prices , because must of the orders made are never recieved .
negative	this is how they play .
negative	those are the numbers f my other non recieved orders :
negative	0000 / 0000
negative	0000 / 0000
negative	0000 / 0000
negative	0000 / 0000
negative	they were never sent or they just sent me the cheapest iten .
negative	please , dont spend your money with them , its like lotto , you are never sure you gonna recieve what you bought .
negative	the part was " made for my car " yet the cables were much too short !
negative	i will be returning this faulty product
negative	i will not order again from pureformulas . com
negative	i ordered 0 yellow knockout_rose plants , 0 gallons at $_00 . 00 each costing over $_000 and took a chance ordering online plants for the first time .
negative	order #_0000000 0 - 00 - 00 fedex_ground .
negative	i received this order on 0 - 00 and was extremely disappointed in the quality - yellow leaves , no flowers , small plants .
negative	its been 0 days and the plants are still yellow , still no flowers .
negative	i took a picture when i received these and sent to brighter_blooms .
negative	i have yet to receive a reply .
negative	so add back customer_service to the complaint .
negative	interestingly - i also placed an order from a competitor , park seed .
negative	i received the order yesterday .
negative	rainbow knockout_roses that are full of blooms , gorgeous , green_leaves .
negative	so guess which nursery i will prefer ?
negative	it '_s been over a week since i ordered this and it still_hasn_'_t come .
negative	ordered from this site because i had a google offer , but amazon is more reliable and the price is just as good .
negative	i only got half of the items that i ordered .
negative	the swimsuit i got was the wrong_size .
negative	the other part of my order never got to me , i was refunded for that amount , but of course not the shipping_costs .
negative	i only agreed to pay that much for shipping because i the amount i ordered made me think it was worth it , not for what i got though .
negative	it took me a long time to pick the stuff i wanted and make_sure they had the size i needed .
negative	my vacation is gonna be in 0_weeks so of course i wont return the one bikini i got so that they can never send it back to me anyway ...
negative	wish i ' d know about this before , bad customer_service communication as well .
negative	would help to have someone_who understood english .
negative	first order was sent with wrong items and we were promised the correct items by the next tuesday but nothing came .
negative	i called again that friday and was told that items could not come until my return ( picked_up by fedex ) was processed .
negative	very frustrating as the mistake was no way my fault !
negative	a very nice rep_named sarah said that she would try to correct the problem .
negative	i do have pool perfect now , but will probably go to another company for my next order .
negative	i paid to have flowers champagne and chocolates to deliverd to my honey in the uk for valentines_day recieved e_- mail feb 00 due to adverse_weather the flowers only would be delivered ????
negative	no chocolates or wine ???
negative	no flowers were delivered nothing was and it was valentines !!!!!
negative	callled my bank stopped pay they are investigateing i advise alll to re post this and never ever to use these crooks !!!!
negative	!
negative	lisa kempt ps please investigate my complaint i would love you 0 !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

negative	this company doesn_'_t tell you ahead of time that it takes at_least 0 - 00 days to even put the product together before it ships .
negative	i paid_extra 0_weeks before christmas and it never arrived .
negative	now it '_s 0_weeks after christmas and still nothing ( not even a note from this company updating me of the status ).
negative	i '_m starting to think that they ' re a scam .
negative	i ordered 0 cards , i believe the first week , in december .
negative	i have not received anything yet , and it is almost
negative	christmas .
negative	the cards are visa .
negative	they are for 00 . 00 each .
negative	the merchanize was size wrong or something and i could have bought the same brand at walmart
negative	i placed my order april 00 , it said everything was in stock and should arrive within 0_weeks .
negative	i checked today , 0_weeks after my order was placed and the order is still processing .
negative	i called in and they said the order won_'_t ship for another week and a half .
negative	absolutely_ridiculous !
negative	the gentleman i spoke with said it is advertised that it takes 0 - 0_weeks , which i informed him was still less time than my order would be .
negative	he also informed me that i would run_into the same issue from any company i ordered from since they get it from the same place , which is a flat out lie considering every other website says they have it in stock and would ship within 0 - 0 days .
negative	i am very disappointed and will not be ordering from them again , in fact i think i am just going to cancel my order and go somewhere_else .
negative	it would be quicker that way .
negative	at_least they don_'_t charge you until the order leaves their ' factory '.
negative	heute wurde irgendwas gekauft über mein paypal , als_ich die email auf meinem handy erhalten habe , habe_ich_mich sofort bei paypal versucht einzuloggen und_habe den fall reklamiert , anstatt mein geld zurück zu holen oder sonstiges wird nun auf die antwort des verkäufers gewartet , abwohl die adresse die angegeben wurde nicht stimmt bzw verändert wurde .
negative	paypal behält das geld sowohl vom käufer als auch verkäufer ein und bereichert sich so an zinsen .
negative	um probleme zu klären benötigt paypal oft wochen , bis sich endlich was tut .
negative	wenn dieser fall beendet ist , werde ich mein konto bei paypal löschen , hier wird keinerlei sicherheit gewährt .
negative	mit kreditkarte oder bankeinzug kann_ich auch anders bezahlen , dafür brauche ich kein paypal mehr , zu mal die sicherheit bei paypal gleich 0 ist !

negative	i bought months_ago skyrim box and got it broken , cjs said on facebook i will get a refunde , i `_m still_waiting to get my refunde to purchase another game with that .
negative	as i posted it to facebook they canceld me on it , so i can ` t write anything on the wall .
negative	supporter ( cj poh ) told me that the nw sniper elite dlc will cost 0 , 00 gbp and i will see my refunde when i buy and pay the item , now the dlc cost 0 , 00 gbp and i still can ` t use or see any refunde !
negative	arcor gibt_es zwar nicht_mehr und ist nun vodafone , doch als_ich im jahr 0000 einen arcorvertrag abgeschlossen hatte , war_ich ansich relativ zu freden , abgesehen davon dass ich von dsl 0000 nur dsl 0000 empfangen habe und mein nachbar direkt neben mir dsl 0000 hatte , nach einigen jahren hatte_ich dann massive probleme , so dass ich alle 00 - 00 sekunden vom internet flog , dieser fehler wurde nie behoben also reichte ich meine kündigung ein , diese wurde aber nicht akzeptiert womit ich dann per anwalt die kündigung einreichen musste .
negative	0 jahre später hebt eine inkasso firma vo arcor 000_€ von meinem konto ab , die_ich bis heute nicht zurück bekommen habe .
negative	ich_habe damals ein paket von gmx geschenkt bekommen , das filme , serien usw kostenlos angeboten hatte , leider gibt_es bei maxdome nun neue pakete , wodurch mein paket unnötig geworden ist , da man die filme auch als free - user kostenlos sehen kann , auch der dazu gehörige bereich ist_sehr bedürftig .
negative	in meinem paket sind fast nur filme die erotik beinhalten oder serien , wo man nur 0 oder 0 episoden sehen kann und_das oft in schlechter qualität .
negative	serien die im tv bereits gelaufen sind , sind 0 tag kostenlos zum anschauen dabei , am nächsten tag wird diese wieder in die teuren pakete geschoben , weil angeblich keine lizens ist_für das jeweilige paket .
negative	nur ein tag darf es laufen und dann nicht_mehr , schon eigenartig !
negative	ich_würde maxdome nicht weiterempfählen , jedenfalls nicht als free user oder user mit einem film paket , der nicht auf erotik filme steht .
negative	purchased a full price bra , and after removing the tag and hand washing i noticed a hole in the bra .
negative	herroom refused to exchange for a non_- damaged bra .
negative	i was within the 00 days but they said because i had washed it i could not return it .
negative	no exceptions , just kept_repeating the same policy over and over .
negative	talked to a supervisor who was equally rude .
negative	why are you asking me to review your service when you haven_'_t sent me the transcripts .
negative	the person_who i sent the card to as a thank_you called the number on the back to activate it and it was a false number .
negative	they continued to tell them that she would not be able to use the card for 0 days !
negative	first of all , your center is misleading .
negative	i googled the hotel i wanted to stay at and pulled_up what i thought was their webside but as it turns_out it was yours with no_indication whatsoever that i wasn_'_t speaking to the hotel_directly and expedia '_s name was nowhere to be found .
negative	the person i spoke with was kooky and during the conversation telling_me : " oh , we just booked a king_room , it '_s gone , etc . "
negative	i asked for a handicapped_accessible room with two beds and he assured_me there was one available on the first floor with grab bars .
negative	when i got to the hotel there was no handicapped_accessible room with two beds available , so i had to go somehwere else and pay for another room .
negative	he did not advise me that it was nonrefundable .
negative	if he had told me he was a third_party i would have known to ask .
negative	i will never use expedia again and will tell_everyone about my bad and expensive experience .
negative	this is the worst booking_agency ever .
negative	they disconnected twice .
negative	then i booked a room an the confirmation came with the wrong type room .
negative	we called and spent 00_minutes talking to " john " who refused to help us !
negative	he promised a manager would call within 00_hours .
negative	no one called .
negative	john promised they ' d fix the issue .
negative	they didn_'_t .
negative	we got an_email_saying they can '_t change the price .
negative	we never had a problem with the price - they gave_us a king smoking_room and we asked for 0 queens non_smoking .
negative	furious !
negative	they refuse to fix their error and won_'_t cancel the room .
negative	this is a terrible service .
negative	terrible !!!
negative	i recommend that people run away from this company - they ' re absolutely horrible !
negative	!
negative	i bought a dress from lightinthebox . com before .
negative	the quality is not good .
negative	there are many china b0c websites , like milanoo . com , luxurywill . com , or pandawill . com .
negative	you can try others
negative	when i was asked to organize teacher holiday gifts this year , i just about had a heart_attack .
negative	there are 0 teachers covering 0 toddler classes with about 00 families .
negative	i really hoped that giftcards . com would save me a lot of time coordinating this year '_s gifts .
negative	most_importantly , i just wanted the teachers to feel appreciated and loved for the great work they do with our children .
negative	after setting_up all of the giftcard sites , i thought i could just sit back and let the donations sort themselves out according to the number of classes each teacher taught .
negative	not so fast , after the first day , one of the cards showed a maxed out amount of $ 0000 .
negative	the donations listed did not add up to that amount .
negative	calling the help line and writing to tech_support did nothing to solve my problem .
negative	they took so long to get back to me that i had to find another way around it .
negative	this glitch cost us 0 days and i had to set_up another card .
negative	plus , this teacher ended_up receiving two cards with different amounts ; making this gift not as polished as it could be .
negative	after this i thought ... ok ... that '_s annoying but not a deal breaker .
negative	wrong again .
negative	a second card showed a maxed out amount of $ 0000 .
negative	this time a name was attached to a peculiar amount .
negative	i contacted that parent , who did not make that donation .
negative	we both had trouble getting that changed .
negative	reason ?
negative	they need an invoice to look up our order , but an invoice is generated when one redeems the gift_card , and when a card is redeemed , they can '_t change anything in the account .
negative	what a glorious catch - 00 they have going .
negative	we can '_t help you unless you do this , and even then , we still can '_t do what you need us to do .
negative	this glitch caused this particular teacher '_s gift to be sent a day late .
negative	completely_unacceptable .
negative	it was not in time for the class to present the gift to their teacher .
negative	when it is time to do teacher gifts again in june , we will certainly not choose giftcards . com .
negative	perhaps their other services work more smoothly .
negative	this is simply my experience with their group gift feature .
negative	first order arrived_promptly .
negative	second not so great !!
negative	still_haven_'_t received it and i contacted them yesterday to ask if i can expect it anytime_soon and was told to leave it 00 working days ... today is day 00 , why they couldn_'_t look into it on day 00 is beyond me considering i would have expected it at most 0 working days_later .
negative	update
negative	i made my order on 00th of april , money left my account 00th_april ... no package arrived .
negative	contacted them and got told they ' d send another , waited 0 working days ... did not arrive !
negative	contacted them for a refund ... now 0 working days down and no refund has appeared i '_m being to think i won_'_t see my money again !
negative	please_note i asked for the refund on 00rd may after waiting for 0 orders to arrive from 00th_april and the date is now 0th_june and i have no perfume or refund !
negative	i '_m not holding my breath for my money back .
negative	seems very dodgy to me !
negative	dont ever use travelocity .
negative	our reservation was not at the hotel .
negative	we stood aroud for 0 hours while this problem was fixed
negative	i booked with flighthub thinking it was the cheapest flight ... guarantee ... but imagine my surprise when i went to the airline '_s website and the exact flight i just booked on flighthub was cheaper on the airline '_s website .
negative	i emailed flighthub immediately to bring up this issue and have not heard back yet .
negative	customer_service ??
negative	?
negative	started ok , filled in my reg number etc , chose the appropriate tyres listed for my car , went to get them fitted only to be told that they were the wrong_size .
negative	spoke to customer enquiries and was told that they would collect them and send out the correct size .
negative	they did drop_off the correct tyres later in the week then promptly took the new ones away again , leaving the original unsuitable tyres behind ..... i used this company in good faith that it would make my life a tad easier , it didn_'_t .
negative	it has taken an unacceptable length of time for these tyres to finally fitted .
negative	i will never use this company again and would advise strongly against other people doing so also .
negative	( cant leave ' 0 ' stars )
negative	i have had a really bad_experience with this company .
negative	i ordered 0 dermalogica_products on 00th may and only one arrived but the money for all three has_been taken .
negative	to make_matters worse , i have sent 0 e_- mails , submitted 0 of their contact forms online , phoned several_times never getting any response except an answermachine and left 0 voicemail messages .
negative	no - one from the company has got back to me either by e_- mal or phone .
negative	as a result , i couldn_'_t recommend this company to anyone .
negative	0000 volkswagen eurovan fuel tank cap - 00000 stant - $_00 . 00
negative	qty ordered : 0 , qty shipped : 0
negative	tracking_number : us mail : 0000000000000000000000 - mon 00 / 00 / 0000 0 : 00_pm
negative	00 / 00 / 0000 parts_geek llc 000 - 0000000 nj 00000 usa gas / automotive $_00 . 00
negative	the above information was copied right from the e_- mail sent to me when i placed an order for a locking gas_cap from parts_geek .
negative	i felt the price was very high when you added in the $ 0 . 00 shipping fee .
negative	the gas_cap itself was only $_00 . 00 .
negative	but i accepted that .
negative	now the problem is that the gas_cap does not fit my 0000 volkswagen eurovan .
negative	so when i send it back at a cost of $ 0 . 00 to ship it i will have spent a total of $_00 . 00 .
negative	then i read that there will be a 00_% restocking_fee .
negative	so if i get back 00_% of $_00 . 00 that will be a refund of $ 0 . 00 .
negative	total loss to me , not counting the cost of time and money to take it to the post_office , is $_00 . 00 .
negative	by not sending it back it will only cost me a dollar more .
negative	actually it will be cheaper not to send it back because as i said i will have to use gas to make the trip of 00_miles to the nearest shipping station .
negative	do you think this was planned .
negative	i really feel taken .
negative	i was not happy .
negative	i typed in exactly_what my car was .
negative	your company said it was a certain radiator and it was not the right one .
negative	it won_'_t fit any style jaguar .
negative	you should fix your computer because it was very costly mistake for me
negative	i will not be buying anymore parts if i have to pay for your mistake .
negative	i have liked everything i have gotten
negative	i received an extra order that i did not make and was charged for it .
negative	i don_'_t appreciate that kind of tactic and as a result , have closed my account .
negative	placed my order on dec 0 , 0000
negative	when it still had not been shipped by dec 00 i started calling i got the run_around about if it was shipped .
negative	they finally shipped it on dec 00 only after i said i would cancel order .
negative	now usps lost my order and because of oldies waiting so long to ship there '_s no time to reorder from another website !
negative	it was soooooo bad i now use expedia !
negative	!
negative	worst customer_service ever !
negative	the part did not fit and they are making me pay to return it even_though it was advertised to fit my car .
negative	they threatened to take a 00_% " restocking_fee " out of my refund .
negative	they will not respond to my concerns via_email and the phone_number never goes to a person only a machine .
negative	buyer_beware !!
negative	!
negative	i ordered 0 items and got told one of my items was out of stock .
negative	they told me that i would get a refund , which i have never received .
negative	postage was also very slow , i will not be using again as i paid for 0 items not 0 !!!
negative	!
negative	i bought these products to give to my dogs .
negative	i have bought nosodes before and they came with specific directions , how to mix , how often to give etc .
negative	i asked and their reply was to call the manufacturer .
negative	i think if you are in the business of selling nosodes , you should have more knowledge as to how to take and for how long .. where i ordered in the past , the owner shared their expertise with me .
negative	prices are good though .
negative	this company has terrible customer_service , don_'_t answer emails , and when you call , they talk down to you .
negative	we had a medical_emergency .
negative	when i tried to call about the hotel , you did not answer .
negative	when i called the hotel , the evil woman at the desk said i had to talk to you .
negative	when i finally talked to someone the next_day , you promised to call a manager and try to get me a refund , and to communicate with me .
negative	you did none of these .
negative	i will find another travel site the next time .
negative	i called and spoke to irene poltiile .
negative	i specifically_asked if she was with the hampton_inn deer park ill . she said yes hotel reservations .
negative	she gave_me prices which i confirmed were incorrect .
negative	i told her we were flying in for a wedding for my godchild and there was a block of rooms being held .
negative	she said they were all sold out and there were 0 rooms available only at the price she stated .
negative	i thought i had no choice so i took them she gave_me the phone # for the hotel in case there were changes and i was not coming in .
negative	did not like this whole situation .
negative	called hotel as soon as i hung_up and was told i did not talk to her hotel and there were tons of rooms available .
negative	called your company right back to cancel and told a man the situation he said he would cancel .
negative	decided to call back to check to see if it was cancelled and it wasn_'_t .
negative	then spoke to brandon and he did cancel and the hotel verified it was cancelled .
negative	i would never ever recommend doing_business with you and still do not see the reversed charges your company charged me .
negative	please take_care of this or i will report you to the better business .
negative	i ordered a new phone by phone with the promise of next_day delivery using £_00 crave vouchers and my own money to purchase phone . saturday came and went and no phone delivered .
negative	rang virgin on the monday for further updates ..... still no phone by_midday so after further phone_call was told it had been lost in transit .
negative	was told to wait for another 00hrs .... which i did .
negative	tuesday still no updates so rang to find that phone was still lost ..... so asked for refund .... however cos it was in yodels hands couldn_'_t give a refund .
negative	was advised to wait another 00_hrs .
negative	wednesday still no phone , still no update so had to chase them up again .
negative	asked for refund but was told i would loose my £_00 crave vouchers so have to wait another 0 days for a phone .
negative	i was told to go out and buy a temporary phone and they would reimburse_me with this purchase ..... however when i rang back to say i had bought a phone and requested the money they had no_idea what i was talking_about and refuse to help me .
negative	will never purchase a phone from virgin mobile again .
negative	i was promised a mobile_phone .... next_day delivery ..... 0 days_later and the phone has still not been delivered ...... it apparently went to wrong depo ..... they can not trace it transit and tell me when i will receive my phone ...... terrible terrible service
negative	what a nightmare .
negative	i paid good money for 0 / 0 dead plants .
negative	how can you stay in business ?
negative	i will never order from your company again !!!!!!!!
negative	!
negative	well it has_been 00 days and the money has_been taken out of my account for the items but i still_haven_'_t received a package so i haven_'_t even seen the clothes to judge them .
negative	i ordered a gift_card and received it in 0 - 0 days .
negative	it was guaranteed by google .
negative	after that i decided to order another one .
negative	don_'_t know anything about these sites and didn_'_t realize it can only be used on line .
negative	i decided one more chance with gift_cards .
negative	forget it never again .
negative	!
negative	everytime i put all my info in it kicked back and said they could not process my order so i put in another card 0 and it did the same thing .
negative	i tried 0x '_s and again the next_day and the next_day .
negative	i gave up and went to another site and purchased the card i needed .
negative	thanks for nothing gift_cards .
negative	i canceled my order .
negative	i was unable to obtain any clarity from anyone at petflow as to the status of my order .
negative	i ordered royal_canin veterinary brand which requires vet approval which has not been problem in the past .
negative	i placed my order last_week and since that time , petflow insisted no vet authorization was received .
negative	yesterday , my vet '_s office personally spoke to your company and faxed authorization more than three_times .
negative	yet , when i called your customer_service today , " clare " said no authorization was received .
negative	i also spoke to " gerry " who has to be the most arrogant individual with whom i have had the displeasure to speak .
negative	no one in your organizaiton knowns anything .
negative	when i called later today to cancel my order , all i heard was more arrogance .
negative	i had been ordering royal_canin veterniary diet food from your company for several_years .
negative	whatever happened to your efficiency over the years is unfortunate .
negative	i don_'_t want to deal with your customer_service people .
negative	they just don_'_t care and i need a food distributor that does .
negative	if you think your getting a bargain your wrong !
negative	i bid on a rental_car and won , really i lost but just hadn_'_t realized it yet !!
negative	when i picked_up the car at hertz , it smelled so bad of cigarettes i was coughing and my eyes were burning .
negative	it took over 0 hours of trying to get a hold of a person to trade in this car .
negative	then they had the gall to put me in a tiny car when i had upgraded to a larger one .
negative	i received multiple_emails saying it was being looked into but no resolution at all .
negative	this company is awful , no customer_service and nasty filthy smelly cars .
negative	pay more and be comfortable .
negative	i will never use them again !!
negative	!
negative	i purchased a futon_cover online with thefutonshop . com , and minutes later , emailed to cancel my order .
negative	after ignoring two emails requesting the order be canceled , i called thefutonshop .
negative	i was sent a confirmation_email_saying my refund would post in 00 - 00_hours .
negative	a month later , i was going through my credit_card bill and saw that no refund had been issued .
negative	i called again , and i was told that for " some_reason " the accounting department had not processed the refund .
negative	i was again assured that the refund would post in 00 - 00_hours .
negative	i am never buying from these people again .
negative	what a hassle .
negative	ordered a special_diet for my dog over two_weeks_ago .
negative	haven_'_t seen it yet .
negative	when i call all i get is bullshit excuses .
negative	refund ?
negative	" no your order shipped by fed - ex , when ?, " we don_'_t know " do you have a tracking_number ?, " we '_ll e_- mail it to you , e_- mail says tracking_number not available .
negative	what shoddy , shady site .
negative	i placed an order for obaby mini mouse retro buggy on the 00th - 00 - 00 rang them on 00 / 00 / 00 and was told it will be delivered monday00 , waited in allday , no buggy , rang tuesday only to be told they had none left in stock and i would have to be refunded , they oviously had them in stock when they took the money out of my account . will never order from them again and the staff arent very helpful as all they ever tell you is no body is available on customer_services .
negative	this was , in all honesty , the worst online shopping_experience i have had in living memory .
negative	having placed and paid for an order , i waited about a month and received neither a dispatch email nor a package in the post .
negative	i tried to log_into my online account and received nothing but errors .
negative	i called the company , and was given the automatic message multiple_times that lines were busy - before being automatically hung_up on .
negative	after several tries , the phone finally rang and i was second place in the queue .
negative	second .
negative	the second person !
negative	how in god '_s name can they not handle more than two callers on the caller waiting system ?
negative	are they using phones , computers and systems from the days of king nebuchadnezzar ?
negative	because i '_m pretty sure things were a lot more up to date in the time of jesus .
negative	eventually , i spoke to a representative who informed me that there had , unfortunately , been a slight_delay with my order .
negative	you think ?
negative	you bloody think ?
negative	i ordered a month_ago and you ' re telling_me there '_s been a delay with my order as if i could never have guessed .
negative	and how difficult could it have been to send a brief email , maybe after two or three_weeks delay , to let_me know of this ?
negative	the representative eventually informed me the product would be with me the next week .
negative	two_weeks_later , nothing .
negative	i called up again .
negative	after chatting with yet another useless employee of this godforsaken company , i was told that my order had been cancelled and refunded .
negative	cancelled and refunded ?
negative	and nobody thought it would be a good idea to inform me ?
negative	apparently , i should have been sent an_email .
negative	well , i wasn_'_t .
negative	it wasn_'_t in my junk folder either .
negative	repulsive .
negative	another two_weeks_later , and i haven_'_t received my refund .
negative	i call up and was informed that it had been processed and i should have received it .
negative	well i bloody well haven_'_t , you goat head !
negative	after several rants and a threatening email , i receive a letter to take to my bank manager to ask him to process a refund .
negative	not only did i get such stinking service , but i have to go out of my way to get my money back .
negative	how in the world can one company be so overwhelmingly rubbish at everything they do ?
negative	are they able to do anything right ?
negative	i will pray , every night , for the bankruptcy of this company .
negative	nothing so crap deserves to live .
negative	my advice to everyone in the world is - save_yourself the trouble and avoid this disastrous mistake of a sales company .
negative	absolutely disgusting service .
negative	hello friend
negative	i am very disappointed in my purchase .
negative	the ink_cartridges do not work in my printer .
negative	i want a refund
negative	i ordered 0 willow hybrids , spending over two hundred_dollars .
negative	my trees arrived dead and seemed like nothing more than a bundle of sticks .
negative	:( very disappointed
negative	i purchased a futon_cover online in early november_0000 .
negative	it was not the color described / pictured online - at all .
negative	and the material was cheap polyester which looked a much heavier weight thread online .
negative	i called and emailed customer_service to begin an exchange , per the process listed on their website .
negative	they offered to send me swatches to help me pick an item to exchange my purchase for - sounds great , very helpful ...
negative	it is the end of january_0000 and i have received nothing from them .
negative	i have called multiple_times and emailed to alert them to the issue , inquire_about the status of swatches , etc .
negative	now i know why they don_'_t do returns , only exchanges .
negative	if you don_'_t like the product , they send you through hoops until you give up and they get to keep your money .
negative	it should not be this hard to make an exchange or refund .
negative	there are too many online vendors out there that do this better .
negative	i '_m now out $_00 and have a hideous futon_cover that i will never use and probably can '_t even get_rid of on craigslist .
negative	never again .
negative	was a few_minutes late for mot appointment & was refused - told car couldn_'_t be looked at
negative	waste of time emailing about issues you will only get a generic email and no real answers to questions_asked also to return a product takes a lot of time and is impossible for me as was purchased as a gift so cannot do what is required as i don_'_t personally have a console or account to do this action
negative	out of pocket and a lot of time wasted trying to get relevant answers not worth the bother
negative	assuring delivery in 00_hours and then making me wait a week kinda sucked .
negative	i think your products are as low in quality as your prices .
negative	i will never use you again .
negative	i am still_waiting for the vitamins i ordered , never have i had such a bad_experience .
negative	i called they never answered the mail box is full .
negative	very unfortunate .
negative	you just lost a good customer .
negative	i was very disappointed on how every time i would try and purchase a flight , the price would change .
negative	yet when i returned to the site , the flight i wanted , was still advertised at the low rate .
negative	i spent numerous hours trying to purchase a flight no_matter the price .
negative	however , again i was redirected or simply told i could not purchase and to search for a different flight !!
negative	i will never use travelocity again .
negative	always delivered quickly and prices great .
negative	but received a batch of lenses where 0 lenses were damaged .
negative	was told it was a production / manufacturers fault .
negative	when enquired_about replacement lenses felt very insulted by cheeky email that they would put £ 0 in my bank or send me 0 lenses - not worth the bother i ' d say !!!
negative	went on to find there was another 0 damaged lenses in box !
negative	worst_experience we have had with car_rental very very slow at counter led to believe car would be at airport , wouldnt rent to my husband because he was 00 and the list_goes on , and to add_insult to injury we lost money on the deal because we chose to go elsewhere .
negative	just awfull
negative	ordered tennis dress for tennis holiday in greece .
negative	dress arrived_promptly .
negative	the dress was too small and no time to order larger_size .
negative	no returns_label or procedure enclosed with dress .
negative	contacted supplier and told to use online returns centre - tried but nowhere to fill in returns_form .
negative	tried from friend '_s computer and still no joy .
negative	contacted milletsports few_times and was told they would email me with returns_form attached .
negative	i informed them that i would be flying out to greece in the early hours of 00 / 0 / 00 .
negative	still no returns_form emailed to me .
negative	arrived back a week_later and returns_form waiting in inbox .
negative	immediately filled in and realised there was no returns address to send parcel to .
negative	currently awaiting reply to yet another email_asking them where i return the dress !!
negative	apparently the postage is only refunded if the item is returned within 0 days - well maybe it '_s a ruse to ensure they don_'_t have to refund the postage .
negative	am i happy with my experience at milletsports ?
negative	no
negative	i have no_intention of ever shopping with them again - it '_s their loss as i do buy regularly online but there must be a working and reliable returns_policy in place .
negative	i used_serenata_flowers to send my niece an upgraded bouquet of flowers in totnes .
negative	but instead she received a bouquet of unopened lilies and flowers and it was terribly put_together , and it looked nothing like i had ordered .
negative	i asked them to replace the order as it was shameful to send flowers of that nature but they continued to tell me that we needed to count stems , take more pictures even_though we sent them pictures , they claim the picture was bad .
negative	unfortunely it was not the picture that was bad , it was the bouquet of flowers that was badly put_together .
negative	serenata in reading uk was very good as i have used them many_times before ., but i will never use serenata in totnes .
negative	they are a scam , they are terrible and provide terrible customer_service too .
negative	their non_- acceptance of issues is also terrible customer_service .
negative	unfortunately , i am a florist and we have higher expectations of our counterparts .
negative	this company '_s flowers and service is a disgrace to the floral industry .
negative	this florist in totnes needs to be monitored as it is a shame to have a shop do such shoddy work and provide such terrible service to the flower industry .
negative	its people like this that get folks thoroughly disgusted with the floral industry .
negative	having waited 0_weeks for sofas - i am disapointed that they had not been delivered earlier like i
negative	we were so excited to finally be able to spend thanksgiving with my son and his family .
negative	i was bringing the smoke turkey , so i ordered form figis 00 days in advance .
negative	their website accepted my order and i called several_times to make_sure they had my order and confirm it was coming before thanksgiving .
negative	the more calls i made the more disappointed i got .
negative	each time we called their cs department they told us a different story : ( 0 ) they have 0 orders under my name !!!
negative	really ?
negative	( 0 ) no order was found under my name or order number ???!!!
negative	( 0 ) go buy a turkey because it might not arrive on time , no problem we will refund your complete payment ( 0 ) it is arriving via_fedex this afternoon ( 0 ) it already arrived at the post_office ????
negative	( 0 ) we send the order fedex directly to the post_office and the po delivers to your home !!!
negative	really ???
negative	on thanksgiving day the post_office is not opened ??
negative	?
negative	in summary the turkey never arrived on thursday , we went out of town friday_morning and returned sunday_night … the turkey arrived and was dropped in our heated mailroom and was no_longer smelling good when we openned the box .
negative	figis returned half of my money and told me that was their policy !!!
negative	nice job figis !!!
negative	!
negative	i bought some flowers to my mother - in -_law in recife , brazil , to be delivery in a special day and had payed an extra fee to be the fastest as possible .
negative	my credid card was accepted .
negative	i have just received an_email right now ( 0 days after , the delivery day ), informing that it wasnt possible because it was a '' remote_area ''.
negative	first , is not a remote_area .
negative	it is in the middle of a big city , not in a farm .
negative	second , if you cannot do the job , dont do it , that is ok , but dont make me wait 0 days to say it .
negative	now i dont have time to buy it for any other place because nobody is gonna delivery in a saturday_morning .
negative	if you aren_'_t making 00 baskets for 0 out of state conferences , expecting your $_000 order to come within a month , don_'_t need to reach customer_service by ' live_chat ' or by phone within that month of waiting for your products to arrive , then myfavoritecity will not disappoint you .
negative	they do have unique items but the stress and anxiety they caused me for my biggest order of the year was not worth it and after requesting my order to be cancelled 0x , low and behold , i got my products delivered !
negative	they cost me more money than i earned since i had to pay extra shipping to rush my orders to my clients out of state to meet their deadline .
negative	i will never order from them again .
negative	shoes are excellent but i was not too pleased to have to send returns to sweden so i won_'_t shop online again .
negative	xwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww

negative	on dec 0nd i rec ' d this email - your giftcards . com order has_been confirmed and is now processing ( invoice #_000000 ) from giftcards . com .
negative	( my payment was quickly processed .)
negative	in the email it stated that it usually only took a few hours to process and i would be notified when shipped .
negative	it is now dec_00th and i '_ve had no other contact other than a request to complete this rating ... sad b /_c i had great hopes when i learned about the site ...
negative	this was a horrible experience !
negative	over s week to receive my cat_food , then it was delivered to an empty house ( not mine ) and would have laid there if a neighbor had not seen it .
negative	i will never purchase from this company again nor recommend it !
negative	i order parts for my vehicle '_s fan motor .
negative	partsgeek charged me , then two_days_later , canceled my order without telling_me why .
negative	when i look for parts on the web , i now steer_clear of partsgeek . com .
negative	i used to love shopping here , fun shoes .
negative	everything is fine if the order goes right , but if anything goes_wrong with the order , you ' re in for some fun .
negative	you will never wait less then an_hour just to talk to someone .
negative	if you don_'_t like the shoes or they don_'_t fit , you have to call and wait an_hour just to get permission to send them back .
negative	they tell you your credit will be applied automatically , it '_s not .
negative	another hour on the phone .

negative	watch out .
negative	i clicked one star because the product arrived as fast as the excremental
negative	i did nit receive a confirmation or receipt that my stay was booked .
negative	i made other arrangements for lodging .
negative	i best not get charged
negative	i never received the order
negative	this company allowed me to buy a product that they didn_'_t even have in stock .
negative	i had to contact them 0 days after i ordered to ask " when " they planned on shipping it .
negative	then they told me they didn_'_t even have the product , and would ship it when they received it !
negative	they offered a poor solution for me ;
negative	- wait_until they got a shipment of the b complex i ordered .
negative	- or just go_ahead ahead and cancel the order !
negative	they obviously didn_'_t care .
negative	that '_s really poor customer_service .
negative	my roommate ordered from them and 0 days_later they hadn_'_t even shipped his product .

negative	don_'_t waste your time and money with this site .
negative	i just tried to book a room in thailand for one night ( oct 0 , 0000 ) - when the confirmation_email came , another date was on it ( tomorrow !!)
negative	i checked and re - checked before i gave credit_card information .
negative	when i tried to cancel ( immediately ) as in -- within one minute of receiving confirmatiuon - which was two minutes after booking ( literally ), the website said i would be charged the entire amount since i had a non_- refundable ticket .
negative	what a scam !!
negative	im furious and im taking this up with my credit_card company !!!!!!!!!
negative	!
negative	picture i ordered arrived quickly not worth the money even at 00_percent_off really poor quality and workmanship so do not waste your money
negative	won_'_t do_business there because of the customer_service .
negative	i am still battling with customer_service to receive the correct refund from my returned order .
negative	definitely do not shop_here , as they don_'_t even know how to follow their own return_policy !
negative	one of their policies states that if you returned an order that ends_up falling below the $_000 free_shipping offer , then they will deduct 0 . 00 from your refund ( adding to the fact that you paid for the return shipping yourself ).
negative	which is all well and good , if the returned order is < 000 right ?
negative	but , my order is clearly above that amount , but after_contacting customer_service repeatedly , only to have different representatives repeat that same policy to me without_any explanation , they still refuse to give the full credit .
negative	and a warning to other shoppers who are undeterred by negative remarks : they also don_'_t offer refunds , they only offer yesstyle credit .
negative	so even if i hate the company , which i most certainly do and will make certain none of my friends shop there , i have to buy something from them to get my money back .
negative	their inflexible return_policy is only meant to protect themselves at the expense of the customer .
negative	update_: customer_service has gotten back to me stating that because i returned my entire order , my original order amount has_become $ 0 , which is below the $_000 requirement .
negative	this logic simply baffles me .
negative	if my original order has_become $ 0 for returning my purchase , then why did they even refund a portion of my order ?
negative	by their logic , i don_'_t have any credit with them , yet they refunded my order -$_00 , meaning i do have credit from the order .
negative	bogus company , bogus policies .
negative	didn_'_t even get past the registration stage ......
negative	added items to my basket - the 0 for 0 on swimwear - said all items were in stock - got to the payment stage and the final amount looked too much , was then informed that one of my items actually wasn_'_t in stock so i needed to find something_else - ok , did that - but then there was a notification saying that i wasn_'_t allowed a mixture of cash account and credit account - i thought i had opened a credit account becuase i wanted to use the £_00 voucher - phoned ther customer_services and was told that i needed to call back tomorrow to open a credit account or pay for items over the phone but i couldn_'_t use the voucher and she couldn_'_t amend my account - and you can '_t use the £_00 voucher if you pay for the goods in full .
negative	if i could give this company 0 out of 0 i probably would ..... won_'_t be completing my order with isme .
negative	received product faulty upon_opening .
negative	poorly manufactured quality .
negative	splintered joins , gaps in joins , looks like a year 0 woodwork project !
negative	awaiting a response from a hopeful and polite customer_services member
negative	i placed on order on dec . 00 , by the 00th i still hadn_'_t seen it so i emailed customer_service to find out why .
negative	they told me i had the wrong zip_code so i gave it to them again .
negative	they didn_'_t even both to contact tell me there was a problem they finally sent it out on the 00th and now won_'_t arrive until after christmas .
negative	i should have just ordered from my usual place at_least it would have been here on time .

negative	after using paypal to conduct a sales transaction my account was blocked due to a ' security risk ' even_though the party i sold the items to was perfectly happy with the transaction and received the items on time with no_issues whatsoever .
negative	when i tried to find out what the issue was i never received a satisfactory answer and to date -- 0 years later -- i am still blocked from using paypal .
negative	i know several people who are equally frustrated with paypal customer_service and i wouldn_'_t recommend them to anyone .
negative	please do not use expedia to conduct your transactions !
negative	save your money , your time , and your sanity by going through a different agency .

negative	i bought an airline_ticket , bought the travel_insurance , and was able to gain a credit from the airline when i cancelled .
negative	however , expedia , would not refund me the money and told me that their policy does not match the airline policy .
negative	0 .
negative	i spoke to several supervisors who all provided me with ficticious first names and would not offer their last names .
negative	they told me that i did not know how to read and next time to read more closely ( quite insulting ).
negative	0 .
negative	the representatives at expedia are trained to follow a script and if you have a question they cannot answer , they will tell you to call back at a later time ( this is after being on hold for 00_minutes ).
negative	never received goods , told after 0_weeks of waiting to go to my local postal depot as my £_00 . 00 parcel could be there .
negative	( it was not there ) after many emails to the company some which were not even answered i am now going to take my complant further .
negative	it has_been over 0_weeks , no refund no parcel no apology no reply to my last 0 emails !
negative	!
negative	i moved out of the unit on the 0th day of the month and i basically paid for 00 days for an empty unit .
negative	when i called the store the lady told me they only give refunds if you move out before the 0th day .
negative	which is stupid !
negative	i shouldn_'_t have to pay for something i '_m not going to use !!!!
negative	i will never use public store again !
negative	ordered phone and paid on 0 / 00 / 00 ... still_waiting to receive .
negative	i have emailed and can '_t get an actual shipping date from them .
negative	i received some tracking_number that doesn_'_t work and when i emailed them about it they told me it '_s a signature confirmation shipment and the tracking_number won_'_t show anything until order is received .
negative	i have now called them and left message .
negative	at this point , i would rather have my money back and i will buy elsewhere .
negative	i have bought things from overseas before with faster shipping and better communication than this .
negative	i ordered 0 pair of open toe pumps .
negative	both size 0 .
negative	one pair i could fit_perfectly , but when i say hurt my feet .
negative	i swear the blood stop flowing .
negative	my feet are still in pain and it '_s been 0 days since i wore them .
negative	and oh my god ...
negative	they were not stable at all .
negative	when i was walking i twisted my ankle and the worse then that i was going down some stairs and almost fell down the stair from the heels not being stable .
negative	so i thought it was me .
negative	i just tried them back on , and the pain shot up my right leg and i was not able to stand on my leg with my foot on the ground and once again , the heel was not stable .
negative	i almost twisted my ankle again just standing there .
negative	now the 0nd pair i purchase , the size 0 was like a size 0 .
negative	i was not able to put them on my feet at all .
negative	i called customer_service and request for rma .
negative	advised me i was not able to return due to 00_%_off coupon_code i used and the shoes were on sale .
negative	i asked if i could at_least exchange for a 0 . 0 since it was still available .
negative	the rep told me , no .
negative	i was not even able to exchange .
negative	i pretty_much was stuck with a shoe i could not fit .
negative	no customer_service skills what '_s so ever .
negative	didn_'_t even_bother to see if i wanted to place another order .
negative	she could have cared less if i had a special event i order the pumps for .
negative	so guess what , they shoes are still wrapped in the package i purchased them in and in the same box delivered and sitting in my garage .
negative	what a waste of money !!!
negative	yea the shoes may have been $_00 . 00 with 00_%_off , but it '_s my money and i don_'_t like not being_able to enjoy what i spend $ 0 . 00 on .
negative	so i will never shop at amiclubwear . com anymore .
negative	nor will i advise anyone_else .
negative	customer_service stinks , very , very poor !!
negative	f f f f for failure , failed , unfriendly , and unfair !
negative	i am really disappointed .
negative	i was referred to them by a mutual friend .
negative	but what can i say .
negative	i '_m stuck with shoes i paid $_00 and doing nothing with them !
negative	what i don_'_t like , someone_else will !
negative	that '_s how they still in business .
negative	but the not exchanging part i don_'_t understand !
negative	i ordered a golf ball display rack in december_0000 .
negative	i ordered , paid and waited for the parcel to arrive .
negative	once it has arrived it was damaged .
negative	i took pictures of the damaged parcel and sent it to the lady at the office named [_name ].
negative	she asked if the parcel / box was damaged on the outside .
negative	i told her it wasn_'_t , and that i wouldn_'_t recommend great golf_memories , and also wouldn_'_t buy from them again .
negative	i understand that the company cannot take_responsibility once it has left the states , but i went to personally pick_up the parcel at the post_office and it wasn_'_t damaged .
negative	it clearly comes down to quality control in the warehouse / stock room .
negative	it doesn_'_t matter now , i don_'_t want anything as i had to get someone here in sa to fix the shelves and repair the glass as well as the " wood " which was damaged .
negative	my husband finally got his present , and this was an expensive lesson_learnt as it was the first time i ever ordered anything from overseas .

negative	we reserved a king_room and when we got to hotel they had our reservation as 0 queens .
negative	i asked more than once on the phone to make_sure it was a king_bed in our room !
negative	sounded_like the agent on the line was in a different country and line was very hard to hear .
negative	terribly long phone_call and i would never recommend this reservation line to anyone !
negative	it was our anniversary and very special weekend for us !!!!
negative	!
negative	now , i get hung_up on ( twice0 when i call to talk to someone and they say they can '_t help me !
negative	bull ** it !!!!!
negative	i keep calling and no one answer the 000 numbers now !
negative	lovely !
negative	we had to stay at hotel as it was 0 pm and we were out of options at that point .
negative	i had booked a room that slept 0 people .
negative	at the time of booking it was just 0_adults and 0 child but it then changed to 0_adults and 0 child .
negative	i called customer_service as a courtesy to add the 0rd adult .
negative	this would in no way change the type of room i had originally_booked which slept 0 people .
negative	the customer_service rep wanted to charge me more stating that when i booked the room i paid a lesser price then what the room currently went for .
negative	why am i being charged like its a new reservation i '_m simply adding a 0rd person to a room that sleeps 0 ?
negative	if we had been adding more people then the room slept then obviously i ' d expect an up charge at the current rate to completely change the room .
negative	not to mention that i had checked the rates just prior to calling and they were actually less_than what i had originally paid .
negative	the rep continued to argue with me about the price so i had her cancel the reservation in which i have to wait for a refund .
negative	i had to re - book my reservation myself in which i ultimately paid less_than when i originally_booked but remember the rep was trying to charge me more .
negative	this is all around terrible customer_service that instead of just assisting_me and adding a name to the book she caused more of a headache .
negative	i will never use bookit . com again and i will see that others know they will try to screw you over .
negative	don_'_t bother calling customer_service instead do their job for them .
negative	sent the wrong damn part , it was 0 days late and the best part ... it was sent in a 0ft box !!!!!
negative	!
negative	worst_experience ever !!
negative	hotel did not have our reservation .
negative	after an_hour in the phone , travelocity finally faxes the reservation , the hotel cannot accomodate us for the full vacation !
negative	we had to stay at the hotel for 0 nights and find another hotel for the remainder of our stay !
negative	after 0 hours and 00 phone_calls we are still_waiting for someone to call back from travelocity to refund us for the nights we the hotel doesn_'_t have space for us .
negative	luckily we had cash or we would be stranded after thinking we paid already !
negative	!
negative	i would not recommend this company to anyone .
negative	they lied to me .
negative	they told me that i could pay for my motel when i arrived at the motel .
negative	well they went_ahead with out my permission and charged my card .
negative	now i have bounce fee '_s and they will not work with me on this .
negative	they said what is done is done .
negative	please do not make reservations with this company .
negative	i am reporting this company to the bbb .
negative	i called the 000 # and spoke to diego .
negative	i explained to him that my family of 0 was traveling to st louis .
negative	we had a hard time finding a room w_/ 0 beds to accommodate the 0 of us .
negative	he found us an airport holiday_inn .
negative	perfect !!
negative	except when we arrive , he only noted 0 guests so we were not given the breakfast coupons for all 0 .
negative	nor did we get the rollout bed we were promised ( unless we wanted to pay extra ).
negative	the hotel basically said we ' d have to call " expedia " to work it out .
negative	problem with that is i had not called expedia .
negative	i called the 000 # at the top of the website .
negative	in the booking process diego was kind of pushy .
negative	telling_me i better book this room now or we ' d miss out .
negative	i was googling reviews to make_sure it was a nicer hotel .
negative	i wouldn_'_t use this service ever again .
negative	but it will be tough to discern since apparently i had no_idea i was being routed to a 0rd_party reservation service from a hotels actual website .
negative	as previous .
negative	i decided to use parts_geek after a coworker recommended it .
negative	i was impressed by the quick delivery but that all went out the window when i saw the part .
negative	it didnt match the brand_name i ordered , i got sent a ' chassis rite ' part after ordering a ' mevotech ' brand part .
negative	it looked like it had been broken in half at one point and not very skillfully welded back on , it was crooked and looked used .
negative	i tried to see about exchanging it for another and i got told i am responsible for 00_% restocking_fee , the shipping to send it back and that i would have to do a complete return and buy it again .
negative	was also clued into the fact it can take up to 00 days to get a refund of my $.
negative	i think that is rediculous considering it wasnt an_issue on my end they sent me a faulty part that never should have been on their shelf , online it said the condition was new and this was deffinately rebuilt .
negative	no wonder_why this site sells parts so cheap !
negative	i ordered a jackmanii clematis that arrived with a broken stem so i had only just the bottom part of the clematis which i planted but it does not look good .
negative	i paid $_00 . oo + for this and even if it survives i do not think i should have to pay this much for a plant now that i could buy at a store for less_than $_00 . 00 .
negative	they wanted me to send them a picture which i do not
negative	have the capable of doing so they said sorry we can not do anything .
negative	i will not be ordering from these people again .
negative	i only wish i had read these reviews before purchasing from this company , as i can relate to all of the negative_reviews .
negative	i have never , in my entire life , dealt_with a more unprofessional company nor one with worse customer_service !
negative	they clearly just want to take customer '_s money and don_'_t care about repeat business .
negative	whatever you do , do not buy from amiclubwear !!
negative	!
negative	i received the order and the bag of dog_food that is versus for weight_management for my one dog was not included .
negative	i need someone to resolve this or i will take it to court .
negative	it is really horrible that i have to waste my time dealing_with this .
negative	please get back to me as soon as possible .
negative	marianne pavlovitz
negative	not much more to say than i ordered these for a special_occasion for my sister and it '_s been two_days and no sign of any flowers .
negative	i had a very bad_experience with golfstore europe .
negative	in my opinion they take orders online for stock they don_'_t have and then ask you days_later to pick something_else .
negative	they are very slow responding to emails and very slow for delivering .
negative	i ordered 0 items on 00th may , neither were in stock .
negative	i picked one in another colour and requested a refund for the other .
negative	in the end i went through paypal for my refund .
negative	it was 0_weeks_later that i received the item .
negative	this is the 0nd time this happened to me .
negative	will never shop with them again
negative	be very very careful booking from this website .
negative	in my case they advertised one hotel but the reservation confirmation was for another lower profile cheap hotel from the same chain .
negative	firstly the customer_service guy tried to persuade me the hotel listed in the confirmation is the same one i wanted , then after realising they made a mistake on the website blamed me for misreading the advert and refused to refund in full .
negative	next_day the issue on the website was fixed and still they don_'_t accept there was an_issue .
negative	can clearly see it on google chached pages though ...
negative	the cancellation_policy said i could cancel by 00 feb when the booking was made on 00th leaving me negative amount of days to cancel ...
negative	rubbish !
negative	still can '_t get my money back !
negative	i '_ve purchased " steamer buddy " from wowcher but wasn_'_t satisfied with the product , so decided to return it .
negative	i contacted wowcher customer_service and they came back to me saying they were going to contact the seller .
negative	weeks past but nothing happened , no responce from neither wowcher nor the seller .
negative	i tried to contact them couple more times but all my emails were ignored .
negative	another example of poor service was recently when i couldn_'_t book the appointment with the service provider and hence wanted to transfer the money to voucher credit .
negative	no luck contacting wowcher customer_services team .
negative	bought three tickets for the who at the o0 , each costing £_000 . 00 each .
negative	was totally pissed off when the tickets arrived showing face value of £_00 . 00 each .
negative	disgusting to be ripped_off like this , this was more than double the price of the tickets .
negative	due to weather circumstances ( the winter_storm that came through ), i was not able to make my trip .
negative	the hotel manager called to confirm it was ok to cancel and travelocity said there was some discrepancy .
negative	after saying they would look into it and give me feedback within 0 business days , i never_heard from them again .
negative	every attempt to call has led to constant transfers that usually leads nowhere .
negative	terrible customer_service .
negative	i will never book through_travelocity again .
negative	upon return from my flight ( delayed_due to weather ) i was a few hours late .
negative	i called to let them know to make_sure i wouldn_'_t have to pay for an extra day or overages .
negative	being a frequent traveler , this has happened several_times and previously they have been great .
negative	they said as long as i returned on the same return day on my contract , i was fine .
negative	well upon_arrival , they charged me a full extra day taxes and all .
negative	i was really upset and they refused to let_me off property until i paid it .
negative	i have called several_times to speak to a manager and no one has ever called me back .
negative	i will never park here again .
negative	fyi they did this as well to the 0 other people behind me .
negative	lying thieves .
negative	unacceptable , such a scam .
negative	take me by my word , never ever trust this site !!
negative	they lie and swindle you out of your money .
negative	they take the amount off your card , and when you arrive to the hotel you supposedly booked , there is no reservation to be found .
negative	considering they don_'_t have a working phone_number for you to call , you are pretty_much out of luck at that point .
negative	you can email them , but they never get back to you .
negative	so , they have your money and your are left to scrape up extra_cash you may not have ( which was the case with my experience ) to attempt to find a reasonable hotel that isn_'_t absolutely disgusting , and are left to eat $ 0 pizzas for the weekend .
negative	thank_you olotels for ruining my vacation !
negative	i thought i was on the web_site for ramada_inn and these people tricked me into thinking i was .
negative	i would never have made the reservation through them if i had known they were a third_party .
negative	reservations made this way are impossible to change or upgrade so i ' d have left the site had they not been deceitful .
negative	these sites are horrible , horrible choices and i '_ll never make the mistake again .
negative	i figured_out what i did wrong .
negative	i found a really nice shirt on the superdry website for my boyfriends_birthday .
negative	he was really pleased with the shirt , but when he tried it on he found the xxl a little tight .
negative	as he loved the style we decided to take a trip to brighton to exchange it for a larger_size .
negative	once in the shop we were unable to find the xxxl size so we enquired whether we would be able to order this size from the website again instead .
negative	the shop assistant seemed helpful and looked to accertain whether the website supplied this size only to relay to us that superdry did not sell xxxl .
negative	after much dissapointment he managed to find another item to exchange for the shirt for .
negative	once home i decided to check the website only to find that the informaiton the shop assistant gave_us was incorrect which left me feeling lied to and cheated .
negative	this has made me question my loyalty to the brand and i am unsure_whether i will purchase from superdry .
negative	this is a real_shame as i have such a loyal_customer in the past .
negative	ik_heb voor_een veteraan , die met zijn verjaardag in het ziekenhuis lag , namens een veteranen stichting het bouquet " spetterend oranje " gekocht .
negative	ik begrijp heus dat_de_bloemen niet precies zoals afgebeeld staan , maar had toch wel iets van oranje in het bouquet verwacht .
negative	in plaats daarvan werd er een roze bouquet met wat rode ballen gestuurd .
negative	heb daarna de bloemist geschreven , en gezegt dat_ik het bouquet vrouwelijk vond en heel ongepast voor_een veteraan .
negative	heb echter verder alleen radio stilte ontvangen , en absoluut geen antwoord gehad .
negative	wij hebben 0000 leden en zal ook uw bedrijf op_de veteranen site vernoemen om_te vermijden
negative	do not think i would use them again unless i was desprate .
negative	not personal enough for me .
negative	i would give them a negative rating .
negative	i was not happy that my interest_rate for borrowing $_000 went from paying $_000 . 00 per_month for three_months the first time ; to paying $_000 . 00 for the same loan amount .
negative	i '_m working hard to pay this off early as the fees this time amount to usury .
negative	i will never borrow from you again , because the interest changed from the first time i borrowed to a greater amount , only three_months later .
negative	this is a bit like loan sharking .
negative	i bought a set of 0 armani pants from this company and when i received them the packaging was badly_damaged .
negative	the item was meant to be a gift so i checked to see if the description mentioned anything about damaged box - nothing .
negative	so i contacted the company by e_- mail and waited .
negative	0_weeks_later still no response i contacted them again and called and still nothing .
negative	i have now contacted them 0 times and not one reply back !
negative	the item is still unused and in it '_s box with tags and i am so annoyed .
negative	the number they give is obviously just a ploy to make you think they are a legit company but they never ever pick_up - just a guy saying " we are busy this time of year ".
negative	i suspect the item is a fake and now will have to take this further .
negative	please keep your money and shop somewhere reputable - i will from now on as it '_s not worth the risk .
negative	update_: thank_you for replying to my complaint .
negative	i find it strange that you had the time to reply to this and not to the several messages through your site and email on invoice over the past 0 months !
negative	as mentioned on your website i need a ' code ' of some_sort before i can send it back to you .
negative	there was no returns info sent with item .
negative	i have also read some other customer complaints and one mentioned they returned their item and had not received refund hence_why i am reluctant just send item as i spent £_00 !
negative	plus , will i receive the money to send them back as none of this is actually my fault ?
negative	as mentioned on your website if the item is damaged then you will refund in full .
negative	yes , the underwear is not damaged ( i haven_'_t actually checked ) but it '_s a gift and the box has a massive hole in it !!!
negative	!
negative	i am happy to send them back if i get a full_refund ( including the money to send back which will be recorded as i have no faith in your customer_service .)
negative	if all does go well then i will consider changing my rating and review .
negative	but for now i feel it is important for other customers to be aware of your customer care - which is appalling .
negative	plus , i think you will find tags can be faked .
negative	i said i suspected the item to be because once you buy an item from iwantpants . com it is virtually_impossible to get in touch for returns or complaints .
negative	i will be sending the item back once i get confirmation of refund .
negative	thank_you .
negative	messed_up my reservation .. nothing was about it .
negative	after_speaking to someone for over a half an_hour , i was promised a better deal but did not get one !!!!
negative	! i will never book through ya '_ll again !!!
negative	!
negative	i booked a hotel on priceline that was a 0 . 0 * hotel .
negative	after they accepted my bid and charged my credit_card , i found out this hotel was not a 0 . 0 * hotel .
negative	the hotel has bed_bugs , barking dogs in the rooms , broken tv , stopped up toilets and the swimming_pool is under_construction .
negative	they charge a 00 . 00 per day resort_fee in addition to the room rate .
negative	i contacted customer sevice to see it they would change hotel and they told me there was nothing they could do .
negative	unbelievable !!!
negative	i will never use priceline again ..,
negative	i will never be having anything sent with fedex again there costumer_service is beyond rude and not helpful plus you will never get your package on time .
negative	my estimated shipping date kept changing they received my package on the 00nd of may but i didn_'_t get it untl june 0rd i '_ve seriously had shipping faster from japan !
negative	the only place i will even trust with my stuff again is ups i '_ve never once had a problem with them and they actually keep you updated on your mail !
negative	i really had a hardtime making my purchase as a first time customer which i end up cancelling my orders .
negative	im hoping you could provide a better and easier way of purchasing your products like what other online stores do .
negative	i tried to order a gift_card for my dad and was a first time shopper .
negative	they declined my purchase because i was a first time buyer from the site and also because i didn_'_t want to sign_up an account .
negative	it took over 00_hours to find out my dad wasn_'_t getting his gift_card i picked out for his_birthday .
negative	what a disappointment clear reason to never attempt to shop with ever again .
negative	when i went to check in there was no record of the reservation .
negative	i had the confirmation number , i had the email but the manger couldn_'_t find my reservation .
negative	he called somewhere starwood office , there was nothing .
negative	the manager informed me i was using a third_party and there was no reservation , that the hotel was full , the i would be paying a higher_rate then what i receive online .
negative	will not be using this hotel again
negative	.
negative	i own a dell desktop and i love it , however , i bought it from walmart ...
negative	they helped_me tremendously when i ran_into problems with it .
negative	soooo , i decided to purchase a laptop directly from dell for my neice .
negative	i ordered over the phone & found that everything & i do mean everything is sold separately !!!
negative	for that reason alone , i will never order fom them again .
negative	i didn_'_t feel we got the best quality having to do it that way .
negative	next time , i will go back to a local_store .
negative	i purchased an e_- book for my class and it downloaded and they charged me , however , it refused to open ... needless to say , i won_'_t do that again ...
negative	i had to go back to amazon to order to i could get my work done .
negative	after countless phone_calls and ignored emails , i finally received my order today !!!
negative	exactly 00 days after i ordered it !
negative	i '_m just happy i got it & didn_'_t get got ... lol
negative	i did not recieve my last full order .
negative	i called and spoke to someone , he said part of it was on backorder ... ok , thanks for letting_me know eventually about that and that he would send the rest out .
negative	still_haven_'_t recieved it .
negative	i know you '_ve had some troubles with hurricane_sandy etc but still ... don_'_t charge my credit_card if you don_'_t have the stuff to send !
negative	or at_least let a person know you are out and will need to reorder .
negative	i will nto be ordering from your company again .
negative	i am a customer for years and have had no trouble until now .
negative	trip id 000000000000 should have been under my blueyedoe @_gmail . com account .
negative	somehow , you created a whole other account for me calling it blueyedoe @_gmail . com0 .
negative	i asked for the accounts to be merged and you said no .
negative	cancelling my trip with you .
negative	orderd furnature and paid for bed , headboard , frame , dresser , mirror , shitake couch and ottoman i waited a month for some one to call me to send my things i called them and they told me another 0weeks !
negative	i finally received everything but the ottoman they said another week to come in now
negative	after four weeks i call them and was told there manager was going out of town and wouldn_'_t approve of any ordering and it would be another 0_weeks i paid in full at the time i orderd how dare they steal my money !
negative	a man told me that i would recieve a 00 . 00 credit and free delivery but they still have my ottoman i told the man i '_m giving him til the 00th and i want all my money back i '_m very shocked at the unprofessionalism
negative	my wheel was suppose to be here on wednesday .
negative	on monday the tracking showed it in commerce city colorado , and i am located in fruita colorado .
negative	by wednesday my package was shipped to tenessee and is now located in kansas .
negative	by the time it shows i am suppose to recieve my wheel it will have been 0_weeks since the wheel shipped out .
negative	i am running on a spare .
negative	i am disappointed on the outcome of this order .
negative	i hope sincerly that i do not recieve the product damaged .
negative	never thought it would be this big of an_issue to be delievered .
negative	i hope monday it actually arrives .
negative	hi .
negative	i had paid the additional fee for flowers to be delivered before one pm .
negative	i was very disappointed they were delivered too late at four pm a nd won_'_t be us ingthe vcompany again
negative	i ordered business cards on00 / 00 / 00 from the wolverhampton branch and am still_waiting .
negative	i left an answerphone message asking for a call relating to the order which was never returned .
negative	when i finally spoke to rob i was promised a callback within 00_mins which did not happen .
negative	i sent an_email_asking if someone would have the courtesy to contact me to discuss when i could expect my order .
negative	it has not been returned ; they simply ignore requests to communicate and i still do not have my order .
negative	not a company i will be using again .
negative	i ordered a toilet_seat which was very expensive for my children as my 0 year_old_son kept falling in as he is just 0 . this one was supposed to be bigger and have a wider seat as it is a " throne " seat .
negative	i received it and a couple of weeks_later opened it once we had some time over christmas to fit it .
negative	as soon as i took it out of the box it was clear it would never fit a normal toilet so i replaced it , resealed it in a box within a box marked fragile and paid for it to be retuned special delivery as requested by fountain .
negative	at the time i returned it , fountain said they would have to knock off £_00 as we had not returned it within 00 days and i reluctantly accepted that .
negative	however having paid £_000 for the seat and £_00 for the postage , i was told by fountain that it had arrived damaged so they would not receive it back and about 0_weeks_later it was returned to me .
negative	i have no_idea how they believe that this could have occurred when the toilet_seat was not even fully removed when i originally received it as i saw immediately that it was the wrong back sitting ( which was never clear or stated on the website that it needed a special victorian style toilet ) and i do not believe it was damaged at my end at all , they simply did not want to refund it .
negative	iit was returned fully packaged , in the box , in another box and marked fragile .
negative	i will not be back to this company .
negative	rubbish customer_service ... non_existent ... product arrived smashed and they refuse to honour the sale of goods act saying their terms and conditions take priority .
negative	this is not only illegal but has_been defined as a criminal act by my solicitor .
negative	we are taking them to a small claims court now .
negative	they won_'_t respond to emails , letters .... don_'_t use them .
negative	purchased an order from topshop last_week .
negative	was told delivery would have arrived no later than wednesday 00th_april .
negative	recieved an sms from hermes on monday 00nd to say my parcel was with my local courier and would be with me within 0 days .
negative	on tuesday 00rd status was updated as ' not delivered '.
negative	tried to contact hermes to see what exactly that meant .
negative	firstly , their webchat function wasn_'_t working and on closer inspection of webchat times they are as follows ; monday - saturday closed sunday 00 : 00 am - 00 :_00am ??
negative	much use that is !
negative	also their email option guarantees a 00 hour response .
negative	0 days_later and i have still heard_nothing .
negative	my delivery status has still not changed from the ' not delivered ' status .
negative	unreliable , unprofessional service !
negative	one part they sent was for the wrong car .
negative	i tried to contact them to send it back for the right part but i had no luck at all contacting them by phone , fax or even e_- mail .
negative	the customer_service number was automated , hung_up on me twice after being on hold for 00_minutes .
negative	i called back again and waited for more than a hour and still nothing .
negative	i even attemped fax and e_- mail with still no luck after 0 days --- i just gave up and took my business elsewhere .
negative	i found sixt via one of those priceline type sites and went directly to the site to rent a car for a trip to the uk .
negative	when i arrived to stansted_airport ( 00_minutes early ) they weren_'_t ready with a vehicle , so i had to wait for an_hour .
negative	it was an annoyance , but that was ok .
negative	when they were ready , i picked_up the car .
negative	they asked me if i wanted an upgrade .
negative	i '_ve been offered free upgrades before ( because of available vehicle stock ) but they never told me the cost of the upgrade .
negative	then they literally just handed me the keys and sent me on my way .
negative	the personnel at the rental office didn_'_t inspect the vehicle with me or give me any introduction to the car ( it would have been nice for them to at_least offer me a quick tutorial on how to use the gps , since i ' d never been in the car before and i '_m from the usa and driving in a different country .
negative	i spent 00_minutes just figuring that out ).
negative	the car itself was flawless .
negative	i returned the vehicle at the end of the trip and they charged my credit_card for the rental .
negative	sounds great , right ?
negative	great car , great price , middle of the road customer_service ?
negative	i can live with that , right ?
negative	still all considering , i ' d have used them again .
negative	but four days_later i get a bill for " tire damage " for $_000 via an_email .
negative	i '_m now in a foreign_country , have no way to dispute the claim .
negative	i have no knowledge of any tire damage or any event that could have caused this damage , but i did not inspect the tires before or after renting the car , and no one inspected the car with me prior to leaving , or returning to stansted_airport .
negative	that all considered , i decided to just pay the damage claim , write their customer_service and email about my experience and move on .
negative	it '_s not worth my time or money to dispute it .
negative	so i responded with payment via the form they asked for and waited for them to withdrawal the money .
negative	they never withdrew the money from my account , but continue to send me reminder_emails asking for payment .
negative	the last one threatening legal_action , so i called the uk offices .
negative	no voicemail , and no one answering the phones .
negative	so i called the american sixt offices .
negative	they were very helpful , giving me the direct email address to the person sending me the damage request emails .
negative	after sending her an_email , they finally they withdrew the funds from my account .
negative	the rental ended 0 - 00 and this fiasco ended on 0 - 00 .
negative	i regularly travel to the uk , and i '_ll never use them again .
negative	i ' d be willing to try us sixt , because they were so helpful in resolving this issue , but not in the uk .
negative	horrible customer_service , horrible experience all around
negative	i ordered a pair of red shoes in september .
negative	when they arrived , they were pink .
negative	so they said they would correct the issue .
negative	once again , they sent me pink .
negative	so they said they ' d send the correct ones .
negative	now i '_m being told that the red ones are out of stock .
negative	and yet , when you go on their website , i can order those shoes still !!
negative	!
negative	in the mean time , my wedding is in 0_weeks & my dress has_been altered for these shoes that they are lying to me & telling_me i can '_t have .
negative	i will never order from them again !!
negative	!
negative	i read a bunch of horrible reviews on this company , but for the price of the part i wanted i decided to take a gamble .
negative	i only wanted one small part , how can someone mess that up ?
negative	well they did .
negative	sent me a part to a completely different car .
negative	i am not even going to try and get refunded because of the horror_stories i read about people dealing_with their customer_service .
negative	i will just get more angry .
negative	don_'_t bother with this company ... garbage .
negative	on the 00th of december i ordered an item for christmas for my dad , i recieved an_email_saying they have recieved my order but it was waiting rewiew from paypal , on the 00th_december the status hadn_'_t changed so i sent them a request using the form under contact us , i have yet to recieve a reply , i checked my paypal_account on the 00th_december only to learn that the money was taken out on the 00th , i promptly added this information to my other request , as you can already guess i still_haven_'_t had a reply , i would call them but nowhere on the site is there a phone_number , there are now only 0 postal days to christmas so it looks like my dad isn_'_t going to the christmas_present i wanted for him , as you can imagine i am very very angry
negative	my good friend ( also a mechanic ) and i ordered a few parts and paid_extra to have them sent overnight to my house .
negative	we did so on thursday but did not see the fine_print that there were no deliveries on saturday .
negative	the " overnighted " parts arrived monday_afternoon and i had to extend my rental_car agreement a few_days , costing me another $_000 .
negative	when i called the only number that i could find for them ( on a blog bc there is nothing available online in terms of a phone_number ), i was told that " there was nothing he could do " because he was in sales .
negative	when i persisted , he assured_me i would get a call on monday to reimburse_me for the $ spent for the expedited_shipping .
negative	no call .
negative	never using them again .
negative	i guess i have to go log in to my credit_card account to view dollar values .
negative	very strange .
negative	hotel couldn_'_t give me any detail either .
negative	adds another stage to my process , is inconvenient , i won_'_t use bookit again .
negative	fatalna obsługa !
negative	zamówiłam sukienkę i okazało się , że jest podarta .
negative	stwierdziłam , że w takiej sytuacji już jej nic chce , wiec ją odesłałam .
negative	do tej pory nie dostałam zwrotu pieniędzy :/
negative	i don_'_t know why anyone uses these people .
negative	worst reliability i have ever_seen .
negative	when i went on site to view the marriot hotel in hartsville , sc to book a reservation , i though that i would be talking to a marriott rep .
negative	the person never identified that he was from some other company .
negative	anyway , as we went through the reservation process , i asked that my marriott rewards numbers be put on the reservation .
negative	i was told then that i was not talking to marriott , but to a booking_agency and that the rewards number could not be put on the reservation .
negative	so i opted to say that i would call marriot to reserve the room .
negative	before i could get that number , my phone rang and the gentleman said , " my supervisor said that we can put the rewards number on the reservation ", so i proceeded with the reservation .
negative	when i got to the hotel , the rewards number was not on the reservation .
negative	also , the rep did not make it clear that my card was charged up front .
negative	not that it was a problem , he just didn_'_t make_sure that i understood that process .
negative	it so sad that we will do anything these days to get a sale or get business .
negative	the rep name was zack .
negative	we had a business conference and shipped all our printing over using ni_parcels .
negative	when we got there 0 day before the event we saw that our parcel had been ' re packaged ' and 00_% of our documents were wrecked .
negative	we were in a remote part of northern_ireland on st patrick '_s day weekend ... so we had to have the hotel re print all of our documents .
negative	the printing had foot prints on it , crumpled and ripped .
negative	if a box breaks i can understand but what is unforgivable is someone knew about it and could have made contact with us to let us know .
negative	we were put in a very embarrassing position which could have been avoided .
negative	vetting new shipping companies in time for our next conference .
negative	the web_site is easy to access and follow and you get your supplies within a week .
negative	i will go to them whenever supplies are needed .... never had a problem
negative	an absolutely appalling company with little or no customer_service .
negative	i recently took delivery of a faulty electrical_appliance and in spite of 0 telephone_calls it has not been collected and replaced .
negative	i have now referred the matter to trading_standards .
negative	dont be scammed into purchasing travelocity '_s flight insurance .
negative	it is extremely difficult to change flights or get your money back regardless of the emergency .
negative	the customer_service is very poor with travelocity .
negative	they are extremely_rude and unhelpful .
negative	they kept telling_me to call the airline .
negative	then one calls the airline , and they tell you to call who you booked through .
negative	i didn_'_t save any money by booking through_travelocity .
negative	i booked throught them to utilize the flight insurance due to health_issues .
negative	however , this was a waste of time and money .
negative	bought a paddle board , they have all over the website free_shipping above $_00 . 00 but yet i was charged shipping , apparently in a disclaimer .
negative	they sent me the wrong board , so another person was given mine .
negative	then days_later it just showed_up , i had a competition i was in so i had to rent a board for the houses mistake .
negative	all i wanted was a refund in shipping and no one acknowledged me , so never got it .
negative	got a sappent watch in the order broke the first day !
negative	over it , horrible customer_service .
negative	on saturday , 00th of october , i purchased a ticket for the killers at the secc , at glasgow .
negative	i have yet to receive an_email indicating my ticket was shipped and the gig is in three_days !
negative	unless it is posted tommorow it won_'_t arrive on time and i paid 000 £ just to be sure i woulld have a ticket no_matter what !
negative	i have emailed viagogo twice , never got a response and when i called them i was told they would contact the seller and email me by the end of the day .
negative	still no email .
negative	i am panicking since i will travel all the way from athens to go to this gig !
negative	!
negative	orderid :_0000000
negative	update_: unbelievable !
negative	have spoken to three agents so_far , getting the same reply that they have to get in touch with a separate department in order to reach the seller -- by email !
negative	!
negative	they have emailed me back twice with the exact_same automated email on how they are working with the seller to ensure that i receive my ticket in time .
negative	they obviously never read my actual email !!!
negative	!
negative	i have never_experienced worse service in my life and i have bought various tickets for concerts abroad .
negative	steer_clear .
negative	i ordered a part , was sent the wrong one finally got it sent back after 0 months of correspondence can not speak to anyone , tried_calling no one answers .
negative	all i wanted was to fix my car and have had nothing good from from your end .
negative	your customer_service is non existant , you told me i need to learn how to speak with people you need to speak to people period .
negative	i want my full_refund back and i expect it now .
negative	you keep saying 00 - 00_hours well it '_s way beyond that .
negative	i am pissed !!!!
negative	i had to click a star for your rating , you don_'_t deserve any but had to click one .
negative	i placed an order for a 00_lb .
negative	bag of verus dog_food , a red kong squeak toy , a kong giraffe toy , and a kong monkey toy .
negative	i specifically advised that i did not want any deviation from my request , and if they could not honor my request , they were to delete that specific aspect of my order .
negative	i e_- mailed twice and called twice .
negative	i spoke with a young_woman and i spoke with a young male .
negative	neither of these two people told me that they could not provide me with my specific request .
negative	obviously , the pet_flow people did not have a red squeak toy , because they sent a blue one .
negative	they did not care that i had to have a red one .
negative	they sent any color that they chose for me to receive .
negative	their disregard for my needs created a real mess for me !
negative	i work night shift .
negative	i work from 0000 until 0000 , ( 0 :_00pm ‘ til 0 :_00am ).
negative	i had to stay up almost twenty - four hours to shop at local_pet_store to locate a red kong squeak toy .
negative	pet_stores do not open until 00am , so by the time i found a red kong squeak toy , drove home , and got in the bed , i only had three and one half hours to sleep before it was time to get up and go to work again .
negative	i shop on - line because i must .
negative	i have to make a living , and i make my living by working on thirteen - hour shifts at night .
negative	i don_’ t have the convenience of stopping to shop after work , as the only place open to shop is wal - mart .
negative	department_stores and specialty_stores , such as pet_stores , do not open until half of my sleep time is gone .
negative	i am extremely disappointed .
negative	i was unbelievably inconvenienced by the pet_flow company .
negative	drive time has taken money out of my bank_account , not once but twice .
negative	i paid $_000 of my down payment on my debit_card in november , they took out $_000 in december_0000 and in march_0000 .
negative	the first time it took a few_days to put the money back on my card .
negative	this time i have to wait on a check .
negative	dont_know why it changed .
negative	i had to go back and forth from my bank to the dealer , i got transferred from one department to the next .
negative	this happened on march_00th ... it is now april 0 and i still don_'_t have my cash .
negative	they mailed the first check to the wrong_address and as of today my check is still not in the mail .
negative	i ask for the inconvenience could i get a few free car washes or maybe a gas card , the operator act like she couldn_'_t_believe her ears .
negative	no was my answer .
negative	they said this happens alot in ohio .
negative	the dealer told me the problem was fixed in january . this is march .... and i have to borrow rent money because drive time took my cash .
negative	i bought a wowcher recently .
negative	i tried to use it .
negative	i contacted the merchant and got no reply to a telephone_call .
negative	the voucher expired i contacted customer_service as it wasn_'_t my fault and i '_m still_awaiting a reply speaks_volumes .
negative	i ordered some items back in september 00 .
negative	i sent them several e_- mails .
negative	according to the tracking_numbers they provided , my items were delivered in il and or .
negative	i live in ca .
negative	" alice " said she will look into it .
negative	i never received the items i ordered .
negative	now that i sent another e_- mail , their account is closed .
negative	their webpage it '_s also closed .
negative	total scam !!!
negative	!
negative	i have yet received my order yet i ordered on the 0 of may .
negative	when looking at facebook people who ordered after that day have received their order .
negative	i have called several_times with no answer .
negative	i have email several_times , with no answer .
negative	so at this pointn i do not a nice review at this time .
negative	too slow sending the free post envelope out , the payment for the phone was even slower , would not recommend ..........
negative	let '_s put a stop to their scamming .
negative	report them to the authorities .
negative	i will not be ordering again .
negative	our experience of this company was extremely disappointing .
negative	we certainly won_'_t be using them again and i have warned our friends nd acquaintances to avoid them too .
negative	in short , the products that we ordered ( dual fix stair gates ) were not as_described on the web_page and could not be fixed safely using the pressure mounting without drilling the pressure cups into the wall (!).
negative	we contacted the company to advise them of the issue and , although very polite and ' sorry for any inconvenience caused ' refused to allow us to return the gate that we had opened because the packaging was opened - although we couldn_'_t have found the problem any other way .
negative	they would take back the second , unopened gate , only if we paid a £_00 . 00 courier fee .
negative	we have been left with a gate that is of absolutely no use to us as well as being £_00 out of pocket for the privilege of bing able to return the other one .
negative	having just had twin girls we have one a great deal of on line shopping for baby products and have never had such a negative experience any where else .
negative	given the plethora of similar companies around i would advise you to look elsewhere and find one of the many
negative	other_firms that actually understand the concept of customer_satisfaction .
negative	they presented themselves as the hotel itself instead of a booking agent .
negative	we travel with our dogs and requested a pet friendly hotel .
negative	after a 00 hour day we went to check in and there was a huge sign saying " no pets ".
negative	we could not get_ahold of anyone at their customer_service line in an effort to switch hotels using the " non_- refundable " room staying .
negative	we ended_up at a hotel that cost an_additional_$_00 which was not in our budget .
negative	the only_reason we were able to get a room was the help of the front counter woman at the no pet hotel .
negative	this reservation company is horrid on all fronts .
negative	avoid them like the plague .
negative	why is this taking so long my dog needs this food
negative	absolutely awful experience .
negative	the only_reason i bought from this website is because they had sent me an_email for 0 %_off so i figured why not .
negative	i have completed my 0nd week of my summer classes and i have yet to receive one of my books .
negative	it has_been extremely difficult to be able to complete my class without a textbook and has only been an inconvenience for me since the beginning .
negative	i will never buy from this website again .
negative	i ordered 0 cases of merrick cat_food over 0_weeks_ago .
negative	i got an_email message_saying that the cat_food was not in stock .
negative	so i wait and wait .
negative	no word from anyone about the shipment .
negative	i finally email them and there only response is they are checking but have no_idea when it will come in .
negative	they did get their money .
negative	now when will the food come in ?
negative	this company has the worst business_practice and customer_service of any company i have had the displeasure of dealing_with .
negative	danielle , a representative of optics_fast , refused to refund my money when i cancelled my order because the glasses i wanted were on back order and it was going to be weeks before they could be shipped .
negative	i was not told this up front and could not wait weeks for a pair of eyeglasses .
negative	please do not consider buying glasses from this horrible company .
negative	i would not recommend the use of this service .
negative	i was told my credit_card would not be billed , that is was just to hold and it was .
negative	i was told the hotel only had one non_smoking_room left and it had 00 .
negative	i was given a much higher_rate then i did with the hotel_directly .
negative	i would never use this service again .
negative	i am so surprised by all the good reviews as it is honestly a terrible website .
negative	my dress looked so tacky and it had ink stains all over it .
negative	i will never shop_here and i recommend others look at other forums for accurate reviews about this site .
negative	they said free_shipping then i had to pay $_00
negative	i will never use book it again , for the amount that was paid i should have never had connecting_flights , i don_'_t know who did that but it was horrible
negative	i order a queen_bed from them , huge mistake .
negative	i tried to place the order online but the promotion they had at the time ( spring sale 00_%_off ), and it wouldnt accept the code at the checkout .
negative	i called them and had to place the order over the phone ( felt very shady ).
negative	they charged my cc immediately but i did not recieve my bed till nearly 0_wks later .
negative	futonland tried to blame everyone but themselves .
negative	i would call and ask where my bed was and no one would tell me and say they would have the manager call me back that day .
negative	someone would eventually call me back several days_later .
negative	the manager made a racist comment about the shipping company and placed all the blame on them awful !!!
negative	the usps made 0 attempts to pick it up from them .
negative	dont shop_here .
negative	horrible service and not even an applogy
negative	i would not recommend this place to my worst_enemy !
negative	i got a lemon and lost everything i put down for the car !
negative	their so called warrenty is a bunch of bs nothing seems to be covered_under it .
negative	i got the car , 0 days_later it started turning off on me when i called them because they said if i have any_problems just bring it in anytime well i had to make an_appointment to bring the car in which wasn_'_t for a few_days so i was left with out a working vehicle .
negative	i took it in for a " 00 hour diagnostic test " which actually took 0 days for them to tell me they would only be fixing one of the many problem and with refurbished parts at that .
negative	the final straw was their rude customer_service and them laughing in my face saying that was just my luck , it just happens sometime !
negative	i terminated the contract and lost everything i put down , a months worth of insurance plus i had to pay for the stupid diagnostics test because drive time nor their warranty company would pay for it .
negative	the most expensive regret of my life is going to drive time !
negative	i asked about my cards that should have arrived but no one got back to me
negative	still have not received 0_weeks_later
negative	laptop arrived , webcam was not working and still is not working . emailed at_least 0 times and got no response except to say they would look into it and nothing more . i couldn_'_t try and download drives for webcam myself , as no one seemed able to tell me the exact model i had been sold .
negative	invalid phone_number and customer_service
negative	when the cartridges were installed the printer stated ink level low .
negative	i have returned
negative	we will wait and see your responce
negative	i am dissatisfied with the order because of the postage .
negative	the item arrived within 0 days of me ordering it , i paid £ 0 . 00 for delivery yet the item arrived via_royal_mail , second class at the cost of £ 0 . 00 ... this is nothing short of daylight robbery !
negative	i am happy with the item , it was as_described on the website what i '_m not happy with is the delivery service & the cost of it .
negative	based on this , i will not be using this website for future_purchases .
negative	when i first looked at ex - tech i was of the opinion that this was a product made in usa imagine my disappointment when i read made in china .
negative	i '_m not sure it is accurate .
negative	my lumber was in a heated garage all winter , yet it read 00_%
negative	i purchased a sunpak pz00x flash at b_&_h in nov 0000 .
negative	the image displayed a flash stand with it and there was no text whatsoever saying that , " accessories are optional ".
negative	i made a claim with customer_service and all they can say was , " oops , sorry about that , is there anything_else i can do for you ?"
negative	worst customer_service ever !
negative	on top of that i got different answers from phone reps , which have 0 knowledge on products ... basically , this is the last time i would purchase anything at b_&_h .
negative	imagine if they would screw something up like that on a product worth $ 0000 .
negative	i ' d_rather put my money with adorama , never had any_problems whatsover !
negative	if i could rate this a cero i would , but i only have a 0 option ...............
negative	we booked a room about ( 0 ) months in advance .
negative	my niece in arkansas was getting_married .
negative	we arrived at the rogers inn , located in rogers arkansas , immediately we realized that the pictures online didn_'_t look anything like the actual facility .
negative	we checked in and were given a room , the room looked run down , the furniture was cloth and had stains ( who_knows what ) all over them , there was no way anyone should be setting in them , the room smelt so bad that you couldn_'_t breath .
negative	i started crying , we had booked this room for a week .
negative	my husband went to the front_desk about the condition and the smell in the room , he was told we could be moved to another room .
negative	all the rooms would have been the same !
negative	my husband asked if we could get out of the weeks obligation , he was told we would still have to pay for ( 0 ) night and asked us if we would be occupying the room for that night .
negative	my husband told them that we would pay for ( 0 ) night but would not be staying .
negative	not only would the week previously booked but another night would be added to it charged to my credit_card , even_though it was credited to my credit_card it stayed on there as used for up to ( 0 ) days .
negative	we also had the charge of another hotel charged to our credit_card as well .
negative	i am not sure if i will ever be comfortable with booking something thru this website again .
negative	having placed my order , and received an_email_confirming despatch four days_later , the trouble really began .
negative	there was a link in the email to track the parcel .
negative	it said to wait 0 - 0 hours to track , so that parcelforce could enter it on the system .
negative	three_days_later , still no tracking , so i call them .
negative	no , apparently too early to do anything , and told to call back in two_days .
negative	i call back in two_days .
negative	before i even speak staff hang up , but eventually i get through and manage to speak to what i think was the world '_s rudest man .
negative	he has no_idea why i was asked to call back on monday - tracking_information can , he says .
negative	take several days to be available .
negative	he had no_explanation for why the email said the information wold be available in 0 - 0 hours , and i have been waiting over four days .
negative	he then_proceeded to insist that the 0 - 0 days it takes from despatch for delivery , should read 0 days at_least .
negative	he refused to acknowledge that the website says it takes up to 0 days for delivery ( from order ), and insisted this was from when it arrived in the uk - even_though plainly it does not say this .
negative	he repeatedly argued , shouted me down , spoke over me and told me if i could not understand the simple terms , perhaps a manager could explain it to me so perhaps i could understand .
negative	he then told me i should have paid for an expedited service for delivery !
negative	he refused to acknowledge that the six days has passed , and there is still no tracking .
negative	he cannot say when a manager will call me , he can do nothing for me if i don_'_t understand he said , and maybe a manager will call today , but maybe tomorrow , but they are very busy .
negative	aaarrrgghhhhhhhhhhhhh .
negative	and i have no parcel .......
negative	my order of dried animal food arrived slashed open inside the parcel ( no damage to mail bag ), and it was not what i needed .
negative	i contacted pet_supermarket to ask what to do and how to replace the order with what i did need .
negative	i stated it was urgent as my 00 year_old cat must eat a special_diet for kidney disease .
negative	i got a standard email that i would get a response within 00_hours .
negative	this was .
negative	followed_up 00_hours_later with a standard email_saying they were sorry for delay and would revert .
negative	after 0 days of nothing i left my complaint on the facebook_wall .
negative	this got action and i got a replacement parcel swiftly .
negative	thank_goodness because pet_supermarket then , after 0 days , responded to my complaint to tell me the date my original order was delivered ( not at all what i asked them to do and no mention of the fact i had the wrong food or a damaged parcel ).
negative	i told them this and got yet another standard email that they would respond within 00_hrs , with a follow_up email_stating sorry for the delay .
negative	a week further on and i have not heard a peep .
negative	the customer_services are an utter shambles .
negative	i cannot begin to say how angry it makes you to complain_about something , wait forever for a reply , and then get a standard response not at all appropriate to the complaint .
negative	it seems you will be ok unless things go wrong .
negative	when they go wrong , pet_supermarket clearly have not invested any decent staff or resources to deal with things .
negative	you will tear you hair out and give up .
negative	the exception is the facebook service , because of course they are less_than pleased to see a complaint so publicly and they manage to deal with that !!
negative	unfortunately for pet_supermarket they have lost my business forever as i am still so furious that they care so little for the welfare of an old cat and their customers that they take_forever to respond and then give you a standard unhelpful email , and never actually respond to the complaint .
negative	i am extremely dissatisfied with smartbuyglasses !
negative	i ordered costa del mar sunglasses .
negative	i received bifocal sunglasses .
negative	i immediately tried to call the phone_number on the invoice , only to find that it was not a working number !!
negative	so , i emailed customer_service and explained that i received bifocal sunglasses .
negative	the representative emailed the next_day .
negative	disappointment ( because the sunglasses were a christmas_present ) soon turned to frustration and finally anger after
negative	emailing back and forth for a week with representatives who insulted me by saying sbg did not make mistakes and they insisted that i take the sunglasses to an optician to prove that they weren_'_t bifocals !
negative	again , i sent more pictures ... i knew what i had received and they insisted i did not receive the wrong glasses !!
negative	when i emailed that i wanted a phone_number so i could talk to someone , i was informed that there was not a contact number !!
negative	this company claims to be an american company , but this is false !
negative	and the customer_service reps are most definitely not americans !
negative	i will never ever make this mistake again and i will inform others also .... so they don_'_t experience what i have !!
negative	!
negative	it was my first time using this website and i wasnt very happy .
negative	the flowers were for my grannys grave for christmas .
negative	she died 00 years_ago i live far away from home and every year i order flowers to be sent to my mother so she can put them on my grannys grave for me .
negative	they didnt look anythinng like the picture on the website to . me .
negative	i asked my . mother to send me a photo . of what arrived .
negative	the colours didnt look the same and . some of the flowers looked like theyd be . dead in a day or two .
negative	not happy .
negative	when i tried to book a hotel room on this site , i was sent two confirmations for two rooms on the wrong date .
negative	when i tried to call their offices - located in europe - they were closed .
negative	when i tried to leave a message , it told me the voicemail was full .
negative	i tried to email customer_service numerous_times and kept getting an_error_message .
negative	so i called back at 0 : 00 am , when their offices should have been open and i got a message that said , " due to unforeseen_circumstances , our customer_service office is closed ."
negative	i have tried every extension option and either get this message or endless ringing .
negative	almost 00_hours have gone by , and i cannot contact this company in any way .
negative	i will be disputing the charges on my credit_card as soon as they post .
negative	what a pain !
negative	stitching was poor .. the lining was not sewn evenly on gathered dress .
negative	will not purchase here again .
negative	i got a " wowcher " for a spray tan in april and made a booking for may , in neal st london .
negative	the company are not there ' apparently have moved ??'
negative	i did not get told i have sent emails to both wowcher and the company carlinii ?
negative	?
negative	yesterday the promotion is still being advertised !!!!!!!!!!!
negative	!
negative	beware i think my next step is trading_standards .
negative	i recently purchsed a great deal ... 0 nights in newcastle , a place i have always wanted to go for just £_00 . 00 !
negative	bargain !
negative	so i ring my friend all excited about our girly weekend ... and then i recieve an_email from wowcher stating that the hotel has made a mistake and there is a £_00 . 00 supplement to pay for a saturday_night_stay and there were actually exclusion dates that were not mentioned .
negative	o . k so its now £_00 . 00 for a 0 night_stay ... still a bargain !
negative	what really angered me most about this email was the fact that not just had i got an increase but i also had access to another 00 + email_addresses after we had all been copied into this email and not blind copied !
negative	my email then went mad for 00_hours as everyone was replying to all !!!!.
negative	i would have hoped that an organisation such as this would have used basic privacy settings and email ettiquette when dealing_with customers email_addresses .
negative	the glasses i ordered were the zac masons advertized as having a 00mm wide by 00mm height lens . after a excessive shipping delay 0 days after the tracking_number was posted , i received the pair of glasses the lens size is 00mm wide by 00mm height - not as_described !!
negative	!... i recommend avoiding this slipshod company and buying some place else like zenni optical as i have had positive results with them three_times in the past ..... no thank_you , global optical .. not reccommended .
negative	horror began with purchase and shipping .
negative	after purchase , company missed a friday_afternoon ups shipping deadline and equipment arrived within 00_hours of my departure .
negative	everything was working nicely on the first few connections in germany .
negative	however , when i tried to connect from my hotel in prague , i was unable to do so .
negative	i thought it was a bad connection , so i tried searching for other_providers .
negative	access was denied and i was forced to purchase internet service through the hotel .
negative	i was unable to connect for the remainder of my trip .
negative	after arriving home , i got phone and email messages telling_me i had massive usage and i needed to replenish my account to the tune of almost $_000 .
negative	i contested the amount , but was told that , after they checked with t - mobile in the czech republic , the usage had been verified .
negative	hotel and t - mobile verified my version when i made inquiries .
negative	i was lucky as i had used paypal and they couldn_'_t get to my money without authorization .
negative	so , stay away from mobility pass .
negative	if you do_business with them , use paypal so they can '_t just deduct money from an account or charge you for services they don_'_t render .
negative	while trying to book a reservation we were routed through this company , unknowingly .
negative	the correct city , state , and all other info was in , exactly as we wanted .
negative	the page flipped to the site where we were to pay .
negative	when the confirmation was printed it had the wrong state .
negative	this company ( the phone_number on the confirmation page ) was called and we were assured that we would be refunded the charged amount in approximately 0 days .
negative	the representative that assured us of this stated that this did happen at times , they were aware of this problem , and apologized .
negative	he asked if we would like to book where we initially wanted to stay .
negative	this time he booked us in the correct state just 00_minutes from where we wanted to be .
negative	this was not seen until we printed the confirmation page -- as the representative verbally confirmed the correct place , address , to include city and state while on the phone .
negative	the company was called again , this time they did cancel the charged amount to my credit_card .
negative	we ended_up calling the hotel and making_reservations directly through the hotel .
negative	to date i have called and spoken with a company representative and a company supervisor .
negative	i was told there is nothing they can do and nothing they will do .
negative	i was put in the system as a " no show ".
negative	i told them of course i did not show up , they booked me in the wrong state !
negative	i have also emailed the company to try to get this resolved - nothing .
negative	so they stole $_000 . 00 -- yes i say stole because we called and were guaranteed they would cancel this charge and they did not .
negative	and yes , we were within the cancellation time_frame .
negative	there is no excuse for this kind of poor customer_service .
negative	i would never book through this company and hope that anyone reading this will not take a chance with their hard_earned money .
negative	i had a 00x00 saved on 00 / 00 / 00 and called 0 / 00 / 00 and it was gone .... i should have gotten a phone_call ... i found a unit but along way from where i wanted a unit .... i am still shopping
negative	the flowers i ordered for my mum came on great time for mothers_day but look nothing like the picture , deluxe opinion was extra money for nothing and the card i picked was a different card .
negative	i '_m really disappointed , i could of got nicer ones from my local shop for £ 0 .. thought by spending £_00 they ' d be good but some of the flowers was dead before they even got into my mum '_s hands !!!
negative	only_thing right was the mothers_day balloon .
negative	also the customer_service by mail is rubbish as i received emails about 0 different peoples orders ...
negative	totally_unprofessional .
negative	ordered the pool in time for delivery for the long memorial_day weekend .
negative	it is going on three plus weeks and we are still_waiting .
negative	just ( while i '_m typing this ) received a phone_call from doheny '_s that the manufacturer is waiting for the walls and that they are expecting to be able to ship .
negative	i mentioned that i was expecting the pool today ( possibly ) as i was told last_week that it would be shipped on monday / tuesday of this week and to " now " receive a phone_call that it wouldn_'_t be shipped for another week .
negative	understand , my credit_card has already been charged .
negative	very , very disappointing .
negative	i order parts online all of the time with no_problems .
negative	i have been a mechanic for over 00 years ( i know my parts and cars ).
negative	i carefully placed an order online for the exact part i needed for my 0000_dodge durango with a 0 . 0l engine .
negative	there was no option other than ground shipping , so i accepted that .
negative	there was also no comment field for shipping instructions .
negative	a couple of days_later i was notified via_email by ups that my package was being shipped via_ups / usps combined shipping .
negative	that created a problem for me .
negative	i do not receive any home mail delivery from the usps .
negative	i had to make a special trip across_town to the usps carrier annex to put in another change of address form so that i could then drive across_town and pick_up my package once i got the delivery notice in my p . o .
negative	box .
negative	that was bad enough .
negative	then , when i got the package and opened it , i found out that i had received the wrong part .
negative	partsgeek has a policy that they charge a 00_% restocking_fee for returned items .
negative	you ( the customer ) have to pay the shipping_charges both_ways .
negative	this would have been almost as much as i would have gotten back on the part itself .
negative	as soon as i find out what this part fits , i plan to sell it on ebay .
negative	at_least i can get back most of my money ( minus the original shipping_charges ) even if it takes even more of my time .
negative	i am sticking with rock auto from now on .
negative	i have never had a problem getting parts from them .
negative	sometimes the lowest_price isn_'_t the best price .
negative	never again !!!
negative	buyer_beware !!
negative	!
negative	i cant even begin to figure_out how to use the product i purchased .
negative	there was no information on returns .
negative	i asked for information and have not had a response in addition it is made of plastic and i am allergic .
negative	i saw nothing indicating that before i placed my order .
negative	have been waiting for a parcel today but had to be at docs for 00 . 00 so left a card to suggest a safe place if i missed them .
negative	so i left my house at 00 . 00 to see courier sat outside the house in his van .
negative	are you delivering to me ?
negative	yes he says but i am early , i can '_t deliver until 00 . 00 .
negative	so can i have the parcel now ?
negative	no you cant not until 00 . 00 .
negative	what !
negative	excuse me are you having a laff ?
negative	i said i need to be somewhere at 00 . 00 and need to go out , but no , would not hand over parcel .
negative	in the end when i said i need to leave now he said he would leave my parcel in a secure place , ( i . e after 00 . 00 )... so he got out his van and i showed him a place he could leave it , after 00 . 00 , excuse me but surely my house is the most secure place to leave it , not outside ...
negative	he walked past my front_door to observe safe place !
negative	it was a ps0 from currys long awaited for as xmas_present or would have told him to return the parcel was so mad ... jobsworth !
negative	hi i dont_think we have received the futon_cover yet
negative	i purchased a bug shield for my husbands jeep as a gift for him .
negative	it arrived in a lovely non damaged box , but the shield was broken in several pieces .
negative	now i . am supposed to ship it back and pay for the return postage .
negative	of course there is no phone_number to call so i may speak to someone .
negative	we are very senior_citizens and are not computer_savvy , now i must take this very long box to the post_office and wait 00 days to get my credit .
negative	not happy
negative	not delivered today .
negative	first_impressions last !
negative	i purchased a pen which really wasn_'_t suitable for engraving and i should have been told this .
negative	they engraved my graphite and silver pen with gold leaf and it looked shocking .
negative	the after sales service i received was poor and the attitude of staff in customer care terrible .
negative	i wouldn_'_t use them again
negative	ordered part then got email_saying it was on back order and they would not be able to fill order .
negative	of course i was able to order the part from them for a few extra dollars ... of course i chose to order from someone_else .
negative	i have waited 0 months for a cash_back amount , and the customer_service is not worth having , also any opinion you have via the facebook_page if not favourable is just deleted
negative	how can you move forward when they don_'_t reply to your emails ?
negative	i am constantly chasing them for replies .
negative	infact i am still_waiting for a reply to my email sent to accounts @ workwearexpress . com on the 00 / 00 / 0000 , i was sent an invoice to be paid but it was already paid .
negative	they have good products at cheap prices but the staff let you down with a lack of prompt service .
negative	it said that i could pay on arrival then all of sudden i got an_email_telling_me that i had to have a credit_card , no i dont have one so to be onest you was not at all help full for me .
negative	you provide an excellent way to ship dog_food to my home .
negative	but i was horrified that the trusted website " www . dogfoodadvisor " is now listing about 00 recalls of different brands of dog and cat_food , mainly surrounding the presence of salmonella in a south_carolina diamond dog_food plant .
negative	( other brands were also manufactured in that one facility .)
negative	i understand you could say your business is to ship food , but could you somehow agree with dogfoodadvisor to at_least add a warning box at the top of your website , when the recalls total so many , that owners need to check .
negative	animals are dying !
negative	the prescription in these glasses are way off .
negative	makes me feel dizzy .
negative	not happy .
negative	they cancelled my reservation because " the price was too low ".
negative	it was a special_offer so i don_'_t understand_why they cancelled .
negative	don_'_t plan your vacation with booking . com !
negative	!
negative	i have emailed back and forth with smartbuyglasses several_times .
negative	i have asked on numerous_occasions for them to call me , and have provided both my order id and my full contact info .
negative	i even emailed the servicemanager @ smartbuyglasses . com address , and still have not received a phone_call .
negative	i have had a similar problem as the majority of the poor reviews .
negative	the glasses i ordered were out of stock in the warehouse , and they were checking with the supplier , but they suggested that i choose a different pair .
negative	i sent an_email_saying that if the original frames i wanted were not available from the supplier , then i would like to switch to a different frame .
negative	after no response for 0 days , i checked my order status .
negative	it said the stock of my original pair had been confirmed .
negative	whew .
negative	then i got an_email from them saying that the back up pair i ordered were not in stock , but are through the supplier .
negative	wait ... what ?
negative	so i immediately went back to my order status page .
negative	they have now added the second pair of glasses to my order .
negative	they have not charged me for them yet , but my total on the website has changed to show charges for both pairs .
negative	i understand the wait time , but i still have not received my glasses , nor a phone_call to straighten everything out .
negative	i cannot even get a straight answer form the famed "< private_data_removed >" who seems to be the only rep they have .
negative	all i want is to have my original order , and a phone_call .
negative	ordered tyres through black_circle , i was changing from run_flats to standard tyres on a bmw which i have done on two previous occasions .
negative	i booked in at the local_garage for fitting who refused to fit the tyres due the them not being car manufacturer recomendation .
negative	on phoning black_circle the same morning it was stated the garage had agreed to the job and it was out of their hands .
negative	the solution was ' could we go and collect the tyres and take them to a garage 00_miles_away ?'.
negative	no thankyou - we cancelled the order and went elsewhere .
negative	ordered two_pairs of curtains - identical in every way , size , colour , make , etc .
negative	well they couldn_'_t manage to get this order right .
negative	courier delivered order : one pair as ordered , the other completely wrong .
negative	when i rang customer_services they were very rude and unhelpful .
negative	escalated the problem to head_office .
negative	cannot_believe this - they will not send a courier with a replacement pair and take the wrong pair away .
negative	they want me to take the curtains back to one of their stores ( nearest shope 00_miles_away ) or post them back to them via_royal_mail ( quite a heavy parcel to carry ).
negative	this is not my error debenhams - it '_s yours .
negative	don_'_t see why i have to inconvenience myself because of your mistake .
negative	amazon can manage it !
negative	be warned .
negative	don_'_t shop online at debenhams .
negative	never again will i - never !!!!
negative	!
negative	i placed an online order on cyber_monday , received my item in a timely_manner .
negative	my son really wanted this jacket and was excited when it arrived .
negative	the jacket didn_'_t fit ( the arms were too short ) and needed to return the item .
negative	it '_s too bad because he has the windbreaker in the same size and it fits fine .
negative	the fit seemed irregular so we wanted to get it replaced as soon as possible .
negative	well , i found out it will cost me $_000 to ship a jacket i paid $_000 for !
negative	i have made several_attempts to contact someone , anyone to assist me in returning the jacket via_email .
negative	no one has responded ( not even an automatic reply ).
negative	i am now stuck with a jacket that doesn_'_t fit and out $_000 . 00 us dollars .
negative	i made my reservation about 00 months before i booked my trip to mexico .
negative	now though hotelclub offers another credit at our resort in the amount over $_000 . 00 .
negative	so my sincere advise is as follows : don_'_t book with hotelclub early or ever because hotelclub won_'_t give us the resort credits they now offer ...
negative	wait_till the last minunte to book with hotelclub or i would never use this travel site again , we got ripped - off !!!
negative	now we are bummed because we booked a three week vacation in mexico , sure could of used the resort credits ... also without telling us , hotelclub charged an extra $_000 . 00 in mx fees , that were never disclosed , and it was a separate charge to my credit_card a month later .
negative	do !
negative	not !
negative	use this travel website unless your so desparate , nver again , hotelclub has some phoney club point membership ...
negative	suddenly we don_'_t have our 000_+ points anymore , what '_s up !
negative	rip - off .
negative	this is gail regan of rhododendron , or u . s . a .
negative	blumenwaren nicht wie abgebildet und eine blume war sogar abgebrochen !
negative	i had to cancel my plans and your hotel took my money as soon as i made the reservation from my bank
negative	when i made my reservation , i specifically_asked for a room that was approved for a pet .
negative	i was told that was not a problem .
negative	however , when i arrived at the hotel , the room that was reserved for me was not pet acceptable .
negative	luckily the hotel had an extra room available for my first reservation .
negative	however , my 0nd reservation had to be canceled due to this mistake and i had to find other accomodations at the last_minute .
negative	i had a terrible experience with expedia !
negative	i '_ve worked with them before and they were good .
negative	it '_s been a while since i traveled , but based on my previous experiences , i trusted expedia .
negative	they have changed !
negative	this is what happened : i am planning a vacation in the uk and i wanted to stay in london for 0 nights .
negative	i booked 0 rooms for 0 nights at tune hotel - paddington .
negative	later that day i found out expedia over charged me by $_000 , plus , expedia charged a $_00 fee for each room each night .
negative	the tune hotel website charged less .
negative	so , i thought i would take_advantage of the " best price guarantee ".
negative	i called them up and my booking matched all the criteria accept the tune website did not covert british pounds to us dollars .
negative	they would not cancel my booking either .
negative	so , i '_m out $_000 !
negative	travelers beware !
negative	expedia wants to rip you off !
negative	never book a hotel with them without researching your choice thoroughly before hand !
negative	then , my advice is to make_sure you can cancel the booking for a full_refund just in case !
negative	..... the reason_why is because you never followed_up when i had to cancel .
negative	after three ( 0 ) phone_calls waiting for a confirmation showing the reservation was cancelled we finally went to the credit_card company .
negative	this note doesn_'_t even rate a star .
negative	when i put in the new cartridge from printerink the machine showed black_ink low and printing quality is of a very low standard cartridge it showe
negative	still_waiting for a refund , no reply to my numerous_emails
negative	i booked one of expedia ' hidden value ' rooms and selected ( 0 ) adults and ( 0 ) children .
negative	my room came back as either ( 0 ) queen or ( 0 ) twin beds .
negative	obviously not enough room for 0 people .
negative	i then was required to pay an extra $_00 to ' upgrade ' my room to what i originally requested .
negative	customer_service kept subtly blaming me for their system malfunction .
negative	" did i select right ", " sorry it '_s non_- refundable ".
negative	they did offer me a $_00 coupon - but i '_m all done with my travel booking so i '_m not sure when i can use it .
negative	plus i am forced to deal with them again .
negative	lost my documents and tried to blame me for their screw up !
negative	i will be disputing all the charges with my credit_card company .
negative	i had a problem with my flight i booked through_travelocity .
negative	after several phone_calls and several_times being frustrated i got absolutely !
negative	nowhere !
negative	very frustrating experience i will not be using travelocity in the future !
negative	very friendly management ... but very fast talking , manipulative sorta arrangement that was too good to be true .... but of corse i fell for it .
negative	i ordered a leathermen coat from them dec 0 .
negative	the first email states my order was placed and says i '_ll receive my shipment confirmation .
negative	after a day of not receiving the email i called because they had already taken the money .
negative	i sat on hold for 00_minutes and hung_up and just called the next_day .
negative	the representative said she ' d send me a new shipment confirmation .
negative	i didn_'_t get one but i was not in the mood to cuss anyone out so i waited .
negative	after 0_weeks , i received an_email_saying a portion of my order couldn_'_t be fulfilled so i would be refunded .
negative	what portion ?
negative	the sleeves ?
negative	it '_s a jacket .
negative	the item isn_'_t marked out of stock nor on backorder .
negative	also , how was she sending a new shipment confirmation_email when the item is out of stock ..
negative	i called to see when i would be receiving my refund and was told 0 - 00 days .
negative	so i ask 0 - 00 days from the day you guys took my money and pretended like you had this item in stock or 0 - 00 days from when you guys fessed up to never having it , of course the latter .
negative	it '_s been 0 days since they emailed me and on the 00th day , i '_ll be d **** d if i don_'_t see my money .
negative	quick to take money but not give it back ?
negative	i don_'_t think so .
negative	absolutely disappointed .... booked a two bed room for my family of four only for the company to book in error a king_size bed ... no one will help me and the hotel is sold out ... worst_experience ever and i will never use this site again
negative	my order was placed 0wks ago and i still_haven_'_t received what i ordered .
negative	unhappy customer
negative	on 00 october i ordered a kitchen bin (£ 00 ) from scotts of stow .
negative	it arrived 0_weeks_later with one side missing .
negative	i rang and was told that within two_weeks i would receive the missing side .
negative	two_weeks passed - i rang again several_times and kept being told it would arrive .
negative	the supervisor would not speak to me so no support for her customer_service agent who was very nice .
negative	apparently there is nothing they can do to contact their suppliers to ask them to treat a customer with an unsatisfactory order as a priority .
negative	after waiting 0_weeks for the missing side , i was told by the supervisor that i ' d been misinformed - it is not possible to send out missing bits of an order .
negative	so on 0 december they ordered me another kitchen bin .
negative	i was promised this bin between 00 and 00 december .
negative	they wanted to send me vouchers but i said i would not buy anything_else from scotts of stow .
negative	i asked for money off the bin and received a cheque for £_00 .
negative	i phoned again on 00 december because it still hadn_'_t arrived and was told by another customer_service advisor that i shouldn_'_t have been told to expect it on that day .
negative	unbelievable .
negative	it arrived on 00 december and several of the screw things broke as we were putting it together .
negative	never use this terrible company .
negative	the quality of their products is very poor .
negative	customer_service advisors give out wrong information .
negative	the supervisor was unavailable to speak to me even when she had just spoken to her advisor .
negative	when she said she ' d phone me back , she didn_'_t , i phoned and she said she was just about to phone .
negative	this lack of concern for customers is truly amazing .
negative	i would never use this company if it was the last one standing .
negative	called 0 - 000 number and no response ( the call drops ).
negative	requested refund via_email and have not heard_anything back yet .
negative	will never order from petflow again .
negative	i purchased a wine glass last_week from this shop and i wish i hadn_'_t .
negative	when it arrived it had big scratches down the side .
negative	normally , i probably_wouldn_'_t have been bothered but it '_s an xmas_present so i can '_t accept anything less_than perfect .
negative	i called customer_services to explain ( i called because they are unbelievably slow at reaponding to online requests , but more on that later ) and the lady i spoke to said that not to worry a replacement would be sent out that day on a next_day delivery .
negative	i thought this was more than acceptable and so happily thanked her and waited for my replacement to be delivered the next_day .
negative	sooooo you can probably guess that the next_day came and went and no delivery !
negative	i called customer_services again ( premium_rate phone_number ) and i was told by a vicky that she needed to speak to the warehouse and would get back to me .
negative	well , that was 0 days ago ( as of now ).
negative	i have sent another two messages online which have not been responded to .
negative	what an_absolute joke .
negative	i have never ever_experienced such terrible customer_service .
negative	this was supposed to be a secret_santa present and we are giving them on thursday and i can guarantee that this issue will not be resolved by then judging_by their previous track record .
negative	then they had the cheek to send me an e_- mail asking me to rate them and my experience .
negative	well , it was absolutely awful .
negative	they claim to be some kind of directory enquiry service but they charge you as soon as you click on a link to their site !!
negative	no authorisation process or acceptance process it appears to be immediate and is astronomical prices !!
negative	£_00 for 0 days access and immediately added to your mobile bill !!
negative	no answer at their offices either so no chance of a refund .
negative	i shall be contacting the police as i feel this may be some kind of internet / mobile scam
negative	the shower_enclosure and tray that i purchased from bath_empire resulted in me having to replace a large part of my kitchen ceiling !
negative	the waste pipe supplied was faulty and resulted in a large leak and i was unable to use the shower until it was fixed , which approx 0_weeks in total .
negative	i found this extremely difficult as i initially had the shower installed due to being heavily pregnant and with an existing disability found bathing difficult .
negative	the added stress and expense at this time was extremely upsetting .
negative	i contacted bath_empire sales_team for a response but was totally ignored !
negative	if you ' re looking for quality products and service you '_ll not find them with bath_empire , steer well clear !
negative	!
negative	talk about hard_sell .
negative	i was told by the rep checking in that i had to have their insurance .
negative	i never purchase additional insurance anywhere i travel ( even south_africa ) but was told in glasgow , that i had no other choice .
negative	the rep wouldn_'_t let_me leave without calling my insurance company to verify i would be covered ( which i declined given that it was a 0 hour time difference and the middle of the night in texas where usaa is located ).
negative	all this , because i was planning to take a car to the republic of ireland .
negative	she insisted on giving me paperwork that she said would be demanded when i took the car out of northern_ireland and on the ferry .
negative	we took ferry_crossings 0 times , and the paperwork was never requested .
negative	she may have made a sale that day , but i will never use national car_rental , or europcar ever again .
negative	i was sent a wrong item twice .
negative	i went to the trouble of explaining the error on their website but was ignored .
negative	when i eventually received a refund it was for the wrong amount .
negative	out of time , out of pocket , out of patience - never again !
negative	scam !
negative	how are they even in business ?!?!?!
negative	it seems like there are very few good reviews that are probably written by the employees / employers at the place ... not cool guys , not cool .
negative	i ordered ( 0 ) pairs of tiffany glasses , they arrived so stretched out to the point that they wouldn_'_t even fit / stay on my head !
negative	i paid for the glasses up front before they shipped , i paid to return the damaged glasses and i received ( 0 ) additional payment notices that i would have to pay more to get the replacement glasses made and shipped ...
negative	i wouldn_'_t pay more as they shouldn_'_t have sent me damaged glasses to begin with !
negative	now they won_'_t even respond to my requests for a status_update !.
negative	i finally had to put in a dispute with my credit_card company to try to get my money back .
negative	terrible experience - so not worth the $_00 i saved !
negative	!
negative	our goods where due to arrive for our company launch ; needless to say it didn_'_t arrive . when i called the where unable to find it and no apology .
negative	looking at the shipping details the delivery detail where printed at 0 . 00pm on the agreed delivery date clearly they had no_intention of meeting the agreement .
negative	blatant disregard for customer_service and rude driver .
negative	now looking at the other reviews i can see this is a company that good at failing ;
negative	i placed a telephone order for 00 boxes of tiles , the delivery was due today and a courier turned_up and has placed them in the street leaving my 00 year daughter in tears with his rudeness .
negative	speaking to orderline street delivery is part of the terms and conditions , it was not mentioned when i placed the order over the phone or when i received the confirmation_email these tiles now sitting in the street in the middle of london are according to the wickes my responsibility even_though my daughter refused the delivery and the driver left them with telling her . i will not be home to 0 . 00pm .
negative	needless to say i do not expect them to be their when i get home .
negative	i will be cancelling my kitchen order this evening with wickes because i would like a safe delivery of my goods and will be taking wickes to the small claims court for these tiles which i suspect i will never see !
negative	we had good feelings about the whole_experience , until we dropped the car back to gatwick airport .
negative	when the agent checked over the car he said we had damaged the car which we had not .
negative	so our experience changed , several points that we had issue with are as follows :-
negative	# when we arrived to collect the car we found that the hours we found on line for operating on saturday were different to the hours at kingston on thames depot ( luckily we arrived before the depot closed )
negative	# the car was still being prepared when we arrived .
negative	# the lady_who served_us was a little rushed as she had another two clients arrive just after us .
negative	i must_say she did her best and we thought she was helpful .
negative	# she showed us the previous damage that was on the panel of the car and we walked around to check for any other damaged panels .
negative	we found no more damage on panels .
negative	# no one told us to check tyres or windscreen ( which was the advice we were told we needed to look for at_gatwick .)
negative	# the agent said there was windscreen damage on the car and that we were responsible for it .. we denied any damaged caused while we had the car .
negative	he proceeded to show us the damage on the windscreen , where the patch of blackened glass , where the rear vision mirror sits , there was a small chip .
negative	we certainly had not noticed it when we checked the car but then , we hadn_'_t looked at the windscreen and you could not see the damage from the inside of the car at all .
negative	we barely saw it when he showed us , as it was on this blackened part of the windscreen .
negative	# we still maintain that we did not do the damage .
negative	we asked the agents to please forward our complaint to the next level and asked for them to contact us through our email address before applying any charges .
negative	this was not done .. we were subsequently charged the very next_day aud 000 . 00 .
negative	we have to date not received any explanation as to what the charges were for fuel , repairs etc .
negative	# we will in future be more careful checking our hire cars as this is the first time we have had this problem .
negative	it was too bad that the people at kingston were not as " picky " as the people at_gatwick .
negative	# we will never use europecar again in australia or uk as we have in the past .
negative	we take exception that they did not contact us at all .
negative	hi
negative	i live in portugal and we have great difficulty getting good tennis skirts so we choose to shop online .
negative	we all buy nike_tennis skirts - i recently put in an order for 0 club nike_tennis skirts - what arrived got immediately sent back .
negative	we did a full comparision from last years skirts to this years skirts .
negative	the quality is gone .
negative	when i returned the skirts i did explain that the waist band is narrower - definitely the quality of the fabric used is not as good - i can appreciate lenght is shorter maybe thats fashion but at club level they are too short .
negative	it has made us all in vale do lobo to rethink how we purchase our tennis outfits .
negative	i look_forward to your response .

negative	i have been ordering from 0 sites for renting_textbooks , the only one i have issues with is bookbyte .
negative	their shipping time is way too long .
negative	i '_m still_waiting for a book that i ordered at the end of 0000 .
negative	they aren_'_t very customer_service oriented , i asked for compensation from my last order and they said no .
negative	i don_'_t think they realize how important good customer_service is .
negative	i won_'_t be using them ever again .
negative	the parts i ordered were not packed correctly and arrived in multiple pieces .
negative	according to partsgeek they are not responsible for items that are broken in shipment even if their employees incorrectly packed the items .
negative	this will be my last time purchasing from partsbreak ...
negative	it hasnt arrived yet !!
negative	!
negative	never going to order from this site again because their return_policy on bathing_suits is a rip_off .
negative	i ordered two bathing_suits and wanted to exchange one and they would not do it even_though it was brand_new and still had all the tags and everything on it .
negative	hate this site .
negative	waste of money .
negative	having never flown spirit_airlines before , i had no_idea the ridiculous fees they charge to make up for their low fares .
negative	travelocity needs to do a better job disclosing that info or stop selling spirit_airlines tickets all together .
negative	personally i would choose the latter .
negative	if i had known that you would be charging my card * at the time of booking * and i could not cancel for free -- i would not have booked this room !
negative	that information needs to made available to customers before they book the room !!!!!!!
negative	!
negative	i will never use this website again !
negative	had not realized i had been transferred to their site from the marriott site ... saw that they charged more per_night to stay three versus two .
negative	when confronted they said tough luck it is what it is .
negative	i immediately cancelled the reservation called the hotel direct and got the same room and dates for almost $_000 less_than reservation_counter was gouging me for .
negative	i can '_t wait to see that credited to my american_express .
negative	ae will not cover the charge !
negative	bought a camera , sandisk 00gb and a camera case ( x ' mas promotion one package ) price £_000 . 00 - brilliant !
negative	!
negative	wrapped the present for hubby , he_loves it .
negative	then we found out the case doesn_'_t fit the camera .
negative	went back the next_day ( boxing_day ) to complaint and hoping to get a case that ftt - but no currys customer_service on that day ( fair enought ).
negative	went back after our holiday to ireland and guest what !
negative	!
negative	they charged me an extra £ 0 . 00_pounds to have the right case when it was suppose to be a package !
negative	what a fraud !!
negative	no more of this crap !!
negative	will buy from somewhere_else .
negative	btw : currys customer_service - not much of a service , some doesn_'_t have a clue what they are doing .
negative	no proper training given .
negative	failed big time !
negative	!
negative	i ordered a ps0 controller for my grandson for christmas .
negative	it was ordered on dec_00th .
negative	my credit_card was charged on dec_00th and i still have not received the order .
negative	my daugher and i have called several_times and have not been able to talk to anyone .
negative	they tell us all reps are busy and to leave a number and they will call back and they never due .
negative	i am ready to cancel this order and never do_business with this co . again .
negative	i thought i was getting a great deal for my husband only to find out from my bank_statement i was charged $_00 .
negative	for something that i thought i was getting for $_00 . 00 .
negative	i made a few inquires and was told that i was charged for turning my american $ into british pounds even thou i clicked on the american flag in the top right corner .
negative	so i have asked for a refund and i will get what i need from someone_else .
negative	nearly every time i use wowcher i have problems ordering the items .
negative	am going to cancel my account with them and stop making any further_purchases .
negative	i am sick of the hassle i always encounter .
negative	i ordered products .
negative	i only got a partial shipment without an explanation .
negative	when i inquired_about the remainder of the order , i was told the product was out of stock .
negative	i would have preferred to know when ordering , or at_least be informed as soon as the incomplete shipment went out .
negative	the lack of info is not ok
negative	the part in the picture is not the part i received a complete rip_off ...
negative	i had i go re find the part ...
negative	thanks for wasting my time and money !!!!!!
negative	i will never shop_here again and i will warn all of my friends !!!

negative	aldrig før har_jeg oplevet så utroværdigt et forløb .
negative	mine møder med sf syddanmark bærer kun præg af_en inkompetent sagsbehandling , en såkaldt mægler med høreapparat som slet_ikke hørte halvdelen af mødet , gik midt i det_hele for at skifte batteri , - en inkompetent jurist som konstant var konflikt optrappende på alle områder .
negative	barnet bliver ikke hørt , og først efter klage til familiestyrelsen blev det hørt , der lyves , bøjes regler og undgås at træffe afgørelser som følger lovgivningen , skilsmissebørn er retsløse med de statsforvaltninger der_er i dag .
negative	i order 000 bussiness cards and i paid online with my debit_card in that moment its been a week already and i still no have the cards or the confirmation order , its a plus to say that they took de . money out of my account
negative	have returned damaged part .
negative	no one has contacted me yet !
negative	i ordered roses to be delivered today .
negative	it is now 0 pm and i have not received them .
negative	i have called the call_center 00 times ( no exaggeration ) and cannot get a human_being on the line .
negative	after a couple of minutes the line says the wait time is longer_than usual and hangs_up on me !
negative	i have emailed them twice and have not received a reply to those either .
negative	i have no_idea where my flowers are or if i am even recieving them anymore !!
negative	this is not okay for the amount of money i spent on them !!
negative	still_waiting !!!
negative	beyond upset !
negative	i will never order from avas again !
negative	i really enjoy how low their prices are , however their policies are out of this world .
negative	first , they never have anything in stock and you don_'_t find out about it until a few_weeks_later when you get your refund .
negative	second , i ordered a small in a dress and they shipped me a medium .
negative	i had originally used a free_shipping promotion_code and they refused to go_ahead and send me the correct size with a prepaid return_slip to send the medium back .
negative	they said their policy is for me to pay to send it back and then they would ship me the correct size ... all charges on me .
negative	this is ridiculous and i '_m reporting them to the bbb .‎
negative	we ordered parts and received wrong parts that are damaged .
negative	we can not get_ahold of anyone on the 0 - 000 number .
negative	the only way to communicate is through e_- mails that do not get answered for 0 days .
negative	then they want us to pay for shipping the damaged wrong part back in the same box that all the parts came in , that is very damaged too .
negative	the box is over sized and that is probably why the part was damaged .
negative	we still need the right part , so we can finish the customers truck and return it to them .
negative	i placed an order for 0 nucs to be shipped the 0nd week of april .
negative	it is may_0th and i have yet to receive them .
negative	when i called to cancel the order i was told i could not without losing half of my payment even_tho they had failed to deliver .
negative	then they told me i hadn_'_t actually paid for them .
negative	i spent a day trying to prove that i had indeed paid for them by debit_card over the phone . after leaving several messages and not getting a call back , my call was finally answered on the second day of calling .
negative	at this time lori said that they had the record of my full payment and told me my bees would be shipped that week .
negative	it is now a week_later and i still have not seen the bees or heard_anything from pmtc .
negative	i am very disappointed in the whole deal .
negative	update the bees arrived today may_0th .
negative	i am satisfied with the bees .
negative	i just wish someone had told me they had been shipped .
negative	if i had not been home this morning they would have stayed in the post_office til monday .
negative	they are light compared to the package bees i buy from simpson '_s but they had a low mortality count .
negative	that is always a good thing .
negative	do not recommend to use this for reservations of any sort !
negative	a family emergency came and they would not change the date to accommodate for this reservation and family emergency .
negative	i was so disappointed that they coldly told me that it '_s a policy .
negative	use another travel site for reservations .
negative	website stated would not be sent to the warehouse for shipment readiness until the date i told on my order and they actually sent it the day before so it cost me 00 . 00 in overdraft fees .
negative	will not be ordering any time soon .
negative	they have fake reviews ....
negative	must read ... they will scam you !
negative	cheap fabric !
negative	no returns !
negative	beyond disappointed with overall purchase !
negative	they will take your money
negative	will not buy again !!!
negative	!
negative	i bought the oratene antiseptic gel & maintenance gel - there are no cautions for diabetic animals !!!
negative	!
negative	this contains dectrose and cellulose basically straight sugar !!!
negative	i want a refund due to no cautions for diabetics on the product information .
negative	thanks you could have killed my dog
negative	i was in a hurry for a teacher gift .
negative	book plates sounded_like a good idea .
negative	should have looked a bit more closely , as i received what i could have done myself .. a few sheets of a template ( think avery sticker sheets ) for a personalized book plate .
negative	i could have printed these out on a color printer myself .
negative	presentation is awful .
negative	i was expecting a booklet ... or something like that .
negative	i was embarrassed to give the gift .
negative	i was more embarrassed by the cost .
negative	print quality was good .
negative	they arrived on time .
negative	i was very happy to quickly make a reservation , but then made the mistake of purchasing the additional insurance .
negative	the website claimed i could get 000_% refunded for it if i chose to cancel the insurance .
negative	this is not true .
negative	i sent an_email to the person responsible for insurance and they responded with a 0 - 000 number that informed me they couldn_'_t help me since my confirmation number didn_'_t work for their system .
negative	i then called the rentalcars . com website 0 - 000 number only to be transferred to 0 different people .
negative	the last person was located in the uk and had no_idea how to help me since all the people of in the us have had the same problem .
negative	their answer was to cancel the whole reservation and re book .
negative	the problem with this is that the price has increased from when i first made the reservation .
negative	not that i really think anyone there will actually read this , but i would just like to say i hate your service .
negative	i could have given it five_stars .
negative	you have a really nice site .
negative	the cost of acceptable .
negative	your customer_service reps are nice .
negative	which is where the problem comes in .
negative	i have to call in to confirm myself every freaking month .
negative	every time i want to see my credit_score i have to call in .
negative	why ?
negative	i still have no clear answer .
negative	last time i asked i was told it was because of all the times other people have screwed_up my last name , making the public record which has nothing on it fail to match up in your system .
negative	other people screw up and i '_m the one that has to pay for it .
negative	it ticks me off more every_single time i have to go through it .
negative	the moment i find a competing site that offers their service for the same or lower price , i '_m canceling this account .
negative	and fyi , your hold music sucks too .
negative	it wouldn_'_t kill you people to update it once in a while .
negative	they are the worst ... i order a product on jan_0th it is now jan_00th i still have not received it a guy name michael x . contacted me to make me feel better stating the usps dont_know the actual date and to following the tracking website he attached .... this is bs ..... i will never , ever in my life order nothg frm these ppl nomore .... i tell they are the worst .... if somebody on this website is giving them a 0star trust me they work for the company ...... if it was a rating for no rate i would have clicked that one ......
negative	i ordered 0 shirts from this company and paid $_000 .
negative	i placed my order on 00 / 00 and was promised to receive the order between 00 / 00 - 00 / 00 plenty of time for christmas .
negative	when my order came i was so disappointed .
negative	i only received 0 shirts correctly .
negative	0 came blank and 0 did not come at all .
negative	i used this company in the past and was happy .
negative	not this time !
negative	the only_thing worse than my incomplete order was the customer_service i received after .
negative	i called and used their automated_response to request a call back 0 times and only received a call back once .
negative	i sent multiple_emails and they would respond by telling_me my order was delivered .
negative	when i finally did speak with someone they told me they could refund me for the order i didn_'_t receive or reprocess my order free of charge .
negative	free of charge ???
negative	i already paid he acted_like he was doing me this big favor by resending the order i never received !
negative	when i said i wanted a full_refund and i would return the shirts he said i would have to pay for shipping and handling .
negative	and then the phone disconnected .
negative	so i know have to waste more of my time calling back to get a refund !
negative	ridiculous !!
negative	!
negative	i had to make a change more then a month in advance it cost me $_00 + what a rip_off , i will not be using your service again .
negative	thanks for nothing !
negative	i booked for 0 days on big_bus_tour for me and my family of 0 .
negative	we only spent 0 whole days in london and because of big_bus_tour , our limited time was wasted waiting for the big_bus that took more than 00_minutes to arrive .
negative	hence we ended_up taking the tube instead .
negative	this site totally deceived us .
negative	said they had a part in stock and charged our credit_card .
negative	then , without so much as an explanation email or phone_call , refunded our credit_card .
negative	we wouldn_'_t have bothered to place an order if we didn_'_t know the part was available .
negative	shameful .
negative	i would not purchase anything_else from this company .
negative	i purchased a spa package and when purchased i was informed that the carrier would call to set_up a time and day for drop_off and set_up .
negative	not only did the carrier not call me and left a huge palet of boxes at the front of the office , but absolutely no help with carrying anthing in or setting_up .
negative	when i spoke with customer_service about this , i was informed that this " cost extra " which i wouldve been more than happy to pay , but didn_'_t because i was told it was already included .
negative	the facial / massage_bed that was purchased pretty_much came put_together other than the legs needing to be attached .
negative	once the bed was set_up ... it was horrible !!!
negative	the bed was leaned to one side more than the other and only got worse if you tried to adjust the position of the bed , which the latches to the bed did not work as well so we had to use a tool to even move the bed up and down .
negative	to make_matters worse as soon as a person weighing 000_+_lbs sits on the bed , the foot of the bed pops_up and it sounds as if its going to break with even that amount of weight on it .
negative	i would never put a client on this bed for many reasons but also for the simple fact that someone could easily fall off this bed and sue the company .
negative	the pkg also came with a trolley .
negative	the company sent me two of the same legs so it was not able to be put_together .
negative	upon having issues with both items opened from this pkg i decided to not attempt anything_else with the equipment sent until the company fixed everything .
negative	frankly i just wanted to return it , but when i spoke with customer_service regarding the equipment issues i was told to take a video and pictures of the issues and email it to them which at that time they would send it to another dept to have it evaluated .
negative	horrible customer_service for those who rely_on their equipment to make a living .
negative	i am in the process of hopefully getting everything resolved , but i do not recommend this company and do not see myself ever purchasing from them again .
negative	i ordered four different items from this web_site .
negative	they told me orginally they would ship out right_away but then changed their story when one of the items was on back order .
negative	i don_'_t understand_why they wouldn_'_t ship out the three other items and i didn_'_t feel_like waiting another two_weeks for my products so i canceled my order .
negative	i was told my account would be credited 0 - 0 business days .
negative	it has now been two_weeks and they have still not returned my money .
negative	when i called today i was told that they " forgot " process the return .
negative	hmmm ... great way of doing_business .
negative	i wonder_how many other people they have done this to .
negative	if i do not receive my money back in 0 - 0 business days i am going to call the bbb on them .
negative	they should not be in business .
negative	their customer_service reps are un - caring , insensitve , and rude .
negative	they also have a heavy accents so i can barely understand what their saying .
negative	i will never use priceline again .
negative	i booked a room with their " lowest_price guarantee ".
negative	i paid almost $_00 more than the hotel would have charged me if i had just walked in off the street .
negative	priceline is a joke !
negative	!
negative	ordered some auto_parts through amazon , after a month i get nothing .
negative	0 request '_s later they issue me a refund , only to get the refund wrong .
negative	they finally get the refund right , only now , they send totally different parts that i never ordered , in place of the parts that they never delivered in the first order .
negative	at_least they did not ship me an assault rifle like they did to someone in dc .
negative	i went into the hotel website to make a reservation , and , unknown to me , my call flipped over to a reservation center .
negative	when in the world did this become the way reservations are made without the knowledge of the person making the reservation .
negative	we have made reservations for years direct with the hotel and it is appalling to learn that this type of call immediately goes to someone_who doesn_'_t identify themselves as someone other than the hotel and they charge your card immediately ... hotels charge the card when you check in which is what my expectation was .
negative	now i have to go through a horrendous process while they credit my card .
negative	i will_definitely never use expedia for anything and will inform everyone i know in hopes they don_'_t either .
negative	in the future , if i cannot make a reservation direct with the hotel by phone through their reservations department , i won_'_t book with them either .
negative	i was in hotels for 00 years to include being a general_manager so i am aware of how a reservation should work .
negative	i asked that this be mailed to a different address than mine .
negative	you sent it to me instead
negative	terrible , so_far .
negative	i have yet to see my order - 00 - 00000000 - i still have not received it yet !
negative	i have a volkswagen jetta and my parts are hard to find .
negative	so i decided to google my part numbers .
negative	i was in a hurry to get the parts so i paid an extra few_dollars to have it in one to two_days .
negative	i choose stock wise , paid $_00 . 00 on a sunday and didnt get the part until friday the expected delivery day was tuesday .
negative	tried to call them and got no one but an automatic service about my email not someone personally calling to explain the situation if there was one at all .
negative	have not received product
negative	i have ordered 0 times from this site but will never do it again !
negative	they do not deliver in the time they promise !
negative	i have always had a po_box but i got a call today that said fedx had my order but did not deliver to po boxes !
negative	would have been nice if they had told me that they could not deliver my order to my po_box when i ordered .
negative	i had always had my orders sent to a p o box !
negative	i had to go to extra trouble to pick_up my order instead of it being delivered to me !
negative	there are many sites that have the same products and they are much more reliable and honest !
negative	first of all , i left my car unlocked for convenience for the employee , and after over an_hour wait ( past the appt time ), we went back to the car to get the receipt .
negative	as we were standing there , the horn started going off spastically !
negative	sure enough , i stepped back and the employee came around the corner still pushing the alarm button .
negative	i mean maybe one or two honks if u need to find the car , but he gave having an alarm a whole new meaning !
negative	!
negative	after he drove the car into the bay , we witnessed him fully rifling thru the glove box and center console for close to about a minute .
negative	when he finally noticed us standing there , he looked like a deer in headlights , called over another employee and asked him a question about brakes .
negative	after comparing to management , we were told he was looking for air ride ( in the console )!!!
negative	immediately canceled appt for front tires for next week , we will_definately be going elsewhere .
negative	i was not contacted for over 0_weeks about a question on my order and then when i called and had to leave a message to have someone call me back ( which is ridiculous that no one answered the phone ) the person_who called me back insisted i didn_'_t get the info i put on my order about a font change from their website / order system and kept basically calling me a liar .
negative	after about 0 minutes of going back and forth on the issue , i finally just asked to credit my account and cancel my order because i was not feeling good about ordering from them at this point .
negative	it is ashame because i really liked the custom tags i wanted to order .
negative	i would be very careful when ordering from this on - line company !
negative	i went on the website , they had my product there , i ordered it , then my order was cancelled .... no call just an_email .
negative	so i ordered it again ... cancelled it again .
negative	i finally called the customer_service phone_number and got a not so polite woman on the phone that rudely told me that my phone is old and that the battery i want to buy is not in stock .
negative	so why is it on the website as if it is ???
negative	hello ?
negative	i was very disappointed in the product i received .
negative	it was not what i had ordered .
negative	i had ordered a " decorative line border " locket with text block engraving on the back .
negative	what was sent to me was the " greek key " design with text script engraving .
negative	also , it stated that the locket was 0in by 0 . 00in but the width alone was barely . 00in !
negative	it is very disappointing that i spent $_00 to receive the wrong product .
negative	there is no excuse for this , as the site clearly_states which locket is which and the catalogid on my order detail matches the one on the site for the " decorative line border ."
negative	i suppose it was foolish of me to even give this company my business after i read the reviews online , but i figured i would give them a chance .
negative	and when i emailed them about all of this , i didn_'_t even get a response with an_apology , let_alone one that tried to make amends .
negative	honestly , how hard is it to pay_attention to detail ?
negative	i '_m thoroughly frustrated and disappointed in this company .
negative	the product is still acceptable enough to give as a gift - but to pay close to $_000 and have almost every_detail neglected , and for it to be on the wrong item entirely , and to not even get an_apology ?
negative	i have lost all faith in this company .
negative	i gave them a shot in spite of what i read online , but they only proved those critics correct .
negative	now i am unfortunately just another critic .
negative	but what do they care , they got their money ...
negative	pathetic
negative	im very disappointed in your service .
negative	you accepted my shipping addresses i gave and then went_ahead and sent my package all the way to buffalo ny to fed_x i never use fed_x as its too far away from my home to go .
negative	i tried to talk to someone on the phone about my plight and he was a snotty uncaring man that did nothing to help me except tell me to phone fedx and clear it up myself !
negative	i replied , " you could at_least phone them and correct the problem seeing as your company was the one who caused it " well he told me that fedx had all_sorts of drop_off spots in niagara falls ny .
negative	when i talked to fedx the girl said that they didnt and i had to use a physical_address instead of my pobox address .. my sick hubby had to drive all the way to buffalo to pick_up a lousy bag of cat_food !!
negative	i will never use your lying web - site with its nasty phone servers again .
negative	what kind of a company only uses one shipping provider anyway ?
negative	most reputable web sites give you a choice of postal shippers ---- not just one !
negative	how about usps or ups ???
negative	just as we should have more than one choice for paying we should also have a choice of how we want to ship !!!
negative	get with the programme or you will loose a lot more customers than just me !!
negative	!
negative	due to the weather , i had to cancel my business trip to d . c .
negative	however , i had purchased insurance for my flight , so i was happy that i would be able to be reimbursed , or be able to use the flight at a later time .
negative	however , when i tried to make flight arrangements two_weeks_later , i was put on hold for over 00_minutes , and then , once i was finally put on the line with an agent , he said he couldn_'_t hear me and he hung_up on me .
negative	during that time period , the flight and hotel that i was trying to book went up over $_000_dollars .
negative	i booked it , and i still am out $_000 for the flight that i bought insurance for .
negative	to put it mildly , i am not pleased .
negative	i recently made reservations and needed to change them within 00_hours .
negative	i was on hold for over an_hour when an agent finally answered .
negative	during the few_minutes we spoke , she had to place me on hold several_times .
negative	the last time she put me on hold , i waited another 00_minutes and then the line was disconnected .
negative	i called the next_morning and , after being on hold for 00_minutes , did speak with an agent who was helpful .
negative	i understand there was travel issues in the east ; however , 0 hours is too long to wait to speak with someone .
negative	i will never use travelocity again .
negative	i have made an order with this company and they have taken the payment but will not send my order !!
negative	after 0_weeks the order status remains on ' pending ' without_any explanation .
negative	have written a bunch of e_- mails to this company without reply !
negative	!
negative	company sucks .
negative	the wrong room was booked and then the only way to fix it was to cancel , then it takes up to 00 days to get a refund ?
negative	i ended_up calling the hotel_directly and got the right room , at the same rate !
negative	i would give you a lower number if possible !
negative	i place an order 000000000 . was told items were in stock and available .
negative	kept checking back - to find out today ( the day i should be getting it ) it is back ordered .
negative	it stills says processing never has said back ordered !
negative	i would have cancelled my order and ordered someone_else .
negative	which is probably why it doesnt say that it is not available !!!
negative	terrible and deceitful service
negative	everything about this trip was a disaster .
negative	we were sent in the wrong direction on the green line .
negative	so we wasted more than 0 / 0 hour before we could even get onto the blue line .
negative	when we got off at a stop ( it is , after all , hop - on , hop - off ), we couldn_'_t find space on another bus for quite a while .
negative	so when we did , we decided we ' d better not get off again .
negative	however , big_bus foiled us again , by suddenly announcing that the driver had completed his hours and evreybody had to get off -- when we then waited another 0 / 0 hour for a replacement bus .
negative	when we wanted to get off again , we took a taxi back to our hotel .
negative	waste of money and very annoying .
negative	great products , socially inept staff .
negative	didn_'_t appreciate the comments about wives and women while i stood next to my husband .
negative	it was offensive ...
negative	especially as we were spending our money at your store .
negative	had we not been in severe need of a the lap_top , we would have immediately left your store .
negative	will we recommend the store , depends on an_apology and if there will be change .
negative	i have ordered some wooden_blinds and i was first told i would get them 0 days after i ordered them , so i booked the day off , i then was told on the working day before that they wasnt go to be me until the tuesday , so i booked the tuesday off of work , and i have sat in all day waiting for them and i thought something was right , so i phoned up and i have found out that they gave_me the wrong day and that i will get them tomorrow , but this isnt for sure as it is an ' eta '.
negative	i have now used up 0 days holiday waiting in for my blinds .
negative	i am really not happy about this .
negative	i am rather upset about this as i was planning to buy a lot of blinds from this company , but i cant take 0 days holiday everytime i decorate a room .
negative	ordered an outdoor waterproof jacket .
negative	on receipt the large jacket had been screwed_up into a ball and stuffed into a bag which was far too small for it .
negative	it was really really creased .
negative	it was made of a fabric which can '_t be ironed .
negative	the creases still_haven_'_t dropped out .
negative	i kept it because my daughter really wanted it for school but i think it was extremely poor service .
negative	contacted superdry customer_services and got the usual fatuous not really bothered reply .
negative	the wallpaper is charged at full price .
negative	but is reject .
negative	white marks are random all over the paper .
negative	it does not state reject or faulty but is sold at full price .
negative	disappointed .
negative	it was for my daughters 00th_birthday to decorate her bedroom .
negative	beware , beware beware .
negative	poor service sent the wrong part and can not reach anyone .
negative	tried several emails and everything and still_haven_'_t heard_anything .
negative	i paid for a part and they shipped me a completely different part .
negative	i booked 0 return luggage included flights to coolangatta from act .
negative	to be first quoted 000 . aud then it jumped to 000 . aud then when i checked my account to discover they had taken 000 . aud .
negative	it wasn_'_t an easy process to purchase online .
negative	then when we got to the airport i was told i would be charged 00 . aud per bag each plane change . which made the flight cost a further 000 . aud .
negative	totally unreal price .
negative	i willnot be recommending bravo_fly ever .
negative	several days ahead , i made a motel reservation for myself , my husband , and our daughter .
negative	i specified ground_floor , since my husband ( 00 years old ) does not balance as well as he used to , and i ( 00 ) have much difficulty on stairs .
negative	we arrived at the motel to find that they had no record of our reservation , for which i had printed out the specifications and the reservation number .
negative	the front_desk_clerk told me this was the third such incident this evening .
negative	being too tired to look for another motel , we accepted the only room left , on the second floor , with one bed ; the motel personnel brought in a roll - a - way bed and discounted our rate .
negative	our daughter was able to assist us up the stairs and carry our_luggage .
negative	we certainly won_'_t ever use expedia again !
negative	love the item that i purschase !
negative	shipping took_forever though .
negative	and cusomer service rep doesn_'_t have the idea how long my item will arrive .
negative	christmas_present that became a new year ' present .
negative	very dissapointed !
negative	if no one contacts me soon i will contact my bank and try to get my money back and never , never shop with pure_health again
negative	hi , disappointed that the cancellation and sms charges were not obvious .
negative	they should be selected rather_than added .
negative	your company lie to people to get their business .
negative	i ask someone 0 times
negative	if i could cancel without fees was told yes .
negative	less then 00hrs later i cancelled was told there was a 000 . 00 cancelation_fee .
negative	after fighting with the people on the phone was told it was waived no fee .
negative	that was 0_weeks_ago .
negative	i checked my credit_card today and the entire 000 . 00 was charged to my card .
negative	i have called my credit_card to stop payment .
negative	i will never use your company again .
negative	you just lie and take_advantage of people .
negative	and it would be nice if you could hire people you can at_least understand on the phone .
negative	i '_m sure it is just part of taking_advantage of people .
negative	i ordered the tick collar for my 00_lb dog and within hours of wearing it , she began to become very lethargic and spacy .
negative	for some_reason , i didn_'_t immediately make a connection with having put on the tick collar .
negative	her condition lasted about 00_hours , and then she became better .
negative	i discussed what happened to her with our vet when i took one of our cats in for a dental , soon after this .
negative	my vet asked if it had a particular chemical called amitraz in it .
negative	she said that some dogs have bad reactions to it .
negative	she said it was sometimes used in mange treatments , and that was her experience with it .
negative	i checked , and indeed , the drug amitraze is in this collar .
negative	maybe a bigger dog would not be affected , but it truly made made charlie anne very sick .
negative	one of the products i received didn_'_t work and the other i got the wrong quality .
negative	to anybody thinking of using the services of this company ....
negative	please don_'_t !
negative	i placed an order online on 00 july , paying in advance via sagepay .
negative	an_email_confirmation was received immediately and that was the first and only contact i have managed to achieve with this company .
negative	the telephone_number supplied in the confirmation rings incessantly , with no scope for leaving a message .
negative	emails receive no response and although sagepay inform me that they contacted the company , i am not aware that they received any answer , either .
negative	the address supplied in herne bay , kent is a private house , which i have seen for myself as i live not far away .
negative	i did not call in at the address as i was waiting for the " reasonable time " ( 00 days ) to elapse before cancelling the order .
negative	a recorded delivery letter to the address , informing the company of my intention to cancel the order under the sale of goods act and the distance_selling regulations , has received no response , but has not been returned by the post_office , so was presumably signed for .
negative	to add to the mystery , the company has not actually taken the payment via sagepay and will not now be able to do so .
negative	i have now cancelled the order , am obviously without the goods ordered and have paid for a recorded delivery letter with no means of recouping the cost .
negative	i shall now try to persuade sagepay to kick this company into touch as one of their merchants and am enlisting my local citizens ' advice bureau '_s help .
negative	they intend to ask kent county council '_s trading_standards department to investigate britishsupermarketworldwide . com to ascertain whether the company is trading according to the relevant regulations .
negative	in the meantime , please avoid this company like the plague !
negative	ps to trustpilot : what is the point of insisting on a minimum number of stars in a case like this ?
negative	one star out of five is a score of 00 %: quite ludicrous !
negative	my fiancé purchased me valentines_day flowers .
negative	he purchased them on february_00th for valentines_day .
negative	not only were they not delivered on valentines_day , but every time we attempt to get_ahold of the company we are hung_up on by both the automated_system and the people that work there .
negative	my flowers were finally delivered today ( 0 / 00 ) and not only were they dead , broken and frozen ... but the balloon didn_'_t even come with a stick .
negative	i am truly horrified by this company .
negative	i took multiple photos .
negative	i suggest no one ever use this company .
negative	my order number 000000 .
negative	my order was shipped out 0 days_later after i called for the id number was then sent to my email , the representative told me i should receive my shoes at the end of next week so i waited by the end of the week there was no shoes so my husband called and was told the order never shipped out because that shoe was not in stock .
negative	so was we going to get our money back ?
negative	no .
negative	until we called .
negative	never again will i buy from amiclubwear .
negative	the parcel was not delivered and after a week i had to make a number of calls just to find out that it is waiting for me in the local post_office .
negative	no one left me a delivery attempt note , nor gave_me a call nor live me a note that i need to pick_up the parcel from the post_office .
negative	i could not pick_up the parcel before i go away
negative	paypal got too big for their britches .
negative	due to a comment a purchaser put in a payment to me , they closed my account and held my money for 0 months .
negative	this after my perfect account for many years .
negative	i would not recommend them to anyone .
negative	i had a full trip booked with travelocity leaving 0 / 00 at 00 : 00_pm to san_juan puerto_rico .
negative	our check - in date at hotel was 0 / 00 , in the morning at gran melia resort .
negative	we also booked ground_transportation to and from the hotel / airport .
negative	this transportation was cancelled , notice i received via_email , no phone_call .
negative	i then had to book a rental_car , there was no other shuttle transportation available .
negative	for reasons , i was not given .
negative	on 0 / 00 our flight with jetblue was cancelled .
negative	we were pulling up in the airport at approximately 0 : 00_pm .
negative	getting dropped_off and our transportation departed .
negative	we received the call as we were walking in to the airport .
negative	i did not recognize the number , therefore i did not answer .... no message was left for me on my voicemail .
negative	i then realized after checking the flight monitor that our flight was cancelled .
negative	we spent several hours approximately 0 on the phone with travelocity while in the airport .
negative	the first representative put me on hold for 00_minutes while checking with jetblue representatives on available flights .
negative	i was standing at the jetblue counter and told the travelocity representative this however she refused to believe me and refused to speak directly to the jetblue representative directly in front of me .
negative	therefore , i was on hold for 00_minutes .
negative	i was then told that there were no flight availability on jetblue sooner_than tuesday 0 / 00 arriving in san_juan @ 0 : 00_pm .
negative	our flight departing san_juan was on 0 / 00 at approximately 0 : 00 a . m . for the amount of money we spent on this trip i did not find this comparable to spend 0 days plus a run_around on transportation / flights .
negative	i asked the travelocity representative for assistance with finding a more feasible flight .... she told me that i could cancel my 0 / 00 flight and check - in with representatives at different airlines within the airport to find a flight - which i would have to pay for and wait for a reimbursement on the cancelled 0 / 00 flight .
negative	now this is at approximately 00 - 00 : 00 at night , the airport was pretty_much shut_down except for the jetblue counter .
negative	i asked the travelocity representative to please help me find a flight , also asking how much the reimbursement would be from jetblue on the cancelled 0 / 00 flight .
negative	she said she didn_'_t know " if " jetblue would reimburse and as she was about to once again make a call to check with jetblue , we were cut_off or she hung_up on me - after over an_hour !!
negative	!
negative	i then called travelocity representative back , going through the same procedure and willing her to help me .
negative	she was very rude as i admit my frustration tolerance was not up to par .
negative	i told her to please check records on the previous call .
negative	i asked for reimbursement on the days missed at the hotel if we were to take the flight on 0 / 00 she could not give me an answer after put on hold once again for her to check with the hotel .
negative	she put me on hold for quite_sometime , i then asked her to speak to a superior representative and was put on hold once again for approximately 00_minutes .
negative	after a long deliberation with the superior representative and several hours of hold time over several minutes of talk time with a representative , we cancelled our entire trip .
negative	devastated and told we would have to wait 0_weeks for a reimbursement .
negative	this is in my mind unacceptable service .
negative	i am a massachusetts educator on vacation for school break .
negative	i work hard to give to others .
negative	i am a counselor and coach , teacher and friend to a school of over 0000 students .
negative	i look_forward to my time off to regroup , release and relax .
negative	coming from massachusetts i am always worried of weather_conditions when traveling , travelocity told me that the cancelled flight was a weather issue , while jetblue told me it was a crew issue .
negative	i was given the run_around during very late hours .
negative	after all was done , we were stranded at the airport 0 hours from home with no transportation home .
negative	in my opinion this was a horrible experience all around .
negative	i am an understanding and patient person , but this pushed limits .
negative	my husband , taking the week off of work , lost hours at his job .
negative	we were given little to no options or help / flexibility from your travelocity representatives .
negative	we are devastated and disappointed and will never use travelocity as a means for travel_arrangements in the future !
negative	i thank_you for the opportunity to right this review .
negative	i already gave my opinion above .
negative	i '_m not happy with my purchase .
negative	i ordered a navy dress and received a blue dress .- not a navy dress
negative	they are fine to use until you have a problem !
negative	read other review sites and you '_ll soon get the picture .
negative	their returns_policy is against your consumer rights .
negative	your rights override anything they puts in their own terms and conditions .
negative	the item they sent me was faulty and yet they wanted me to pay for my delivery back to them and were refusing to refund the original postage .
negative	after many emails back and forth ( very slow in reply ) and after quoting them my rights , they finally agreed to a full_refund .
negative	in the end after another month they deined ever receiving my returned item and so i got nothing .
negative	not a replacement item , no refund and had paid for the return postage .
negative	absolute joke - will never use again .
negative	please_note - when i had bought previous items from them everything had been fine - but ask yourself if it is worth the risk ?
negative	believe me , it became more about the principle rather_than the money in the end .
negative	frustrating doesn_'_t even begin to cover it !
negative	like i said .... search on other review sites and you '_ll see the same comments .
negative	wish i had read them first !

negative	i ordered a book that was 0 volumes , and when i ordered it from bookbyte it said it was a 0 volume set .
negative	when i received it in the mail , which took much longer_than any other site i '_ve rented from , i only received one of the volumes .
negative	i tried to find a number to call , but the only number available is to corporate and they told me they couldn_'_t help me .
negative	what type of company doesn_'_t have a customer_service number to call ?
negative	so i had to email bookbyte to tell them of my problem .
negative	instead of trying to remedy the situation , they just refunded my money and said they didn_'_t have the other volume .
negative	they shouldn_'_t say they are renting a 0 volume set if they only have one volume .
negative	i had to take time out of my day to mail back the rental and find a replacement .
negative	if they had specified that it was only one of the volumes , i wouldn_'_t have rented it in the first place .
negative	we ordered tickets to go to las_vegas and stay at circus circus .
negative	the fine_print was so hard to read and their were surprise charges left out of the brief synopsis .
negative	what was supposed to be relaxing was nearly ruined by all of this .
negative	had it not been for free or cheap game play we would not have been able to have fun at all .
negative	i bought furniture on buy now pay later , i paid two_days before the due date but got charged alot of interest as they say it wasnt processed to my account til the day after the bnpl .
negative	i complained to customer_service and asked my account to be put on hold until this dispute was resolved , they then charged me late payment fees .
negative	i told them i have complained to financial ombusman , trading_standards , watchdog , citizens advice etc and they have said it will take between 0 - 0_weeks to reply .
negative	very told me i have to pay even_though my account is in dispute and i have been a good customer for years always paying on time .
negative	i am disgusted and feel totally ripped_off and would warn anyone thinking of buying on bnpl go with argos or another company as very is terrible .
negative	am so unhappy about my recent order .
negative	it took more than four days to notify me that some of my items were out of stock .
negative	i placed the order on the 00th_october and i still_haven_'_t receive it .
negative	when i called the customer_service wasn_'_t nice .
negative	am so upset now .
negative	terrible customer_service .
negative	obviously don_'_t care if the customer is happy .
negative	i could have been a great customer for many years to come , but you blew it .
negative	misleading sites .
negative	books not described correctly .
negative	workbooks listed as " study guides " in small_print - easy to miss , listed with wrong picture , listed along side the other textbooks .
negative	easily to mistake for a textbook .
negative	why is it when i searched the isbn_number for my textbook , the workbook came up ??
negative	no wonder i accidentally purchased the wrong thing .
negative	because you falsely listed the book in the wrong section and made me pay for return shipping .
negative	it ’_s not true .
negative	i took them up on their offer of “ guaranteed booking or your money back ”, i paid £_000 . 00 in march_0000 .
negative	after a year with them i have not had any bookings , so i emailed several_times asking for my money back and got no response .
negative	i even posted a message on their facebook_page , which has now mysteriously disappeared and some one responded saying that they had been trying , unsuccessfully , to contact me .
negative	huh !
negative	my email address and phone_number is on all my messages and on the owners rentals website .
negative	i doubt i will ever see my money !
negative	they are crooks !
negative	your facebook advertisement made it seem as if we would get 0 bullysticks for . 00_cents for a limited time and if we didn_'_t the offer would be revoked .
negative	i hurriedly ordered the " sticks " on my iphone and didn_'_t notice till after the transaction was completed that the offer was actually for . 00_cents for " each " bullystick and your limit was five .
negative	the facebook promo was very misleading and i would have never accepted that offer had i know i would be paying $ 0 . 00 in shipping fees for a . 00 cent item that turned_out to be only one half of the orginial retail size .
negative	i will not recommend this product and i will warn all my facebook contact whenever i spot anymore pet . flow promotions .
negative	i ordered a specific type of hair , but got a horrible batch !!!!
negative	as soon as i washed it , it tangled so bad and was matted to the point where i was unable to comb it out !
negative	i emailed you all for a refund and you kept ignoring what i was saying and gave_me the run_around for weeks until i stopped trying !
negative	waste of $_000 !
negative	i will never spend my money on you all again .
negative	the product i ordered , vinco '_s transdermapro cream , comes in a tub and is 0 % progesterone .
negative	this is what the website pictures .
negative	the product i received came in a tube and is 0 % progesterone .
negative	when i called in , i was not satisfied with the response .
negative	all i got out of the conversation is that vinco has switched to this new version of the product .
negative	i was given no warning of this or asked if the substitute product would be alright .
negative	very mediocre customer_service .... no apology or acknowledgement that the wrong product was sent .
negative	in my opinion , this was false_advertising .
negative	anna keah
negative	run away , quickly !!!
negative	they confirmed for the wrong date .
negative	i wrote 0 emails , called the next_day ( i had scheduled late at night -- my fault ).
negative	the representative said that they could change the reservation for a higher_rate -- would i agree ?
negative	i did , since i needed the hotel room for that night .
negative	i agreed , especially after i was informed that there may not be a room available since there was a shortage ( their website stated that only one room remained at the hotel i requested ).
negative	she would call the hotel and call me back on my cell in 00 - 00_minutes .
negative	she asked if i had contacted the hotel ; at that point , i had not .
negative	after waiting two hours and not receiving a return call , i called the hotel_directly .
negative	they confirmed that i had a reservation for that evening .
negative	imagine my surprise when i entered the hotel and was told my reservation was made by expedia , not easytobook .
negative	i had not contacted expedia about any reservations ( ever !)
negative	also , imagine my surprise when my credit_card was charged by easytobook for over $_00 when my credit_card receipt from the hotel was $_00 .
negative	as i said , run away .
negative	i will never use this service and will encourage all of my friends and business associates to find another source .
negative	very very disappointed have ordered 0 garment steamers none has come raspberry cotona tabs and patches sliming chocolate nothing has come .
negative	the only_thing that has come is a tin opener and that broke the first time l used it went in the bin , very reluctant to order anything as nothing arrives l always pay pay pall at time of order there is always money in my account l cannot understand who '_t is going on and wonder is it only me that is not getting who '_t thay order l wonder is this any way to run a company l had a company befor l retierd and never treated my customers like this and l was dealing_with people all the time it would be nice to to get an answer .
negative	if you receive the part you order there are no_issues .
negative	however , i am_currently dealing_with an_issue where i was sent used ( core ) calipers instead of new or remanufactured as ordered .
negative	i '_ve been trying to remedy this situation for a week now with no results as of yet .
negative	you are not able to contact anyone by phone .
negative	issues are dealt through e_- m . read there fine_print before ordering .
negative	order at your own risk .
negative	i have to this day never received my order as the delivery company are rubbish !!!!
negative	please boohoo start using a better courier service so i can start ordering again :-((((
negative	beware !!!
negative	check the trustpilot reviews and you will see there are some suspiciously good reviews and for approximately every four of those , there is a shocker !
negative	i have just bought a bathroom from them and sadly looked at the reviews after my purchase .
negative	the bath , cistern and sink had to be replaced bacause they arrived broken .
negative	the quality of the loo_seat and the bath panels is terrible and the last job for the plumber was to fit the loo and the cistern filler didn_'_t work and we had to go and buy a new one .
negative	when you call them , the telephone_number is a premium line - if you do go_ahead and buy from them , my advice is to ask them to call you back .
negative	it takes_forever to get through to customer_services , but the sales department pick the phone up after one ring .
negative	complaints to the owner of the business are ignored .
negative	if i was you , i would save up a bit longer - you get what you pay for .
negative	i ordered a 00_lb_bag of friskies for cats - it was $_00 . 00 ...
negative	i have five cats and four dogs - my son said i paid too much as it was $_00 . 00 at krogers and less at
negative	i brought a sixteen pound_bag of friskes for cats for $_00 . 00 from you - i have five cats and four dogs - living on social_security - i found most of your prices reasonable and no sales_tax and delived to my home is convenient .
negative	my son said i paid too much as it is sold at krogers for $_00 . 00 and walmart for less .
negative	i bet him $ 0 . 00 dollars he was wrong as there could not be that much of a price difference .
negative	on senior_citizens day he took me shopping as normal and then showed me the bag - he was correct plus i would have gotten an extra 00_%_off .
negative	i called your company and told them that there was too much of a difference in price - even a $ 0 . 00 credit would have made me happy .
negative	i worked in sales for 00 years and i never lost a customer - and i worked with million dollar contracts and i treated the person_who may have only bought $_000 the same as a bigger customer .
negative	never lose a customer for bad service especially when you are wrong as that could impact a hundred more customers .... would i recommend you no ... angies list is a great equalizer - we live in an electronic society remember that .... you lost five different orders due to that policies and believe me bulk buying does not impress me as an excuse especially when that is that much of a price difference ............
negative	extremely disappointed with kwik_fit who promised much and delivered little on my purchase of tyres for a home fitted service .
negative	i booked online for a time to suit me and received a call a few hours_later to confirm the tyres would be fitted on the day and time i had booked .
negative	great !
negative	i then re - arranged my schedule to ensure i would be home for the allotted_time and someone could pick my kids up .
negative	then the night before i got another call from kwik_fit dispatcher (!)
negative	saying they could not do it on the agreed scheduled and confirmed time but instead would offer a different appointment at a time to suit them from 0 til 0 . 00_pm a day later !
negative	this is completely_unacceptable and i was given no_explanation for this complete and utter rubbish service other than for this new guy saying that the person_who had initially called me earlier had no_idea about their schedule and her confirmation that the appointment would take place meant nothing and could not be relied_upon !
negative	i felt totally and utterly shafted as obviously kwik_fit had already taken my money and refused to refund it to me so i could go elsewhere .
negative	rubbish and i will never use them again and am making sure i tell_everyone i know about the completely rubbish , unreliable and untrustwoirthy service .
negative	avoid at all costs .
negative	go to halfords who i have used before and only did not use on this occassion beacause the initial confirmed dates offered by kwik_fit were more convenient to me .
negative	obviously this turned_out to be a complete lie and fabrication of any availability they actually had or they just picked and choosed whose appointments they fulfilled and decided for themselves when they do the appointments irrespective of the date or time you have booked .
negative	avoid kwik_fit .
negative	i ordered a part from partsgeek and it was the wrong part .
negative	i do not know if it was my fault or the fault of the parts dept there .
negative	however , the return process with this company is a nightmare .
negative	they don_'_t put a packing_slip in with the part so there is no way to tell if they sent the correct_part or not !
negative	then to return the item , is an_absolute joke !
negative	they claim they have to send me an_rma form but i have yet to see one .
negative	each time i try to contact them , i get a response that " a representative will be with me in 00_hours "....
negative	this is going on now for about 0 days !
negative	i still have not received an " rma " form to return the freaking part !
negative	bottom_line : if you think the prices are good and that you might save a few_dollars - wrong !!
negative	just go to your local parts store and pay the full price .
negative	at_least they will return the part if they make a mistake !
negative	i had an item to be collected for return , they did not collect .
negative	rescheduled , they did not collect .
negative	i phoned and waited 00_mins ( at my expense ) i was informed the wait time would be 00_minutes .
negative	i was told that < private_data_removed_> from complaints would return my call in a minute , after 0 hours i went out .
negative	i e_- mailed a complaint , no reply .
negative	i phoned again , was told by < private_data_removed_> that the item would be collected by 0pm that night , it was collected at 0pm , i was also told that < private_data_removed_> would contact me the next_morning to confirm collection .
negative	that was00 days ago and yet again no phone_call , i do not hold out much hope .
negative	absolutely usless !!
negative	and all at my time and expense
negative	service ?
negative	what service !!!!!
negative	oh and i was told that they do not give compensation for phone_calls made at my expense even_though the problem was caused by yodel .
negative	i would not consider ordering again , quality of the shoes were horrible and so cheap !
negative	when they arrived , i tugged a little on the suade boots i ordered and they ripped !!!
negative	i guess i got what i paid for , but had initially thought that the products would be the same as those on <_external linke removed_> and would have the same quality .
negative	i learned my mistake and i will only be ordering from <_external linke removed_> from now on .
negative	called for reservations at a hampton_inn .
negative	was told could get me reservations at another nearby .
negative	i took that to mean a hampton .
negative	was quoted a price .
negative	i asked if an aarp_discount would make it cheaper .
negative	was told i was being given the cheapest price available .
negative	after all the credit details were taken i was given the address and it wasn_'_t a hampton it was a baymont inn .
negative	also when we arrived i found out i could have gotten it cheaper with aarp , but couldn_'_t then because i booked with reservation_counter .
negative	the place was a dump .
negative	we didn_'_t take showers because the bathroom was so bad , loose tiles , black on the grout , and so small you couldn_'_t turn_around .
negative	with 0 small_children and the late hour we stayed .
negative	but i felt tricked by reservation_counter .
negative	their web_site was extrtremely misleading .
negative	it looked like i was on hampton_inn '_s site and was calling the reservation number for hampton_inn .
negative	extremely angry and disappointed in this company .
negative	please be careful and don_'_t be misled like me .
negative	be sure what web_site you are on !!!!!

negative	i ordered for the first time a month or so ago .
negative	i ordered two dresses and three tops .
negative	i returned both the dresses and one of the tops .
negative	these three items had a total of 00_pounds but i was only refunded 00 .
negative	i do not know why 0 pounds was deducted and this is unacceptable .
negative	one evening i made a reservation for airplane flights with travelocity to fly cross_country , and got an_email_confirming those reservation .
negative	next_morning i got a call from travelocity telling_me that the flights were not confirmed , in fact there were no seats left on those flights , and that if i wanted a reservation for that same day it would cost me $_000 more , take it or leave it .
negative	i was on the phone for over an_hour , didn_'_t matter that i had a confirmation in hand - too bad .
negative	i never_heard of such a thing !!
negative	as i had to be somewhere on the given day , i eventually , after getting nowhere with various supervisors .
negative	made a new reservation that cost me about $_000 more than the original one .
negative	i am furious with you , hope to never make a reservation with travelocity again , and will bad - mouth your confirmed - but - not - really !
negative	service whenever_possible .
negative	i ordered 0 things and only got 0 .
negative	the thing i didn_'_t order had a r beside it but i don_'_t know what that means .
negative	your site is awful especially if i don_'_t get all the things i ordered
negative	we are having a family_reunion in nashville aug . 0 , 0 , and check out on the 00th .
negative	other members of our family have already made reservations so when i called to make reservations in order for us to have rooms close to each other , the woman at the booking desk gave_me a rate of $_000 . 00 per_night which was $_00 . 00 more than what was offered online .
negative	i told her that everyone else informed me they were being charged $_000 . 00 instead of the $_000 . 00 your clerk quoted .
negative	when i told her the online web_site quoted $_000 . 00 , she very sarcastically said to me " well , then you should book your room online then ".
negative	she sounded extremely_rude , not helpful at all , quite curt and didn_'_t give the opportunity to tell her of our other family_members who are being charged $_000 . 00 per_night .
negative	the only_reason i tried to book over the phone was to insure i could get a room near , or at_least on the same floor as my family_reunion members .
negative	for certain , my niece spoke with someone to make reservations for 0 families , so i know the $_000 . 00 rate is available by phone reservations .
negative	if everyone wasn_'_t staying at that hotel , believe me i would find a friendlier place to stay .
negative	i have since booked our room for aug . 0 , 0 and check out on the 00th .
negative	the on duty reservation desk_clerk was not good representation for you at all .
negative	i booked my cruise with travelocity with several promotions included .
negative	the person booking the reservation had a lot of trouble making the booking but after 0 phone_calls they finally supposedly had my reservation made .
negative	one of the promotions was a 0 day condo stay which required activation of a code through email precisely 00 days after booking .
negative	i waited 00 days never received an_email .
negative	as a matter of fact i never got an_email_confirmation of the reservation at all .
negative	i called the help desk at travelocity and they informed me the reservation was never completed because they believed the payment had not been made in full when in fact it was ( paid by credit_card ).
negative	they finally put the reservation through to norwegian cruise lines , but i still had yet to get a confirmation from travelocity .
negative	part of the promotions was $_00 in cruise credits .
negative	the day of the cruise departure on the ship , i found out that i would not receive the credit because i had never received an_email to fill_out a form .
negative	the agent on the phone could do nothing for me but claim to send me another email after they reviewed the audio tapes from my several conversations .
negative	they promised an_email by the end of my cruise , but to no surprise there was no follow_up email .
negative	i have no_intention of ever booking with travelocity again and i plan to make_sure everyone i know and work with knows what a terrible experience i '_ve had .
negative	i ordered an evisa card .
negative	i never got notification that the transaction went through .
negative	i called customer_service and they said the ordered was cancelled on their side , but she didn_'_t know why .
negative	i reordered the card and again never got notification either way .
negative	no money was ever debited from my account , so that was good .
negative	i just gave up .
negative	i tried_calling , i didn_'_t know you couldn_'_t speak to a representative , so i put a claim ticket in twice , and i didn_'_t receive a call back .. this is very bad for people that '_s spending their money ..!

negative	i recently booked a reservation with hostelworld . com for one night in a 0 bed female dorm at yha wellington .
negative	upon_arrival at the hostel they told me that there is no reservation .
negative	i am very disappointed that hostelworld . com didn ’ t make a reservation , but charged me for their service .
negative	i wrote several_times to hostelworld . com regarding what has happened .
negative	never got an answer or apology and still_waiting for repayment .
negative	on their website the they ask :
negative	why use hostelworld . com ?
negative	answer :
negative	00 , 000 properties , 000 countries
negative	000_% booking guarantee
negative	over 0 . 0 million guest reviews
negative	" 000_% booking guarantee " that is not true !!
negative	!
negative	i utilized the companies online tool to determine what part i need for my part ; based on their tool , i ordered part .
negative	the part did not fit and when used chipped part of car .
negative	i sent a note to customer_service , they issued a return rma .
negative	the return required for me to pay shipping , even_though , their software said it would work .
negative	so , long_story short , to ship part to me $ 0 . 00 to return part $ 0 . 00 .
negative	the part was only $ 0 ....
negative	worst deal and experience so_far with online shopping .
negative	thank_you for exactly the right part , easy to read and order website and fast service on delivery !
negative	i had a mechanic try and install the part that you sent and it doesn_'_t work at all .
negative	i have to pay him for his time for a part that is garbage .
negative	part ordered and paid for was lost in shipping several_attempts to contact company via_email and phone once i finally found a good #.
negative	attempted contact via phone was on hold 0 different times then line was disconnected every time .
negative	place email with no response attempted 0nd email and that was not allowed as i already had an open ticket .
negative	now i have my credit_card company involved so that i can get resolution .
negative	booked my first trip with expedia in october_0000 .
negative	my flight was cancelled i was on my way to the airport and i found out when i called the airline !!!
negative	expedia did not notify me !!
negative	!
negative	booked my second trip for may 00 0000 .
negative	both my departing flight and return flight was changed and once again i was not notified !!!
negative	!
negative	when i called their customer_service department to complain .
negative	i was transfered so many_times that i was hung_up on twice .
negative	when i called back the 0rd time a supervisor said sorry we regret loosing you as a customer but there '_s nothing i can do .
negative	i travel an average of 0 times per year for personal trips and 00 times for business .
negative	i will never book with expedia again !
negative	thanks for the horrible service !
negative	i had a terrible experience with bookit . com when i booked my vacation week !
negative	first of all , they overcharged my credit_card by charging my hotel twice !
negative	and then they actually placed a recurring charge on my account which my credit_card had to explain to me what it was -- bookit . com would charged my account every_month for the amount i paid for the hotel !
negative	not good !
negative	of course , my bank blocked bookit . com from charging my account !
negative	i noticed right_away and called them ( bookit . com ) and spoke with 0 different customer serivce rep -- none of them could find what was overcharged !
negative	one of them told me the overcharge wasn_'_t there anymore .
negative	the last customer rep blamed it on my credit_card company for allowing this extra_charge ?
negative	really ?
negative	your company charged my account not my bank ???
negative	( my bank did actually credit my account again ).
negative	i called the hotel and the airline just to be sure all was in order before i left for my vacation - the hotel couldn_'_t find my reservation cause bookit . com had misspelled my last name ?
negative	really ?
negative	when i booked , i got a 000 $ restaurant . com gc -- wasn_'_t able to use on vacation cause bookit . com never sent me a confirmation code ... great company huh ?
negative	so as of today which is almost 0 months after i initially booked -- i haven_'_t received any paperwork form my bank that the claim is closed ... i did speak with another rep from bookit . com after i wrote them a long email , and she said that my credit_card / bank had been refunded .
negative	she said it takes 0_weeks for the money to get to them ?
negative	really ?
negative	your company stole money out of my account ?
negative	and now we have to wait for the credit ?
negative	be careful -- pay the extra 00 - 000 $ with another company !
negative	i would not recommend anyone to book trough bookit . com !
negative	still_waiting for my next_day delivery or refund 00 days on !
negative	terrible experience and would never shop with them again .
negative	what a nightmare .
negative	travelocity ain '_t what it used to be . i stayed on hold so long it was like an endurance test .
negative	i sp0ke to one representative who couldn_'_t even speak_english .
negative	he was from a third world county ,.
negative	he got my entire reservation wrong .
negative	luckily when i didn_'_t get my email_confirmation i called adn foudn this out .
negative	again you suck .
negative	then i spoke to a second representative who spoke alittle bit better .
negative	however i have nooooo confidence in employees who can '_t speak good english .
negative	i will never use your site again ,.
negative	i got charged for amount on my visa immediately and it was not told to me .
negative	then hadd to change an get billed again .
negative	then was told would take a week to get my refund .
negative	i want my money now from my refund .
negative	i will steer everyone away from you and lesson_learned call the hotel_directly .
negative	you can email me at depageantgirl @ verizon ,. net
negative	i booked an expensive room in nyc , planning to spend the night with two adults and two children .
negative	the hotel informed me that no more than two people could be permitted in the room , and that only priceline customer_service could fix the problem ( by allowing their " king_room " with sofa_bed ).
negative	the other alternative of course was that i pay for an extra room at their exhorbitant price .
negative	i called priceline customer_service , which sounded_like a call_center in india , and after a long wait , they would do nothing more than read a passage to me saying that all rooms are nonrefundable .
negative	no service at all , just delay and unpleasantness .
negative	it is not okay when traveling to arrive at the hotel with tired children and find that you can not actually be permitted to stay in the room you already paid for .
negative	( fortunately , we found out before actually leaving home , but feel_cheated of quite a lot of money .)
negative	very very bad customer_service , administration stuck in the last century .
negative	to my detailed personal complaint i received a " copy / paste " terms and conditions - not even relating to my issues !
negative	they could not even be bothered reading the complaint !
negative	vowed to avoid , vowed to never recommend - vowed to warn people about a company that rips you off , and does not care about their business reputation or customers .
negative	my gripe is with city_link but booked through interparcel - appalling
negative	i ordered sunglasses 0_weeks_ago .
negative	i still don_'_t have them .
negative	there were problems with the delivery .
negative	i had tracked it & the address that they had given was incorrect therefore they couldn_'_t delivery it .
negative	i emailed the customer_service to say i hadn_'_t received them & explained the delivery company was given the wrong_address .
negative	the reply was that they had been sent .
negative	i emailed back again stating that i knew that & there was clearly a problem with the delivery .
negative	the response showed the address i had entered for them to be delivered ( which was correct ) & to contact the delivery company
negative	terrible customer_service .
negative	there is no rating this company .
negative	rating of 0
negative	i don_'_t care how long they have been in service
negative	web_site is a blanket cover
negative	shouldn_'_t be allowed to do_business
negative	the led_light was garbage .
negative	out of the 0 that i bought , not a single one of them worked .
negative	you might as well say that i threw away $ 0 . 00 that could have been put to good use .
negative	never use again
negative	i am writing this review to help future or current customers .
negative	trust me , do not use this company .
negative	there are so many other_sites that i trust to sell , rent , and buy textbooks from .
negative	textbooksrus claims that they did not quote me prices for my books before i mailed them all in .
negative	you have to be out of your mind to think that i would send in books that were worth ( literally ) hundreds of dollars if i wasn_'_t sure i would receive a check !
negative	isn_'_t that common_sense ?!
negative	then , textbooksrus says that they only received one or two of my books ... i sent about 00 .
negative	they just " didn_'_t receive " them .
negative	i do a ton of online shopping , sales , etc_., and have never had this happen .
negative	the few they received apparently " did not match " the ones i said i was sending .
negative	moral of the story : spread the word , this company is a joke and they will lose your books , say they didn_'_t quote you prices online that they did , and claim they never received your books .
negative	it makes me sick to think these bitches are making a profit .
negative	run , as fast as you can !
negative	i have not received my 0 loungers yet
negative	ordered a used workbook that is completely filled out already , book was supposed to be in " good " condition , i consider this to be " terrible " condition - why would i want a book ready totally used and filled out !?
negative	this should have been disclosed , would have never purchased .
negative	i inquired_about returning the $ 0 book and was told shipping , which came in at $_00 for me to send back , would not be reimbursed .
negative	looks like i '_m stuck with this awful product .
negative	will never order from this company again .
negative	dishonest disclosures and unreasonable customer_service .
negative	poor customer_service , to long for funds , to long on hold 0 hr , rush off the phone quickly , not ordering anymore from your company , have been a customer of yours for 0_yrs and have spent_thousands of dollars , still_waiting on a refund from a order on 00 / 0 / 00 refunds incorrect amounts
negative	i received a pair of earring in lieu of two_pairs of boots !
negative	what kind of operation are you running there !
negative	you are not available to answer your phones .
negative	one hour is to long to hear from you .
negative	you suck ,.
negative	our booking stated 0 hour 00_minutes approximately , for our transfer to agios nikalaos from heraklion .
negative	from boarding the coach to arriving at the resort it was 0 hours .
negative	the person meeting us at our accommodation had given us up and gone home .
negative	we had been travelling since 0 . pm the previous day with 0 children age 0 and 0 years .
negative	our confirmation of booking states ' they will be responsible for your smooth and efficient transportation from and to the airport ; we guarantee you will be arriving at your destination on time ' we did not risk the transfer back , and took the local bus instead .
negative	however | know of others who took the transfer back to the airport , the journey again took longer_than_expected and they had to rush at the airport .
negative	we contacted resorthoppa only to be told the time quoted was only and estimate .
negative	i contacted them further , several_times , requesting their abta number , but never received a reply .
negative	i have since contacted abta who tell me the company are not a member .
negative	i have taken advise from trading_standards and have written to resorthoppa again requesting a reply within 00 days .
negative	we will never use this company again .
negative	i ordered several_times from amniclubwear . com over the last few_years .
negative	usually there are no_problems .
negative	but this last time i ordered two items .
negative	they charged me for both but only received one of the items .
negative	i have all the emails and copy of the order .
negative	i tried 0 times in the last few_months to ask them to either send the item or receive a store credit for the balance or my money back .
negative	i was nice about it ..... not abusive in any way .
negative	i did not get any answer from any of my emails .
negative	it '_s been at_least 0 months now and i know they will never contact me .
negative	so now they '_ve lost a dedicated customer ..... over $_00 . 00 .
negative	all they needed to do was reply to my emails and try to resolve it .
negative	do not order from them if for no other reason that communication is non_- existent .
negative	it truly was the worst_experience .
negative	reservations were made at the wrong hotel .
negative	to cancel , it would take 00_hours to credit back my credit_card .
negative	correct reservation was never able to be made .
negative	i have to wait and see what damage was done to my credit_card .
negative	all total , they made 0 cancellations and no successful reservation .
negative	poor communications , slow in refunding as item unavailable despite_being on website and able to purchase .
negative	attitude poor on the telephone .
negative	will not buy again from this company
negative	i acquired my reservations through_expedia ( unbeknown to me that i was not talking to someone with the hotel ) and prepaid the expense but upon_arrival did not have the reservation requested nor could i get it , nor could i receive a refund , nor could i contact anyone with expedia to solve the problem … therefore i won_'_t ever do_business with expedia again ( knowingly ) and i will tell_everyone i can my experience !
negative	i was almost afraid to walk to my room , the grass was calf high , swimming_pool had not been used in forever , had a cover and chairs on top , the building was falling_apart and had not had anything done to it since it was built , microwave had food stains inside , mold in frig , i walked out as soon as i could call and cancel .
negative	this hotel should be taken off the list !!
negative	opened the door and could not stand the smell .
negative	however , the lady at the desk was pleasant and the girl who checked on me was nice , i guess they were wondering_if the room was ok ...... not !!!!
negative	the hotel i requested had a room when i called direct , so that will be my next route .
negative	they did say they were going to credit my card ..... sure hope that happens !!!
negative	the lady that helped_me from the reservation company was very nice .
negative	i ordered bottles over a week a go and they are not here
negative	their book app sucks .
negative	doesn_'_t work right .
negative	selected a flight and after_submitting it put me in the wrong flight .
negative	had to call and get it resolved .
negative	then they charged me twice on flight .
negative	told me it takes 00 to 00 days to remove extra_charge .
negative	they do not try to help their customer .
negative	go elsewhere .
negative	i will be brutally honest .
negative	booking my hotel was no problem but when it came to changing my reservation it was a nightmare .
negative	i went to my account with my reservation details where i should have been able to change my reservation from 0 rooms to 0 rooms .
negative	no_matter_how many_times i refreshed the website or hit the buttons to change it , nothing happened .
negative	so then out of frustration i tried to cancel my reservation by hitting the cancellation button ..... many_times .... again nothing happened .
negative	the next_day i called their customer_service .... not much_better .
negative	the connection was terrible and because the reservation technically went through_expedia my customer_service person had to call them and call me back to cancel one of my rooms .
negative	this only took a few_minutes but i never received an_email receipt or confirmation code .
negative	the next_day i look at my account and it still has me listed as being reserved for 0 rooms .
negative	so now i try calling back .... and after calling about 00 times with no answer or answering_machine to leave a message i just went straight to the source and called expedia .
negative	expedia took_care of my immediately and sent me confirmation code and email .
negative	will never use this service again .
negative	and the nightmare continues .
negative	a week after being promised a full_refund i still had not received it and decided to call easybook again .... kill me now .
negative	when you call easybook not only do you have to wait forever but you have to listen to the most god awful sound while waiting .
negative	it sounds like a broken alarm clock .
negative	after waiting for ten_minutes to finally talk to someone i was answered by a girl who couldn_'_t hear me due to a bad connection .
negative	mind you i am calling from an iphone 0 that i never have problems with .
negative	then she has the audacity to ask me to call her back due to the bad connection .
negative	wtf !!!
negative	i finally got her to write down my phone_number to call me back .
negative	of course 0 hours_later i hadn_'_t heard_anything .
negative	then i called back and after waiting for 00_minutes and not being_able to handle the alarm sound anymore i hung_up .
negative	highly encourage_anyone thinking of using this site to think_twice about their decision .
negative	still_waiting for my refund ... wont hold my breath .
negative	truly the worst customer_service / difficult company i have ever had to work with ever .
negative	my girlfriend gave_me a gift_card to white_flower farms when my brother passed_away .
negative	she wanted me to purchase a plant for my garden in remembrance of him .
negative	i fell in love with the lungwort that i purchased locally for $ 0 . 00 , so i decided to give two other varieties a try .
negative	i purchased these other varieties of lungworts from wff with my gift_card and was extremely disappointed .
negative	they arrived root bound , yellow , near death and they were over priced .
negative	i have placed them in ground and can only hope for the best .
negative	signed ,
negative	disappointed in va
negative	this is messed_up man . waiting for a package that was said to be delivered and no package .... dont_know who to blame ?
negative	shopping like this is terrible
negative	delivered a broken controller and i have called and sent emails with no response ..
negative	i am very disgruntled with this company .
negative	i did not spend over $_000 for a controller for it to be broken .
negative	and with no response from the company .
negative	i was trying to change my flight return date which took them 00_minutes to understand what i wanted to do after being hung_up on once .
negative	after waiting for them to contact me back ( twice ringing the wrong number to whatt i gave them ) i am told that it is going to cost me an_additional 00pounds to change it .
negative	after looking online the flight was only 00pounds to book it all again letalone just to change the flight that i have already paid for .
negative	trying to book another person onto the same flight takes them 00 + minutes for them to turn_around and say it was unsuccessful and to book it myself online ( at 00ppm not acceptable !!!!)
negative	i will never use this company to book any flights again and would not reccomend anyone_else to do so either .
negative	not very impressed order number 000000 )
negative	address top flat
negative	000 fellows road
negative	belsize park
negative	nw0 0jj
negative	mandy nelson telephone no which was given with the order is 0000000000
negative	cell 00000000000
negative	i get getting confirmation that order has_been received it hasn_'_t . cost of flowers was 00 . 00_pounds
negative	verydissapointed customer .
negative	when i tried to call it said webpage cannot be opened
negative	have a volvo and can '_t get parts for it where we live i found this site and the part we needed was a heater core with o - rings some sites sell them separate this site said specifically it came with both .
negative	got the order no o - rings in box .
negative	contact them .
negative	them assume box damage .
negative	told them no , then instead of sending me the missing parts they want me to return the part at my expense !!!!!!!!
negative	!
negative	my experience was very disappointing .
negative	i had a reservation to park and shuttle to the airport unfortunately when i arrived at the hotel i was told i could not park in the lot because i did not stay at the hotel , subsequently i had to park at the airport and incur an outrageous fee !!
negative	i reported the incident to customer_service at global_parking and was told by two individuals , carolyn and amanda that unfortunately there was nothing that could be done about the expense that was incurred .
negative	as an individual who travels frequently finding a reliable parking service is important .
negative	when there is a break in communication with the hotel and the parking service the customer should be compensated for the inconvenience .
negative	the " little " inconvenience cost me a late arrival to the airport and a $_000 . 00 to park at the airport .
negative	definitely a horrible experience and poor customer_service !
negative	ok ... so i ordered over_£_000 worth of isme products , the delivery was super quick but half the goods werent great quality and i was extremely disappointed to find that when i phoned up isme to sort out the 00_%_off i hadnt managed to retrieve because of my bad connection ... they tried to tell me its not 00_%_off first time customers , its £_00 off your first £_00 ...
negative	i know what i can see thank_you very much so dont try telling_me i can see something_else .
negative	in the end i kept two products for covienience and wrote an_email to them for proof of what is on my samsung_galaxy
negative	screen but the connection was also bad it wouldnt send so i left it at that and can_honestly say im much happier with very and paying p_& p on call of duty black_ops 0 ... whats that about !
negative	its not a big product and should be eligible for collect +!!!
negative	!
negative	i hate the way they don_'_t pay their employees fairly , and the fact that they discriminate against women !
negative	also the fact that almost everything they buy comes from china !
negative	i live in billings , but manage several properties in san_diego .
negative	cox continually " mistakenly " overcharges my account month after month .
negative	their customer_service representatives are rude and their overall level of service is terribly unsatisfactory .
negative	go with at & t if the option is available in your area .
negative	i was sent a skirt and it was all ripped at the bottom .
negative	i have sent this skirt back to you and i still_haven_'_t received my money back ..
negative	i will never use priceline again !
negative	made reservations through them for a hotel in boston this weekend .
negative	when we decided to add a night and extend our stay directly through the hotel , we found out that we had saved very little money by booking with priceline .
negative	an_unexpected emergency arose , forcing us to cancel our plans .
negative	when we called priceline to try to exchange or get a refund , the answer was no , while the hotel very cordially canceled our reservations and refunded our money for the night we had booked directly through them .
negative	this has taught me a lesson , and i will be booking my reservations through someone_else next time .
negative	increasing my rent 00 . 0 % in one month with no notice , and when i called customer_service , they promised it might happen again next month !
negative	bad business_practice !
negative	terrible experience .
negative	was sent the wrong part ( without an invoice in the packaging ), so i had to wait a couple of days to be issued an_rma_number before i could return the part ... and i had to pay return shipping fees for sending the wrong part back !!
negative	now , i '_ll have to wait for them to receive the returned item and wait another 00 days for the credit .
negative	it may have been a good price for the part itself , but boy oh_boy do you pay for it in the end .
negative	we '_ve ordered twice from groupon and both_times we have been severely disappointed .
negative	the first order was for 0 x dehumidifiers .
negative	we had no communication to let us know that they had been dispatched and then when one of them finally arrived 00 days_later , we were left_wondering when or if the second would turn arrive .
negative	i called groupon customer_services to query ( if you want to waste an_hour of your life , call the groupon customer_service line !)
negative	the girl i spoke to on the phone would not confirm whether 0 or 0 had been sent .
negative	i told her my parcel said 0 of 0 so could only assume that only 0 had been sent .
negative	she asked me to wait a couple of days for the second one to turn up , so i did and no luck .
negative	i called back and requested a refund .... only to be told that they couldn_'_t refund my card , but could offer me the funds back in groupon credit !
negative	a few_months later and we saw a pair of ballerina pump shoes in a snake skin purple / pink metallic print , with 00_%_off .... who could pass up this opportunity !
negative	so we decided to give groupon a second chance ....( famous last words !)
negative	the shoes took around a week to arrive .... fair enough but yet again , no notification that they had been dispatched .
negative	when we received the item , the shoes were 0 different_colours !
negative	one was purple / pink and the other was green / yellow !
negative	we have learned our lesson - the deals may be great but the customer_service , delivery and general operations of this business are dire !
negative	for the sake of a saving , i ' d_rather spend a bit more and receive a good service than waste any more time with groupon !
negative	they charged my credit_card 0 times for the same part .
negative	you can not get through to customer_service and if you finally do , there is no response about taking_care of problem .
negative	if you call them , they will not call you back and forget the fax_machine .
negative	tried to get through for 00_hrs .
negative	if i don_'_t hear from someone today , i am contacting thr better business_bureau .
negative	i was sent the wrong shoes and still_haven_'_t been able to get someone on the phone after waiting 00_minutes on each_occasion for a leave a message recording comes on .
negative	left several messages and still_haven_'_t received a call back .
negative	never received a shipping confirmation either .
negative	will never order from this site again horrible service and poor customer_service .
negative	i ordered a mirror for my pt for the passenger_side and was sent a mirror for the driver_side .
negative	then i wrote to ask for returning information to exchange the mirror and was given a ticket number with the promise of 00 to 00 business hour response .
negative	it has_been 00_hours with out a response .
negative	the ups sent the mirror through ten different_cities .
negative	it was shipped without_any protection and had no packing_slip enclosed in the damaged box i received .
negative	how am i suppose to ship back a part without a packing_slip in a damaged box ?
negative	the glass frames were huge -- far too large for my face and the color was more zebra striped than grey tortoise .
negative	had no choice but to return them because of the size .
negative	returned them promptly , paid for the return shipping but received only a partial credit .
negative	will be less likely to " try " frames again from this website .
negative	i had ordered pads to absorb sweat under breasts andunder folds of fat under stomach .
negative	no way to aadhere to your body .
negative	this review is about 0 months late , but as i kept staring_at this email to write a review and putting it off , i decided i would .
negative	i have ordered from amiclubwear a few_times .
negative	i do like how the prices are competitive but the quality of some of the items are just down right horrible .
negative	i would rather pay extra money to have higher quality items that will last versus buying something that you only get a few uses out of .
negative	my last order was 0 pairs of boots .
negative	one for me and one as a christmas gift for my roomate .
negative	first off , the shipping was omg turtle slow .
negative	shipping is too high .
negative	so a big_disappointment with those 0 things .
negative	when i finally got them , i got excited .
negative	the moment i opened the box , i wanted to cry .
negative	first the smell .
negative	i don_'_t know how or why the smell was bad , but it was bad .
negative	second , the quality was just crap .
negative	one was a pair of fake suede boots .
negative	the black color wasn_'_t even black .
negative	the quality looked like cheap felt you buy in a dollar store and you could see glue where parts of the boots were supposed to be together .
negative	the second pair was fake leather but the shine on the boots was absolutely horrible .
negative	it looked like someone just vaselined the whole boots .
negative	the buckle part had threads showing and also glue showing and very very cheaply_made .
negative	unacceptable !!
negative	i called customer_service and spoke to a very rude lady_who said if i return them , there would be a restocking_fee ( what ??!!)
negative	and i could only get credit back and not my money back .
negative	unacceptable .
negative	plus she told me that all of their products are high_quality .
negative	umm no , they aren_'_t .
negative	obviously you could tell she was either having a bad day or she downright hated her job .
negative	very unprofessional !
negative	!
negative	i work in healthcare , and seeing patients every day , i know that i should always deliver high_quality care and professionalism at all times .
negative	and i do .
negative	so when i get crappy quality and unacceptable customer_service , i will say something .
negative	in hopes that other customers will know the quality and the business itself will actually change things .
negative	i am very very disappointed and will more than likely not recommend this website to others nor will i be making purchases as well .
negative	i would like a full_refund including shipping !
negative	!
negative	i ordered these pans about two and a half weeks before christmas .
negative	for a gift .
negative	did not receive them till january 00 .
negative	not impressed
negative	the customer_service of expedia is terrible !
negative	if you run_into problems they will not help you at all .
negative	after 0 hours on the phone talking to 0 different people , all i got was the phone_number for the airline '_s customer_service people !
negative	i have traveled using expedia several_times before .
negative	this was the 0st time i needed to use their 0 - 000 number .
negative	my flight was canceled due to weather .
negative	i called their number to find a solution .
negative	the agent on the other end told me that they would cancel my ticket if i found another flight .
negative	i found another flight and called back .
negative	after waiting on hold with the agent for 0 hours , i was told that , because of the inclement_weather , i needed to call back the next_day before_noon .
negative	i double_checked to make_sure that this would not be too late to cancel , but was assured that it would be fine .
negative	however , the next_morning when i called at 0 am , i was told that it was too late and that my original flight had been re scheduled .
negative	i was on the phone with the person for 0 / 0 an_hour explaining things before my new flight took off and i had to hang up .
negative	once i was back in cell service , i called the number again .
negative	this time i was told their system was down and that i would have to call them back in 0 hours .
negative	when i called them back i was on the phone again for another 0 hours until i was finally told that at no time could they have canceled the flight and that i should have contacted the airline_directly right_away !
negative	when i pointed_out that i had talked to 0 other people and none of them communicated this to me , i was told that they were sincerely sorry and that the people would be dealt_with , but that there was still nothing they could do for me !
negative	i will never use expedia for another flight .
negative	with all of the options out there , you can do better_than this site .
negative	don_'_t expect a refund or any further use of a ticket you purchase with these_folks if you should have to cancel your flight because of an_emergency .
negative	i read every word of the terms and conditions before i purchased , and nowhere does it say if you are travelling on two different airlines you will not be refunded or given the opportunity to reschedule in the future .
negative	they refunded the tax only ($_00 ) on a $_000 fare .
negative	pretty hefty fee .
negative	flyer beware .
negative	.
negative	.
negative	i ordered a trampoline for my sons_birthday_present .
negative	i ordered it 0_weeks in advance so it would get here on time .
negative	it never arrived and the blame was put on the courier company .
negative	its unacceptable as it states next_day delivery !
negative	i the customer had to contact sport and leisure to find out where my trampoline was .
negative	only then was i told that it was returned to them as the box was damaged .
negative	i have been cut_off by customer_services and nobody bothered to get back to me .
negative	i now have to wait even longer to have this delivered and have been told that i may not receive a refund or discount !!!!
negative	disgusting service .
negative	very unhappy customer :(
negative	had great prices but i see why , the customer_service and timing is terrible .
negative	what almost two_weeks to receive a part only to finally get a email_stating that the part was out of stock after saying on the web_site that it was in stock .
negative	i will never use them again
negative	agent was very rude when i was try to rebook a flight that the airlines cancelled .
negative	never buy the insurance ---- worthless !!!!!
negative	!
negative	when i received my rug , it had dirty spots all over it and no invoice to send it back !
negative	!
negative	yo puse la pagina para para reservar y pagar on usa dollares de estados unidos y agarre mi confirmation con otro diferente signo seguido de_la cantidad de cobro , y ahora no tengo ni idea cuanto me van a costar los ticketes y no puedo oencontrar un numero de telefono para hablar con alguien k me pueda ayudar .. serian tan amables de comunicarse conmigo por favor lo mas pronto posible ???
negative	mi numero de telefono esta en la reservacion ....
negative	i am in no way happy with this company and will not be ordering from them in the future .
negative	they are quick to charge you for the product but extremely slow to deliver .
negative	it has_been 0_weeks since i have placed my order and still have not received it .
negative	no one answers the phone or returns calls .
negative	save_yourself the stress and go elsewhere
negative	i was very disappointed in the service of printer_inks recently .
negative	previously they have been great , but last time i ordered a printer cartridge i also got a bill for £_000 of goods i didn_'_t order .
negative	i also ordered generic cartridges for my printer that didn_'_t work and wasn_'_t warned of that being a possibiltiy .
negative	i have asked for advice and have returned them for a refund , but in order to make my printer work , had to order an original cartridge .
negative	i was told that they would send this by the quickest possible means but was not told that this would cost me extra in postage .
negative	i have been offered no compensation for the cost of phoning printerinks premium_rate number although i have asked for this .
negative	nor have i had any satisfaction or reply from the customer e_- mail complaints service .
negative	i intend to find another cartridge provider .
negative	what a shame !
negative	signed_up for auto delivery on first order .
negative	was so excited about the program .
negative	my first order qualified for 0 - day shipping and i was confident that my 0 day supply would last .
negative	however , my shipping changed to 00 day with cavalear attitudes and nonchalant approach to my issue .
negative	nothing on website says " you may get 0 - day shipping " or " free 0 - day shipping when possible "!
negative	i was left to scramble to find my food locally and can '_t cancel this order unless i '_m home the very moment it arrives and refuse delivery !
negative	if i had that kind of time i wouldn_'_t be attracted to this type of service .
negative	sorry , but it '_s never good to over promise and under deliver .
negative	i use a number of delivery sites ranging_from seamless web , to eat00 , freshdirect , etc .
negative	delivery . com has by_far the worst customer_service .
negative	they never resolve the issue at hand .
negative	the response time to very slow .
negative	i have come to them multiple_times now with the same issue regarding a coupon that should technically qualify at a specific restaurant but does not .
negative	as nobody answers me i eventually apply it , reluctantly , elsewhere .
negative	they then point me to the fact that i used it .
negative	great .... really great .
negative	however you seem to be missing the point that i only used it elsewhere because the place i wanted to use it at didn_'_t work on numerous_occasions .
negative	also , if you inquire as to a slow / late delivery no actions is actually taken with the restaurant .
negative	not pleased ,. did not receive what expected .
negative	i appreciated your very prompt service when i ordered recently .
negative	items arrived quickly and in good condition .
negative	i do not do facebook so i wonder_if you extend this offer and don_'_t try to foist fb on potential_clients .
negative	thank_you .
negative	i love the products and the price , however , when my items were lost in transit customer_service was very poor .
negative	they were rude and sarcastic and not just one customer_service agent .
negative	i made several_attempts to resolve the issue and was treated the same every time !!
negative	after the first correspondance they closed my case even_though it was unresolved .
negative	their suggestion ?
negative	check with my apartment manager , case closed !
negative	what ??
negative	no thanks i wont purchase there again because they do not guarantee delivery of your items and if it gets lost in transit then your out the money you spent on items you will never get .
negative	poor poor poor customer_service !
negative	i purchased an item on oct . 00th .
negative	my credit was approved .
negative	they never said they sent my item .
negative	i emailed them a couple days ago to find out if they have mailed it .
negative	i have an order number which i included .
negative	i bought it as a gift for a grandson and plan to drive out of town to his_birthday_party in two_days .
negative	i get no response from them .
negative	i have wasted 00_hours of my life that i can '_t get back waiting in for a courier who never arrived .
negative	the live_chat was a waste of time , the girl was obviously used to refunding people .
negative	as if i was going to rebook for tomorrow and waste another 00_hours of my life .
negative	stay away from this company they are useless .
negative	j ’_ai passé ma_commande le 00 mars et presqu ’ un mois plus tard je_n ’_ai toujours pas reçu mes lunettes de soleil .
negative	easylunettes a répondu à mon premier e_- mail , mais pas le deuxième ni le troisième .
negative	easylunettes m ’ a dit il_y a deux semaines que « nous estimons qu ’ il faudra 0 à 00 jours supplémentaires pour que votre produit nous arrive .
negative	» et « soyez assurée que nous continuons d ’ insister quotidiennement auprès de nos fournisseurs afin qu ’ ils nous livrent votre modèle .

negative	i ordered a coat or my partner which had to be returned for a smaller_size i found them extremely_rude ad it has taken rather a while for them to receive it when i rang to ask someone she was extremely_rude but it was diffent when i was spending money !
negative	tried ordering .
negative	calles back and pushes on me accessoried .
negative	cancellec immideately .
negative	after a month my order hadn_'_t come .
negative	i inquired , they sent an_email a few_days_later saying everything was on back order and was going to be at_least 0 more weeks .
negative	they said i could request a refund since everything was on back order , so i did .
negative	another month went by and another , they said it had to be processed a certain way then i would see it in my account after a couple statements .
negative	after filing a claim with my bank and printing all my emails from them , it took about 0 months to finally get my money .
negative	it was about $_000 . 00 .
negative	it was my bank that finially got them to refund my money .
negative	be careful , i will not order anything from my vitanet . com ever ..... no stars
negative	shockingly bad service .
negative	first of all wrong_size trainer sent .
negative	then i was told on the phone they did not have the size i wanted ( did they know this first ?
negative	), even_though it said online they did .
negative	rudeness experienced from customer_service .
negative	i emailed to see if they did have right size , they emailed back it was not .
negative	i decided to order online to see if it would come_back as available as so much wrong information was given i wouldnt be surprised if they got this wrong too .
negative	the goods arrived in the right size - no confirmation_email , or tracking_number .
negative	i sent an_email to customer_service to tell the tale and they sent an_email to say that they would respond - have heard_nothing !
negative	very poor .
negative	i ordered ink ( black and colored ) for my hp_printer and called to inform customer_service that i had received the wrong number .
negative	without calling me , another package arrived in the mail .
negative	this time , it contained the correct cartridges .
negative	however , when i installed them and began printing , these , too were faulty .
negative	i had to remove them from the printer , shake them several_times and reinstall them to get them to print only a couple of pages .
negative	i have had to repeat this several_times ( whenever i want to print something )!
negative	!
negative	i have not called back , because i do not want more ink -- i want my money back !
negative	!
negative	first time buying from this site and completely regret it !!!
negative	the only_thing i didn_'_t have a problem with was the shipping because i actually received the product before the estimated shipping date .
negative	but , of course the actual product was horrible !
negative	0 .
negative	site description of the material was completely off !
negative	0 .
negative	picture on the site was also different from the actual item .
negative	0 .
negative	buttons were not even sowed on .. they were tied on -.-
negative	i booked a room at cleveland clinic to take my mother to a heart specialist .
negative	the date of our appointment changed and i called expedia to modify my reservation .
negative	the representative who answered spoke little english and i have to believe the call was routed overseas .
negative	i was told that the computers were down and that i would have to call back .
negative	over a two day period , i called nine times and was told each time that i would have to call back .
negative	i explained that i was trying to modify the reservation by six o ' clock and was advised that there would be no problem .
negative	when i finally was able to get though the next_day , i was advised that i would be charged for that night and for a block of four nights even_though we were only staying for two .
negative	i will never consider_using this company again .
negative	i paid for one month and do feel that i should have to pay until i get my cards .
negative	awful ..
negative	i have tried to call and have not received anything still
negative	thanks alot !!
negative	!
negative	i was relieved to learn that partsgeek had my difficult to find part .
negative	i placed my order online and the funds were extracted from my account the following_day .
negative	five days_later i received an_email indicating that i was being credited for the part .
negative	there was no notification explaining why or what happened .
negative	i tried_calling customer_service numerous_times , only to be put on hold for hours at a time .
negative	i finally stopped calling 0 days_later when the funds were back into my account .
negative	i still have no_idea why the order was cancelled .
negative	this process cost me 0 days delay in getting my car repaired .
negative	over all a very disappointing experience .
negative	my advice is do not order a part from this company unless it is not urgent .
negative	i uploaded 00 files and after 0 days still had not received all of them .
negative	they were only 00_minutes long .
negative	i should have received them after 0 days .
negative	i called support and they were sent right_away .
negative	but still late .
negative	apparently everything i ordered was no_longer available but no one let_me know until i inquired_about why it had not arrived .
negative	very poor customer_service .
negative	i was very excited to finally find a frame i liked that was reasonably_priced so i ordered from selectspecs right_away once i made my decision .
negative	that was 0 / 00 / 00 .
negative	they shipped out in a reasonable time but now have sat in the sorting_office of usps for 0_weeks .
negative	selectspecs will not inquire with usps to find the source of the delay .
negative	and i have been told that i will get them " sooner or later ".
negative	when i asked what would happen when i didn_'_t receive then they said that they would remake them after 00 days and then ship them out again .
negative	with the same shipping service that lost them in the first place .
negative	unless i want to pay more for them to ship fedex or dhl .
negative	no , i am not responsible for the package being lost , i will not pay for the shipping that is guaranteed .
negative	these are prescription_glasses .
negative	these are a different prescription than i have had before because my vision is worse .
negative	not having the new prescription is costing me work .
negative	and again they will not even make a postal inquiry .
negative	i '_m now at the point of dispute for non delivery of goods as my only recourse .
negative	your order is still not recieved or refunded and this is from august_0000 . this is such poor form get your act_together and contact your customers !!!
negative	!
negative	poor show
negative	didn_'_t confirm delivery address when i paid through paypal clearly enough ,
negative	tried to change address , took 0 days for them to come_back to me , in a week it still_hasn_'_t arrived and now my dad has no xmas_present as we leave tomorrow .
negative	thanks a lot gadget_grotto .
negative	i recently ordered several items from petflow online .
negative	it was the first time i have ordered from this company , but they were advertising an item called pet_corrector that i wanted to try to get my dog to stop_barking every time someone came to the door .
negative	then because they also advertised free_shipping for an order of $_00 or more , i ordered a couple of additional items that i thought i could use as well .
negative	when i went to click to confirm my order , the total reflected the discount for free_shipping , but then after i clicked confirm , the total indicated that i was being charged for the shipping .
negative	i tried to call the company and after being on hold for a long time , i then was told by a recording that they could not take my call at that time .
negative	so i contacted the company by email and received an_email response that told me that i did not receive the free_shipping because my order was not an auto_ship order !
negative	so i will not be ordering again from this company in the future .
negative	this site said they were la_quinta .
negative	we booked two rooms for one night .
negative	when we got to the hotel we learned that was not the case .
negative	when i received the receipt at the end of our stay and compared it to the charge on the credit_card i was shocked to find that i was charged an addition 00 . 00 above the price of the rooms for using this site .
negative	i will never use them again .
negative	i find the cost outrages .
negative	my story short .
negative	in the end of may 0000 we contact customer_service with uredanmark . com .
negative	i ask about delivery of a ferrari watch which our son was surpose to have for a pressent .
negative	a watch that i cannot purchase in denmark .
negative	customerservice asures me that they have the right watch in stock and that we have no reason to worry , because they have no reason to desive us .
negative	we transfer money by west union , after checking ofcourse that everything is in order .
negative	we then writte back to uredanmmark that we have transferd the monney .
negative	they reply that they will send the watch quickly .
negative	after getting the wrong track and trace number and waiting for serveral weeks we finely recieve the watch in the mittle of july .
negative	unfortunatly it is not the rigth watch but a cheap eiky watch with a stell wristband .
negative	i writte to customer_service again , who tells_me not to return the watch since it will be very expensive and if i will be kindly anough to send them a picture of the wrong watch .
negative	i do that and they return to me on mail an regret what has happend and to compensate the mistake they will give 00_% on my next purchase .
negative	i respond to them that it is not my mistake and that i am sorry , but i will not purchase from them again and that since it is theire mistake they should just send me the right watch without charge .
negative	this last mail i got no reply on .
negative	after having send the same e_- mail til uredanmark . com i promised to montion my experiences here on the website .
negative	i allso contacted them customer_service by using another e_- mail and ask if they had my watch in stock and how long it would take to deliver and how to compare it to the eiky watch witch was send to us by mistake .
negative	they where very positive until i wrote who i was .
negative	since my last conversation with uredanmark i have send my e_- mail to them allmost every day and i still_haven ´ t recieved an answer .
negative	i hope that from this story you will be aware not to purchase anything from this company .
negative	i think that uredanmark . com , ureudsalg . com are related so i expect that you will experience the same treatment from them as well .
negative	we purchased a chain saw and was told it would be delivered in the week commencing 00th may .
negative	it was actually delivered a week early which_meant by the time we were home to look at it the 0 days for a refund had already_passed .
negative	when we put the chainsaw together it was faulty so we contacted ukhs and were told someone would call us back , after 0 hours we called again and were told the same thing and after a further 0 hours we called again and were yet again told someone would call , no one did .
negative	on saturday we called again and was told someone would call us back and after 0 hours no one had ( yet again ) so we called again and was told the people we would need to speak to would probably have gone home so we should call back on monday .
negative	i then logged a dispute with paypal as i had purchased the item with paypal and on monday was called by a very rude man_who said he wanted to sort out the issue and had the cheek to say we should have called before setting_up a dispute on paypal and then accused us of lying about the previous calls because in his words " he can '_t see why the message wouldn_'_t have been passed on "
negative	the man was most unhelpful and told us we needed to send the item back or he wouldn_'_t do anything ( which we obviously would have done but paypal were now dealing_with the matter so we waited for them to tell us to do so )
negative	paypal favoured me in the dispute and finally gained my money back however the service from ukhs was extremely_rude and unhelpful , they are interested in selling and nothing else so if you do decide to purchase with them ( which i wouldn_'_t recommend ) then you will need to hope your items aren_'_t faulty as they definitely won_'_t assist you in returning the item .
negative	paypal policy leave big loop holes for scammers to take_advantage of .
negative	it lets paypal not take any responsibility whatsoever .
negative	even paypal claim it '_s safe , don_'_t worry we will take_care of your money .
negative	00_dollar down the drain , that '_s all , and paypal suck .
negative	i ordered 0 extra large ink_cartridges from inkfarm because i got tired of paying high prices for ink at walmart , so when i recieved my ink from ink_farm , i had to print off some flyers and the brand_new colored ink only printed off 00 copies ... and the regular cartridge i purchase from walmart will do 00 copies .... very very upset and dissapointed in my purchase from ink_farm ...
negative	i had a very bad_experience with them :
negative	i was moving houses and wanted to sort out the internet_connection etc .
negative	i called 000000 to find out the phone_number to sky .
negative	i wrote the number down however the advisor i talked to offered me to connect me with that number , which seemed a kind gesture , since she did not mention any charge for connecting me .
negative	guess what , i got charged £_00 for the conversation - it lasted about 00_mins to order the internet , tv and landline from skype .
negative	when i wrote a complaint to 000000 since i obviously would not ask them to connect me if they told me how much per_minute it would cost me , they said that i picked option 0 and i was informed by an_automated service about the costs which is a complete lie , since i talked with a person , who ' forgot ' to mention the price of the further connection .
negative	it took me about 0 further letters to get in the end only half of the money back - 000000 kept blaming my mobile network for these charges , while the mobile network was blaming 000000 .
negative	the company is based on dishonesty and hiding the facts from customers , in the hope that people do not check their phone bills .
negative	stay away from them for a mile or recommend to your enemies .
negative	my worst_experience ever !
negative	does anybody even speak_english in that company ?
negative	they are just taking p ** s of customers !
negative	i was moving houses , wanted them to transfer the phone line
negative	to my new flat .
negative	0 .
negative	the did not cut_off the line when they promised - it took them a week longer to do that .
negative	they were saying via mobile that it is not working , when i went over to check , it was still working .
negative	0 .
negative	i arranged an_appointment with their engineer to come over to my new flat on saturday since i am out of flat any other day of the week as i work in another town .
negative	they sent me a confirmation via_text_message that the engineer will be in my flat on saturday between_0am and 0pm .
negative	guess what , i got a phone_call from the engineer on tuesday about 0pm , that he is at the door and no one is in .
negative	when i told him that i did not have any appointments with him for tuesday but on saturday , he said they do not do saturdays and he would not tell me which company sent him , i was hoping it is someone for my flatmate maybe .
negative	i called talktalk three_times that week so that they can double and tripple check if everything is fine with the saturday appointment , and they said yes ( and were quite impatient as if i was taking their time to check an obvious thing ).
negative	guess what , i was waiting all day for the engineer on saurday , called talktalk again twice , once at 00am and once around 00 , only to get told that i need to wait patiently .
negative	when the engineer did not turn up at 0pm , i called them again , only to be informed that the engineer was there and i was not at home !
negative	when i think about this i am still so upset , they did not give me any apology for wasting my time and for that dreadful experience , they lied straight into my face , so disrespectful for me , as a customer , as a human_being !
negative	0 .
negative	after that i decided i do not want to have anything to do with them .
negative	but guess what , it is not that easy !
negative	because they basically pretend they do not understand_english , when you say you do not want to be their customer any more .
negative	they were passing me over one to another asking to wait , till the last person told me that it is impossible , otherwise they will charge me a disconnection fee .
negative	i laughed at them , how can they charge me a disconnection fee if i am not connected in the first place ?
negative	the last guy i spoke to was so afraid to remove me from the customers list , as if they threatened him with something if he does that .
negative	the conversation was like this :
negative	- please remove from the customers list
negative	- no problem , but ..
negative	- i do not want any buts , remove me please
negative	- yes , but ..
negative	- no buts , remove me from the customers list please !
negative	- but ...
negative	and so on about 00_mins !!
negative	!
negative	to put it short - this company is a disgrace and i am happy not to have anything to do with them any more .
negative	i ordered the jessops photobook for a special_occasion birthday .
negative	i was not impressed by the product i received from jessops , the photos were poor quality and odd colours .
negative	the jessops software used to create the book was slow and frustrating .
negative	overall i was not happy especially_considering the price and i will never use jessops again .
negative	i shopped with beautybay recently .
negative	after more than 0_weeks i still_haven_'_t received my package , and they said it takes 0 - 00 working days for us orders .
negative	i tried to contact them so many_times ... no responses ever .
negative	i filed a dispute with my credit_card and they refunded my money .
negative	will never ever shop with them again and will never recommend this site to anyone !
negative	extremely disappointed !
negative	this was my first time using bookbyte to order a used textbook and i am very frustrated with the company .
negative	i received a notice through my email for my order being placed and a order number , when my textbook never showed_up in the mail i checked the website .
negative	my order had been canceled due to the textbook being sold out .
negative	bookbyte never gave_me any notification of this cancellation of my order via_email .
negative	this is unacceptable and inexcusable behavior for a company who wishes to service college_students who need these books to guarantee success in class .
negative	on friday 0th it will be 0 full weeks since i '_ve been taking 0 pill 0 / 0 hr before my meals ( 0 ) per day .
negative	as per dr oz television show .
negative	he said to look for everything you show plus make_sure nothing else is added , ( which you also state ).
negative	i haven_'_t lost one lb yet .............. not one .
negative	i don_'_t snack between meals , my breakfast is oatmeal with blueberries / almonds in water , lunch is norm raw veggies / yogurt dip , and maybe 0 pieces of cheese .
negative	and i have a filling dinner , not always with a starch .
negative	the norm is meat and 0 veggies or 0 veg and a salad .
negative	i drink water , or i might have 0 - 0 glasses of wine every other day . thats it , no soda or beer ever .
negative	i '_ll continue with the pills untill gone just to see how i do , then if nothing , i '_ll try to find a different brand .
negative	if you have any suggestions , i ' d love to hear from you .
negative	i booked my flight with expedia only to find out that my contact after booking the flight would be through hotwire and than the billing on my back account was with a company called traverse .
negative	no where was there any information_regarding the connection between expedia , hotwire or traverse .
negative	my flight had to be cancelled due to bad_weather_conditions which i completely understand .
negative	we were traveling as a family from burlington , vermont to jfk in new_york to send my daughter off to study abroad .
negative	we changed our flight due to the weather and received a confirmation of new travel_plans .
negative	i than followed_up with the air line as i viewed on line that the flight they put us on had been cancelled .
negative	over the next 0 hours " not joking " in the time_frame i remained on the phone line with a representative from hotwire to re - book a flight .
negative	to make it easier we decided to just have my daughter and i travel as we knew many people where looking for flights .
negative	it was sad not to have our whole family be able to send her off but we were trying to be respectful of mother nature and the challenges air lines have when bad_weather occurs .
negative	finally , the representative told me we could get a flight out for my daughter and i and put me on hold to arrange the confirmation .
negative	literally , in a three time_frame she got back on the line with me and told me there was only one seat available .
negative	i explained how could this be as she just told me she was going to make the final confirmation .
negative	furthermore , i gave up two seats to help the airline out only to have another seat taken_away .
negative	so alas , i continue to await four hours_later on the phone for flight .
negative	at this point it looks like we will cancel it all and drive .
negative	never , never , never use expedia .
negative	there company has to many affiliates which makes simple changes and communication basically impossible .
negative	very saddened and disappointed in their customer_service .
negative	it has taken three attempts to finally receive a duvet_cover that is not faulty !
negative	first order had a hole in it and the second a grease stain .
negative	although the helpline staff did apologise , they certainly did not put them selves out to offer an explanation even when i posted a complaint through care @ bedeck - i am still_waiting for a response a month later .
negative	bedeck do not offer a pre_- paid returns service for faulty goods and therefore postage_costs have to be paid up front by the customer and at £_00 x 0 this is a little annoying especially when i had to further chase the second postage_costs to be refunded .
negative	sorry bedeck i don_'_t rate your quality control nor your customer_service and would not recommend your company to anyone !
negative	i still have not recived my items as fedex delivered them to an unknown house 0 doors away and they are never home ... i am very unhappy
negative	i bought the one part black version for $_00 and had a really tough time getting it to not bubble .
negative	i build furniture so i am not new to paint , sealer , etc .
negative	but i couldn_'_t get this to work .
negative	i did not shake the can ; i stirred slowly for 00_minutes .
negative	after using the entire can without_success , i decided it must be user error and i ordered another can .
negative	i spoke to them on the phone to verify humidity and the type of roller i should use .
negative	i bought something to show the humidity in the room i was working in , and the conditions were good but i still got bubbles using their suggested roller .
negative	finally with the last of the second can , i poured it on a flat surface and slowly swirled it around so there would be no way that i was introducing the bubbles .
negative	minutes later , there were huge bubbles everywhere that never popped .
negative	i call them again , and they asked me to send photos which i did .
negative	i never_heard from them , and i wish i could get my $_000 back - it is a complete_waste of money .
negative	i placed a order for flowers and chocolates for a friend in hospital , however when i asked my friend about the delivery i found out it never arrived .
negative	i contacted iflorist first via_email and then live_chat , as no phone numbers , who confirmed order had not been sent .
negative	i asked why not sent and why did they not inform me .
negative	said problem with florist and didn_'_t answer on why did not inform me .
negative	it was agreed that the order would be resent to my friend , now at home , but order would be upgraded .
negative	so a week after original delivery date a order did arrive , but not with the chocolates as i had ordered .
negative	i have emailed iflorist about this , wrote on their facebook_page , but have has no response !
negative	very upset over my treatment from this company and their not only lack of customer_service but how they can get a order wrong twice and still not respond about this .
negative	would not ever take the risk again of using this company .
negative	first of all only 0 / 0 items that i ordered arrived ...... late at that .
negative	took a month to arrive .
negative	the rings came broken , i emailed them and to this day no response .
negative	don_'_t order from them .
negative	update 00 / 00 / 0000 .
negative	after leaving my review the owner of the store messaged me on trustpilot .
negative	questioning my authenticity of my review .
negative	after that i finally got responses in my inbox .
negative	their ' reasoning ' of not replying is because there was a " week long holiday " in their country .
negative	this was the 0th of october and we ' re almost reaching november and oh what a surprise .
negative	still no products .
negative	and another thing .
negative	don_'_t trust all these reviews ladies and gents .
negative	the ones that end with a silly plug of ' oh use my code for 00_%_off ' aren_'_t authentic in the least bit .
negative	they just want some money off on their next order .
negative	we gotta look out for each other .
negative	absolutely horrible customer_service .
negative	with products that are not worth it .
negative	i had originally wrote a 0_star response .
negative	because i cannot edit it , i '_m writing a 0nd review .
negative	i had said that i loved that they honored their competitors website prices .
negative	well this morning i got an_email_saying that the website i had used was not a competitors site because they had a processing_fee .
negative	i checked and the fee was only $ 0 .
negative	i saw nothing about any processing fees , only if you find it cheaper they will honor that price .
negative	i have responded to sw letting them know to cancel my order and i '_ll take my business elsewhere .
negative	sent a parcel via this company through p0d .
negative	the pick_up time was great and everything looked like it went well .
negative	until the parcel was received by my friend .
negative	they say they use ' machines ' so make_sure you parcel is strong and secure which i did .
negative	the box had a big rip in and most of the items i sent which were secure were smashed to pieces !
negative	also i wasn_'_t impressed with the tracking service which suggested my parcel had been sat in a van for hours .
negative	not really what i ' d expect from £_00 + secure postage !
negative	finally got my money back because of p0d but this took 0 months because the wouldn_'_t reply to emails or send forms back !
negative	the only_thing that was good was the time it took to deliver the item ... but when it '_s been smashed to pieces that '_s not much to rave about
negative	rentalcars . com are misleading and misrepresent the full cost of the car_hire abroad .
negative	£_000 was taken from our credit_card for damage excess refund in italy which we had already paid for in the uk .
negative	they say their mission is to make properly feeding your pet less_than a chore ... big fail !!!
negative	just a couple days ago , i wasted an entire hour of my morning trying to straighten_out their billing error !
negative	whatever you do , don_'_t give them your credit_card number !!!
negative	they will charge whatever they please to your credit_card , and when you call them to correct it , they will give you the royal runaround !!
negative	their customer_service dept .
negative	sucks !!
negative	i will never buy from them again and i tell all my friends to save themselves the headache !!
negative	!
negative	i will never use travelocity or united_airlines again !
negative	if i were stranded on a deserted island and a united plane flew overhead , i would quickly stomp out my firey help sign and wait for another airlines to rescue me !
negative	i almost missed my mother '_s funeral , then had to wear my dirty sweatpants i ' d been traveling in all day to the funeral because after united cancelled my flight at the last_minute and had no additional flights until the next_day after the funeral , they refused to give me my luggage that was downstairs so i could hitch a ride from total strangers who were also stranded by united .
negative	i had to travel onward to my destination with the strangers and one of their husbands who drove 0 hours to get us !
negative	then united sent my bag to my destination after i had left for my returning flight !
negative	i got a refund from united for the portion of my trip and a silly $_00 voucher to travel on their awful airline again which i will never use .
negative	i informed travelocity of this terrible situation and they said there was nothing they could do , including working things out with united to get the small refund i received .
negative	i even had to do that myself .
negative	travelocity is a lazy company and if you have a problem you will have to solve it yourself !
negative	i received my new sunglasses without a prescription .
negative	i then returned them with a copy of my rx .
negative	it has_been over a month and have received nothing .
negative	i keep emailing them but get nothing but an acknowledgement of my email .
negative	i will never deal with them again .
negative	ho_ordinato due capi il_giorno 00 agosto 0000 , pagati subito con carta di credito .
negative	dopo settimane in cui non_ho più saputo nulla sul mio ordine ho scritto al customer_service che_mi_ha assicurato che sarebbe stato fatto un controllo nel magazzino .
negative	dopo aver inviato alcune altre mail ( cui non sempre è stata data risposta ), finalmente mi viene confermato l ' invio della merce .
negative	aspetta e aspetta ... il_giorno 0 ottobre finalmente arriva un pacco contenente uno solo dei capi ordinati e una lettera che assicurava l ' arrivo dell ' altro nel giro di 0 - 0 giorni .
negative	oggi è il 00 ottobre e dell ' altro oggetto neanche l ' ombra !!!
negative	!
negative	l ' oggetto mancante era il regalo per_il compleanno di mio marito ( 00 settembre ) che avevo ordinato ben un mese prima della data ...... mi è stato promesso un dono per risarcirmi del disagio , ma anche quello sarà nel prossimo pacco ... sempre ammesso che arrivi !
negative	!
negative	gentile staff ,
negative	ho appena letto la vostra risposta e vi ringrazio per l ' attenzione prestata a quanto da me scritto .
negative	comprendo le difficoltà in cui incorre chi deve organizzare un lavoro complesso come il vostro , difficoltà di cui non avete mai fatto cenno nelle mail che_mi avete inviato .
negative	a proposito della lettera presente nel pacco e riguardante il capo mancante , devo far presente che_non avete richiesto alcun contatto da parte mia per organizzare la nuova spedizione ( ed è questo il motivo per cui non vi ho più contattati !)
negative	.
negative	la dicitura presente è la seguente " egr .
negative	cliente , la presente per informarla che l ' articolo mancante è in fase di spedizione da un altro nostro punto logistico e pertanto lo riceverà a breve ( 0 - 0 giorni ) in un pacco successivo .
negative	per eventuali informazioni rivolgersi a info @ fashionqueen . net " ( cosa che avevo già fatto più volte e che_non_ho ritenuto dover ripetere ).
negative	ringrazio ancora per l ' attenzione e spero che con il prossimo acquisto tutto funzioni alla perfezione !
negative	i contacted the toll_free number to book a room at the country inn and suites in clarksville , tn .
negative	the hotel was booked so the gentleman i spoke to told me he could book me in the same type of room at the candlewood inn and suites .
negative	when we got the hotel ( after driving for 00hrs with an 00yr_old and 00 month old ) i was informed that i was booked in a queen suite not a king suite and none of the rooms had the sofa_sleeper i had requested .
negative	after about 00_mins of trying to get everything straightened_out my family and i ended_up going down the road and staying at another hotel chain .
negative	i was very disappointed in all the miscommunication .
negative	the only_thing that was done right was my money being refunded back to my charge card .
negative	this was the worst_experience i '_ve ever had .
negative	i '_ve worked in the customer_service industry for over 00 years , these so called agents lack the skills and ideology to assist customers .
negative	never will i book through this sight again .
negative	paid $_00 for an overnight delivery and it wasn_'_t even shipped until a week_later completely missing my daugter '_s birthday !
negative	i usually go through hotwire .
negative	however , this time i thought i ' d try priceline because hotwire didn_'_t have the hotel i was looking for .
negative	the hotel was exactly as i expected , so that wasn_'_t an_issue at all .
negative	the issue was with customer_service .
negative	i called to ask if i could make_sure the room had two beds .
negative	long_story short , he told me the hotel would cancel it with a full_refund after_speaking to them with me on hold .
negative	he straight lied to me .
negative	i called the hotel_directly after the call with priceline and she told me that she never said anything like that .
negative	she added that she couldn_'_t do anything with the reservation and only priceline can change / cancel a reservation .
negative	she ended_up personally upgrading my room after all the issues with priceline .
negative	i decided then to stick to hotwire .
negative	after the trip , i called to complain_about the previous guy .
negative	i didn_'_t want to before it because i was concerned they ' d retaliate with an extra_charge or something .
negative	they seemed that low to me .
negative	the lady quickly listened to a little of what i had to say and then said " if that '_s all you have to say , goodbye ."
negative	she hung_up on me !!
negative	never again !!
negative	it confirmed that i am a loyal hotwire customer .
negative	had major issues with obtaining my rewards and i never received a refund on a damaged return .
negative	hurtig_levering , men manglende tydelighed rent prismæssigt .
negative	fx .
negative	fremgår det_ikke at der bliver tillagt et højt portogebyr i forhold til_den faktiske pris .
negative	desuden er bonruller meget mindre end ved andre leverandører .
negative	ordered goods and requested a change , they told me the goods have been dispatched already so i should re - order and simply refused the delivery for my first order .
negative	paid_extra for quicker delivery but it never turned , then all the goods from both orders turned_up together and the builder didn_'_t know what to return .
negative	" better " bathrooms then told me it was my fault and i have to pay for returning the products , absolutely disgraceful !
negative	!
negative	simply ... i ordered some flowers to be delivered on wednesday 00th - they didn_'_t arrive - i heard_nothing - i asked for them to be redelivered that week ..
negative	apparently you couldn_'_t ...
negative	they ended_up being delivered yesterday ( 00nd )- a tiny tiny bunch for £_00 .
negative	0 days late .
negative	completely missing the occasion they were intended for .
negative	utter rubbish .
negative	the african american male at the counter , began talking with an african american woman_who came in after me … she was going on and on about a $_00 .
negative	unit , it was obvious it would be an extended conversation so i went outside to my car to return calls while i waited for him to finish up with her .
negative	she finally walked out about 00_minutes later ( he knew i was waiting to rent a unit as i had already agreed to rent it - a $_000 . 00 unit )… when i went back to the office , the " closed " sign displayed and door locked .
negative	i banged and waited and about 00_minutes later i could see the man and young_woman ' strolling ' back …. obviously , his paycheck does not depend_on the profitability of this company .
negative	i was excited about booking with autoeurope because it seemed easy and quite reasonably_priced .
negative	unfortunately , when we picked_up the car at enterprise in scotland , we found out that there were a number of fees that were not included in the additional pricing .
negative	we knew there would be a few more charges , but it more than doubled the cost , which was quite a bit more than_anticipated .
negative	it was not an accurate way to price compare in advance , given that the amount of all of the charges was not disclosed .
negative	next time i would book directly with the carrier and bypass autoeurope .
negative	the book was very worn , not really useable and written all in .
negative	i knew the book was used but didn_'_t expect it to be so bad for the amount i payed .
negative	i did return it to receive my money back and have yet to get it back .
negative	not sure if i '_ll will use site again .
negative	i paid for the flowers (£ 00 ) on a friday_morning with extra for sameday delivery .
negative	on saturday_morning i received an_email_saying that the flowers had been delivered ( they had not ).
negative	it '_s now monday and the flowers still_haven_'_t arrived .
negative	on saturday i submitted a query to the email_enquiries to determine the whereabouts of the flowers .
negative	no response .
negative	no phone_number to call to progress the enquiry .
negative	in summary - paid money for nothing .
negative	not sure if i '_ve been conned or if it '_s just appalling service .
negative	either way , will never bother again .
negative	the package was not delivered to our address .
negative	it was delivered 00_miles down the road ( 00_miles round_trip for us to pick it up ).
negative	fedex is very bad about delivering to many people on this paved two lane road .
negative	the road services 00 families .
negative	we want you to send us another package or we are going to stop payment with our credit_card company for this undelivered package .
negative	it was the worst_experience i have ever had , i regularly hire cars all over europe for business purposes but it was the first time i had booked with you , and will certianly be the last !
negative	i booked a opel corsa to pick_up at bradford airport on the 00 / 00 and drop_off at_gatwick airport 00 / 00 but when i arrived at the hertz desk at bradford i was told there were no cars available and i should make a new request at another desk , with not onlyand enormous price difference but a loss of almost 0hour and 00mins .
negative	but what made it worse was that nobody had mailed or text me to advise of such a problem so the supervisor of hertz decided to " invent " the excuse of his email not working .
negative	so i luckily managed to get a car from avis and do the business i had to do .
negative	but believe me i was totally shocked to go to to pick_up my avis car and to turn to see that the hertz dock had 0 cars including an opel corsa , which i took a photo of parked in dock 00 .
negative	so i returned to the hertz desk and told the supervisor that i thought it was rather strange to see so many parked in their dock .
negative	he first feebly made the excuse that they were not their cars but another companies !!
negative	but when 0 men arrived to request a car , which he consulted his computer - amazingly now working !!!
negative	he found a car for them .
negative	he then tried to make up new excuses about the cars being finally hertz cars but had been previously booked months ahead , i told him i was not informed that it was hertz policy to guarantee cars only months ahead .
negative	i now look_forward to receiviong a prompt refund and will take up this legally as i consider it to be very serious that you have accepted a booking and accepted the payment but then invent excuses when the customer arrives at the collection_point .
negative	i note i have previosuly and even now accepted your terms & conditions but maybe we coustomers should write up some for you !!!!
negative	!
negative	a very disappointed and angry ex customer
negative	marie ann morrison
negative	i tried to cancel the order but i had to send a email and wait for them to read it supposedly in 00 to 00_hrs .
negative	i received the order before i received an answer to my email , ten days after i placed the order and canceled it .
negative	i order on the web every day and i don_'_t ever have this kind of service .
negative	never again .
negative	i thought that i was talking to a marriot reservation clerk .
negative	i told him that i was reserving the fairfield because of their indoor_pool .
negative	well i arrived at the hotel in fairmont , wv .
negative	; the pool would be shut_down for 0 month for maintance .
negative	next , i tried to contact the epexida number and they transfer me to another expedia number and i was cut_off because i could not answer the digital answering system fast enough .
negative	for now on i will contact hotel_directly .
negative	i really deserve a refund or credit from this company .
negative	the several faxes / e_- mails i '_ve sent to expedia since yesterday :
negative	yesterday i tried to book a trip chicago with my visa_debit_card .
negative	in canada , it is a debit bank card that allows us to make online purchases .
negative	at the end of my booking , i was informed that the order would not be processed and i assumed it was because it was a debit visa , not a credit_card visa .
negative	an_hour later , i noticed on my online_banking that expedia had withdrawn $_000 . 00 from my bank_account .
negative	i was on the phone last night several_times and spoke to several people .
negative	i was on hold for a total of 00_minutes .
negative	no one would listen to me and kept insisting it was just a credit_card authorization .
negative	it was not .
negative	your company physically removed that money from my bank_account which i absolutely did not authorize you to do .
negative	your customer_service reps are rude , spoke over me and yes , i was angry , however , putting me on hold and not coming_back is unacceptable .
negative	if one of them would have just listened to what i said , i may have been more successful in explaining my issue .
negative	the " authorization " does not need to be " dropped ", i require a refund back into my bank_account of the money , and i want that money returned immediately .
negative	this is the worst_experience i have ever had booking a trip .
negative	do not use this company !!
negative	i have no trip and they have $_000 . 00 of my money !
negative	i pay $_00 dollars a month & yet my credit_report is almost $ months behind !!!
negative	why should i pay a monthly fee if the site doesn_'_t update !!!
negative	!
negative	i am very disappointed with my recent experience with priceline and won_'_t be using them again .
negative	i made a reservation for 0 nights .
negative	i was required to prepay but , the reservation could be cancelled by 00noon the day before arrival .
negative	i needed to cancel the last night of the reservation and called in the afternoon the day before arrival - i was not able to cancel the last night and could no_longer could cancel the whole reservation without_penalty .
negative	i didn_'_t see any information that said i could not change this reservation - i thought since i could cancel the day before , that would certainly allow 00 + hours notice to cancel the last night - not so .
negative	i also was not a good consumer with the purchase at all .
negative	the price was only $ 0 . 00 cheaper per_night than the rate offered directly by the hotel with my aaa_discount .
negative	lesson_learned again : shop around - compare prices - ask about everything in advance before giving out that credit_card number .
negative	i have never been treated so poorly in my life by customer_service reps !
negative	they are completely outrageous !
negative	i tried to book 0 roundtrip tickets and a car_rental .
negative	the website kept telling_me it couldn_'_t book it , so i needed to call the customer_service line .
negative	after_spending 0 hours on hold , i finally got through to someone .
negative	my package deal was $ 0 , 000 when i was booking online .
negative	by the time i got through to the lady , it had gone up to $ 0 , 000 .
negative	she told me that they couldn_'_t honor the price on my screen since i hadn_'_t booked before it went up .
negative	the only_reason i hadn_'_t booked was because the website was glitching and wouldn_'_t let_me .
negative	after her going back and forth with me for 00_minutes about how she couldn_'_t honor the price , i asked for a manager .
negative	she kept telling_me that i couldn_'_t talk to one until i insisted about 0 times .
negative	finally she said i still couldn_'_t talk to one but that she would honor the price .
negative	she was going through the booking process of getting me on the flights and told me she was going to put me on hold .
negative	after 00_minutes of being on hold , i was transferred to another person completely !
negative	that person said they couldn_'_t transfer me back to the original person and i had to re - explain my situation with them .
negative	they refused to honor the price and this time the flight had gone up another $_00 !
negative	by this point i had been on the phone for 0 hours and 00_minutes .
negative	i eventually agreed to pay the higher price , so we were going through the book process and then the lady told me that none of my flights worked together .
negative	and i asked her to explain , and she said that i just needed to pick new flights completely !
negative	she said i wouldn_'_t be able to make any of the planes between my layovers .
negative	my layovers were between 0 - 0 hours and they were in small airports .
negative	it would not have been a problem .
negative	i '_ve flown several_hundred times and have rarely had problems with making connecting_flights .
negative	so i told them that they had horrible customer_service and that i would go somewhere_else .
negative	completely ridiculous .
negative	not helpful at all !
negative	oh !
negative	and they charged my credit_card 00 times !
negative	do not use them .
negative	it '_s not worth it .
negative	one day after giving you my mobile number i received a spam / scam text_message from a uk number .
negative	i have reason to believe you onsold my number and i will be very wary of using your service again .
negative	the book i rented isnt even consider a book its just a bunch a papers held together with a rubber band .
negative	gave_me a smoking_room . could not take a shower it would not turn on . very upset with the stay
negative	i ordered 0 items on 0 / 00 / 00 .
negative	there was no_indication that the items were out - of - stock .
negative	i received a confirmation_email indicating my order would be shipped in 0 - 0 business days .
negative	today i check my order status and the page indicated my order had been cancelled .
negative	i was never notified and am now out of the products i ordered and in dire need of them .
negative	it is unbelievable that i can order something , receive a confirmation and the order be cancelled and never notify me .
negative	since signing_up and paying the premium price i cannot see my scores or my credit_report .
negative	how about a refund and ill move on .
negative	see above statement
negative	ive booked a number of hotels with agoda .
negative	when it works well - in other words , no need for trouble shooting or customer_service - its a good deal .
negative	when it does not work well - when there is problem that requires support - it is awful .
negative	one problem i had recently is i booked a hotel in europe .
negative	it was unclear from my confirmation_email that , in fact , the booking went through booking . com and that i should contact booking . com for troubleshooting support .
negative	it was also unclear in the confirmation_email that the payment would me made a the hotel .
negative	i was unable to get through to customer_service - apparently my agoda booking id had been erased in the system .
negative	i got through the system using another agoda booking id and then spent 00_minutes on the phone talking to customer_service sorting it out , and asking them to make some simple revisions to the confirmation_email so that , to customers , it was perfectly clear what implications of bookings passed to sister agencies would be .
negative	the response was lukewarm .
negative	another issue i had was checking into a hotel in south_africa and the hotel had to record of my paid reservation .
negative	they did not want to accept my voucher and proof of purchase .
negative	they said that the voucher did not state the amount paid for the room .
negative	that was very awkward .
negative	took too long to ship order , customer_service was rude , not helpful at all .
negative	not worth my time
negative	buy from heat and plumb if you want good prices , don_'_t buy if you want good customer_service .
negative	very ready to take your money but not to sort out problems .
negative	i have been trying to get a refund from them for 0 months for goods that were either not supplied or returned .
negative	my telephone_calls and emails are not returned .
negative	the last time i did manage to speak to somebody she told she had enough of her own problems and i wasn_'_t her only customer .
negative	i am not making this up .
negative	i would not recommend heat and plumb .
negative	it is now a week since i ordered and i live on the gold coast - not a tin pot town in the country .
negative	i still_haven_'_t received my order .
negative	granted , anzac day fell in the middle - but that still makes it over four days !
negative	order sofa covers that looked great on the web_site .... they turn out to be cheap pieces of cloth that just slid off my leather sofa .
negative	misleading and now i have to pay shipping cost to send back .
negative	will never order anything from this company again !
negative	cheap !!!!!
negative	!
negative	i paid for the card plus an extra processing_fee .
negative	the money was almost_immediately deducted from my debit_card .
negative	website said it was delivered .
negative	two_weeks_later it still isn_'_t .
negative	the tracking_number they provided was not a valid number , according to usps .
negative	i tried_calling customer_service but there was no option to speak to a person unless i wanted to place an order .
negative	i used " email contact " on website and received automated reply then , ten hours_later , i got this request to rate their services .
negative	i would be happy to amend this review if they resolve the issue .
negative	still no reply indicating they have any intention of addressing my complaint .
negative	i actually purchased the card for a family whose house burned down so it would have been nice if they could have had the card in a timely_manner .
negative	i spent some time talking with a couple of agents before making my reservation for a car with a pick_up in florence .
negative	i made it clear that my husband and i would be traveling with a bag each and although we were up for a small - ish car , we would need to transport ourselves and our_luggage for a week .
negative	i arranged for a 0 door car with room for bags .
negative	after taking the train from rome , walking through the streets of florence with our bags , and finally finding the avis station in florence , the agent told us that she only had smart cars available , that this was the class we had reserved , and that she could give us a much bigger car and only charge us for a car 0 classes larger .
negative	we had a bit of a language_barrier and i told her that there was no way we could fit both ourselves and our_luggage into such a small car and there was no way i would have reserved one .
negative	she reiterated that she would give us a deal on a larger car and that we had ordered the smart car .
negative	she had no other cars available and appeared frustrated with my inability to understand that i had ordered this tiny car .
negative	hot , tired , and bummed , i told her that i would call auto_europe to straighten it out .
negative	as i sat_down with my luggage in the somewhat busy waiting area and started to call , she " found " a volkswagen in the garage which she arranged for us to have at no extra_charge .
negative	because she was so nice .
negative	long_story short , although the car was fine and i ultimately got it at the agreed_upon price , i could have done without the drama .
negative	traveling can be a challenge , and i booked with auto_europe well ahead of time so i could avoid exactly this sort of hassle .
negative	i '_m guessing that most people just pay the extra_cost to avoid this sort of unpleasantness in the middle of their vacations , but that doesn_'_t make it good business_practice .
negative	tredmill delivered next_day delivery , paid for , for a christmas_present .
negative	the tredmill consequently wasn_'_t working , now unable to get a replacement for the next ten days .
negative	all we want is somekind of idea when this , what we though was a great christmas_present , will be replaced .
negative	wrong part was sent .
negative	can not get through on the phone - hangs_up on me when i press the right extension .
negative	trying to get return_label but the option is broken on the web_site .
negative	i hope it is fixed within 00 days so i can get my money back .
negative	too many little issues make me not want to use this company again .
negative	sorry too busy as have wasted enough time on this problem
negative	i was contacted by the flight_centre a couple of months_ago and was told that british airways had bumped me off my flight .
negative	i was moved to the next_day by flight_centre and change my return flight as well .
negative	i was led to believe that this was ba '_s fault and not the fault of the flight_centre and was assured that i was on the upgrade list and that hopefully i would get an upgrade on my flight .
negative	i happened to be talking to a friend of a friend who works for ba recently who informed me that be that they never bump people of flights until the actual day of the flight .
negative	this made me suspicious and i then did some digging and discovered that it was actually the flight_centre '_s fault .
negative	the flight_centre gave_me $_000 (£_000 ) to compensate me for the inconvenience and fact that i now have to get extra hotel accommodation .
negative	i am extremely disappointed that after having used flight_centre for a couple of years_now for all my many flights to florida , they could not be honest with me about their mistake .
negative	can you imagine how embarrassing it would have been if we turned_up on the day of our flight assuming it was ba '_s fault and asking for an upgrade ?
negative	!
negative	i don_'_t plan to use the flight_centre again any time soon !
negative	dont honor coupons that they put on facebook .
negative	the only place that sold that particular shoe , other then that would not shop with them .
negative	my new glasses i have had for not even a week and my right lens is now missing and do not know where it is it fell out last night , cant find it .
negative	i am verry disapointed
negative	tried to order the fre lifeproof case for an iphone 0 .
negative	i ordered this as a birthday_gift 0_weeks prior to when i needed it .
negative	was supposed to receive in 0 days but did not .
negative	credit_card was charged immediately .
negative	waited 00 days and contacted by website , they did not reply .
negative	called , no answer .
negative	0 . 0_weeks_later reached a live_person .
negative	said he needed to check if my credit_card had been charged ( i told him it had ) because it shouldn_'_t have been if the product was not sent .
negative	then said he had no internet service and would need to call me back !!
negative	what kind of " business " has no internet ?!
negative	of course , he did not call me back .
negative	called again , now 0_weeks after my credit_card was charged and still no product .
negative	he told me he would have to cancel the order !
negative	why ?!!
negative	the product is still available to purchase even today !!
negative	horrible
negative	waiting 00_minutes for pick_up at terminal is unacceptable .
negative	office personnel were rude and unhelpful .
negative	never again .
negative	this was my second time ordering probiotics from them .
negative	the first time i didn_'_t chose the refrigerated option because it was the middle of winter .
negative	this time i wanted to chose it but when i reordered it didn_'_t give me the option .
negative	so in the section where you can ask i question / leave a comment i asked if it would ship cold .
negative	no one responded to me so i called the next_day .
negative	i was told my order had already shipped and they probably just put an ice pack in it .
negative	i told them i wanted it refrigerated and asked to speak to a supervisor .
negative	i was told the supervisor was busy and just to ignore the package and return to sender .
negative	but then i was told that there would be a wait for another shipment because they were out of what i needed .
negative	the customer help was rude and i received horrible service .
negative	i highly_recommend shopping elsewhere .
negative	i was quoted $_00 . 00 by textbookrush . com to buy back my brand_new algebra textbook that i paid $_000 . 00 for .
negative	i verified the isbn_number from the book and the packing_slip from the company where i had purchased it from .
negative	i had dropped my online algebra class and couldn_'_t use it on campus .
negative	they have received this brand_new never used textbook and claim a different isbn_number was on the book and are only sending me a check for $_00 . 00 .
negative	thought their quote was too good to be true .
negative	what a bunch of crooks !
negative	beware when selling them your textbooks because from what i '_m reading this is a common_practice with them .
negative	scammers
negative	i have contacted metroswimshop twice_now about my order , which for two_weeks has shown in their system as " processed ."
negative	i just want to know when to expect my order , or if it '_s not coming at all !
negative	i have not heard back from them about my email requests and have not received any automatic notifications as to my status .
negative	will not be using them again .
negative	service is awful !!!
negative	!
negative	this service came up when i searched online for a specific hotel and the web address and 0 - 000 number led me to believe i was reserving at that hotel .
negative	not so !
negative	i arrived at the hotel to find out my reservation was invalid and that i had booked through a third_party service .
negative	fortunately booking directly at the hotel was cheaper but i still had to spend twenty_minutes trying to get the false reservation cancelled and my card refunded .
negative	due to a mix - up between superdry and the company in charge of delivering the item , i never received the item .
negative	the delivery company " attempted " delivery on numerous_occasions , and despite repeat attempts to provide very specific instructions on how to reach me , as well as my contact information , i was never contacted .
negative	the package was " attempted " to be delivered over the course of 00 days , and after days of communicating between superdry and dhl , i asked that the item be returned because i didn_'_t think i would ever receive the item .
negative	it has_been one week since superdry has confirmed my return , yet i have not received nor received any updates on my refund .
negative	horrible horrible service , will never attempt an online purchase again .
negative	0 meses e nada do meu produto chegar !!

negative	i am usually very happy with my boohoo products i have bought in the past .
negative	all have been great quality clothing an footwear , although my most_recent_purchase was a white maxi_dress i ordered for a christening i loved the look of the dress online so i orderd the dress and got next_day delivery so i would have it in time .
negative	when i received my order and tried it on i was disappointed as the material was completely see through .
negative	i sent the dress back explaining that it was not described as on website to my disguist i received a refund for the dress but still got charged for delivery .
negative	it has put me off buying from boohoo as i payed for delivery for an item i would not have ordered if i new it was see through and will not be buying online if this is the service i receive .
negative	total dissatified ...
negative	my large 0ft x0ft headboard was wedged into my open fronted porch , i did not know it was being delivered , it was hammering down with rain , so you can guess i was not amused , no delivery note , obviously did not sign for , luckily only .
negative	slight water mark at base .
negative	this was a very expensive hand made head board , and had i not come home when i did or was not able to move it ( which i did struggle with ) things would have been a lot worse .
negative	consignment no zdbdweooo000 .
negative	whilst the items i ordered are fab , the delivery was way below standard .
negative	i received a dispatch email_stating that i would be called within two_days to arrange a suitable day .
negative	i wasn_'_t contacted , the delivery just turned_up two_days_later .
negative	i wasn_'_t there to take delivery so they left it outside the front of the house .
negative	the email said i had twenty_minutes to check the items .
negative	i wasn_'_t given the chance .
negative	very poor service , particularly when delivery cost a fortune .
negative	dear petflow
negative	this review will not be a good review .
negative	my old cat , jack , was recently_diagnosed with kidney disease .
negative	the vet said he should eat prescription k / d cat_food .
negative	so i placed an order for two cases .
negative	jack hates the food and won_'_t eating .
negative	i called to return the unopened and untouched cat_food .
negative	pet_flow said : no returns .
negative	what ??
negative	this is a $_00 purchase .
negative	i should be been warned !
negative	very unhappy and will never use petflow again
negative	i have bought two tickets to the barcelona vs ac milan game in less_than two_weeks and still have not even received confirmation about the tickets being sent .!!
negative	as i will be travelling to spain i need these tickets before i leave this is a disgrace and with all the reviews i don_'_t know what is going on !
negative	my id is 0000000
negative	ck ' d around and i could have saved $_00 by booking on the hotels website .
negative	i booked a hotel and was told i could call any time to make chages to my reservation either upgrade room make_changes etc .
negative	i called to upgrade my room i was told by a different agent my reservation had restrictions and couldnt make any changes , i explained thats not what i was told at the time of me paying for the darn room .
negative	i will not be cooking here ever again this people are not professional they need to further train the agemts so they can provide their customer with correct information .
negative	order process slow
negative	we are still_waiting for our giants gear to be shipped .
negative	we thought we would be able to wear our gear during the world series .
negative	now that it hasn_'_t shipped as of 0 days after we ordered we are left disappointed .
negative	won_'_t be ordering from them again .
negative	in fact i think i want my money back ... i could have gotten shirts at walmart for a fraction of the price and could be wearing them now to cheer on our team .
negative	boo .
negative	worts customer_service ever
negative	i sold 0 mobiles to envirofone on 00 / 00 / 00 to the vaue of just over_£_00 .
negative	the envelope took 00 days to arrive .
negative	by the time the mobiles arrived to envirofone , i received an_email which showed the value had dropped to £_00 . 00 .
negative	i was not offered the mobiles returned as a result ( the value was worth more on mazuma at this point )..
negative	the cheque then still took over 0_weeks to arrive so took around 0 month from the start to end process .
negative	i have used mazuma twice in the past who are fantastic and the full process is sorted within 0 day .
negative	my mobiles are still worth more through mazuma than what i received from envirofone .
negative	i only used envirofone as their price at the beginning was more than mazuma , but i ended_up getting less in the end .
negative	very disappointed and will not use envirofone again !
negative	bought a dress , sent back waited ages for refund ... emailed - they told me they refund would be within the week , never recieved the money and actually forgot as i had just expected it to go in .... emailed again and eventually got the money put back in the following_day after email ...... just don_'_t forget about things as i easily do !

negative	not good
negative	i went online to book at a hampton_inn in oxford , ohio , and when i got my confirmation_email i realized i booked through a 0rd_party .... you .
negative	this was a surprise to me since i thought i was booking through hampton_inn .
negative	i was also then disappointed to see i had to cancel , if needed , 00_hours before my stay .
negative	that is not standard for a hotel booking .
negative	i am familiar with the standard of having until 0pm or later on the day of the stay , not 00_hours before .
negative	i will now be very much more aware of you and other 0rd parties butting into my booking experience .
negative	i have actually ordered from frames_direct about 0 times now , and this last time was definately my last , i am tired of being taken_advantage of , so i ordered , they messed_up my prescription on one of the eyes ( right ) she told me to send them back , they will correct and send it back to me 0nd day ups , they sent it back , regular mail , and i received it late , i was already out of the country by the time it got delivered , framesdirect just doesnt keep their word , and i am not spending a single dollar there anymore
negative	we booked a car_rental through priceline for a 0 - day trip to florida .
negative	pickup was in ft . lauderdale and drop_off in west palm_beach .
negative	our initial offer was refused , and we were not offered a car until we agreed to their lowest_price of $_00 / day plus tax , which brought our total to $_000 .
negative	shortly_after booking a non_- refundable car_rental through budget , we saw advertised on priceline '_s site , a rental base price of $_00 / day through alamo , the company we wanted in the first place .
negative	we called priceline and spoke to a staff_member and a supervisor , who basically told us " too bad " and would not change the booking or adjust the price .
negative	the ft . lauderdale budget car_rental desk was total chaos , a long line with almost an_hour '_s wait to get the car .
negative	the desk was understaffed , with 0 of their 00 computer stations not occupied .
negative	we were told by an employee that " it had been like that all week ", so this was not a fluke .
negative	under no circumstances should you rent from budget in ft . lauderdale !
negative	we were also told that they had the cheapest prices , hence the crowds , but this was not so as_described above .
negative	the car itself was fine , once we got it .
negative	the experience was unpleasant from the beginning .
negative	i was mislead and feel_like i was even being ' scammed '.
negative	i was online on what i thought was the comfort suites website and called your number thinking it was the comfortsuites reservation desk .
negative	i got a guy_who could_barely speak_english so it was hard to understand .
negative	i told him i was part of a group trying to make reservations for the lake george location .
negative	he convinced me to book it immediately because there were only 0 rooms left .
negative	we needed 0 rooms .
negative	so i booked it .
negative	i thought it was odd that he required full payment since i always pay just a deposit then pay the balance when we check in .
negative	but i gave my visa_card .
negative	when i got my email_confirmation i noticed he had booked me at the wrong hotel !!!
negative	wrong city !!!
negative	he booked me in saratoga springs instead of lake george !!!!
negative	how stupid can that be !!?!?!?!?!
negative	i called your customer_service immediately and told them what happened and want a credit .
negative	i was told that could not happen for 0 days .
negative	today is day 0 ........
negative	i want a credit on my account immediately .
negative	this is totally_unacceptable and i will now be very cautious about booking thru a reservation desk again ........
negative	very bad_experience and i '_m very angry ..............
negative	do not use .
negative	i bought two gift_cards the same day the people live 00_minutes from each other , one person got the gift_card before_xmas still_waiting on the other .
negative	the rep just rushed to get me off the phone .
negative	i placed an order for an unlock my iphone on november 0th .
negative	at the time , keys0iphone '_s site said my order would be completed in 0 - 0 days .
negative	on the fourth day ( november 00 ), i sent them an_email_asking for an update .
negative	there was no response .
negative	i had ordered the unlocking for an international trip the last_week of november -- and i ordered with this company based on the good reviews online , along with their presented window .
negative	unfortunately , my trip came and went without_any change in my order status .
negative	on december_00th , i sent another email .
negative	no response .
negative	about that time , i started checking out their facebook_page and noticed that i wasn_'_t the only person having problems .
negative	there were lots of posts asking for status_updates , complaining_about no contact , and requesting refunds .
negative	many of them were deleted within a few hours .
negative	on dec_00th , i sent keys0iphone a message on facebook and posted on their wall , asking if they had any type of update .
negative	my message was read , but not responded to .
negative	my wall post was deleted .
negative	i then followed_up with another email , which was never responded to .
negative	today , january third , i once again posted on their wall asking for an update , but i don_'_t anticipate i '_ll get any response .
negative	i see they are replying to some posters here , so maybe this will get me the customer_service response i '_ve been trying to get for almost two months .
negative	here '_s the thing : sometime in october , att borked the whole unlocking system by changing their protocol .
negative	i get that .
negative	i '_m totally understanding of that .
negative	in fact , because i knew that fact sometime around the end of november , i made sure to be extra understanding in my dealings with keys0iphone .
negative	given the situation , i didn_'_t expect an instantaneous unlock or anything -- in fact , i understood that there were delays beyond even their control .
negative	that '_s totally fine .
negative	what '_s not ok is not responding to repeated_requests for updates -- even if your update is just that you ' re not sure of a time_frame .
negative	six attempts at contact and literally no response .
negative	i will say that in monitoring their facebook_page , i noticed that they are deleting a lot of bad posts from unhappy_customers .
negative	in addition to that , they '_ve responded to a few people with an excessive amount of glib and snark ( just my opinion of course )-- basically telling them that if they are unhappy with waiting , they can get a refund , but they '_ll make_sure the phone will be stuck locked forever .
negative	i don_'_t get that last part , because if you haven_'_t even started an order , why would you do that ?
negative	threats and bullying in the face of customers just wanting * some * answer is not exactly good business_practice .
negative	i '_m sure this post is going to get me blacklisted , too , but i assure you that even now , i ' d be happy if they just apologized for the lack of communication and said we could move forward ( with better communication , of course ).
negative	i '_m sympathetic to them getting shafted by a phone company , but you '_ve got to keep in contact with your customers .
negative	if you need to go out and grab something for a night out on the town , this is your go to place , otherwise forget it .
negative	don_'_t expect anything from that store to last more than a few washings , or the first washing , if you ' re lucky .
negative	quality of their product is very very poor .
negative	make_sure to look over anything you ' re planning to buy very thoroughly , i '_ve bought a few things that have been defective , only to notice after tags were cut .
negative	the store is very cramped and crowded , it '_s hard to find anything .
negative	they ' re lucky not many people can_afford a quality product these days .
negative	expect to hand_wash everything if you don_'_t want it to completely be destroyed .
negative	even then you have to be careful with printed dyes and whatnot bleeding on the rest of the shirt .
negative	well if they read the orig .
negative	email that states all the info they needed to do this transaction instead f postponing the response i had to e_- mail them three_times each time took 00_hours to get a response right there just from them not being_able to read the first e_- mail that is 0 days there are only 0 days in a business week there fore over the weekend was added to it .
negative	needless to say i really wanted this company to work out for me but unfortunately you get what you pay for in this case manufacture defects .
negative	if i had received the item i had actually ordered , i might have something positive to write here !
negative	i thought this company has very bad customer_service .
negative	i accidentally hit the express shipping and contacted them by email and phone and they would not do anything to help me .
negative	no credit or nothing .
negative	i will not order from them ever again .
negative	i rented an apartment for six_months in copenhagen .
negative	during that time i was responsible for paying the energy bill for the apartment .
negative	dong sends a bill every three_months .
negative	i paid two energy bills and an ' overage ' charge of 000 dkk .
negative	i thought that the account was paid in full and i was done .
negative	a week_later , i received yet another bill from dong .
negative	they were trying to charge me for an_additional three_months of service after i moved out !
negative	i called an got no resolution from telephone customer_service ( i admit - i don_'_t speak danish well , they could not resolve this in english ) so i paid a visit to the dong headquarters in gentoff denmark ( wayyyyyy outside of copenhagen ).
negative	they insisted that i owed the sum even_though their records showed that this new bill was for a period of time i did not reside in the apartment !
negative	there has_been no resolution with dong and they refuse to admit that the bill was an_error .
negative	i am not at all happy with this .
negative	okay , when i moved to germany i got a two year contract with vodafone .
negative	they told me that if i left germany permanently , i could cancel out the contract with no fees and no problem .
negative	a year later , i had to relocate to denmark .
negative	i showed all of the paperwork that i was leaving germany and vodafone refused to allow me to cancel the contract !
negative	their excuse was that i could still use the phone in denmark ( at 0 . 00_euro a minute ) so they couldn_'_t cancel the contract .
negative	then they came back and asked for 000_euro to cancel the contract permanently !
negative	what a terrible thing for vodafone to do to expats !
negative	said they will take books back but when they receive the books they say they only want one .
negative	then they say if you want your book back then pay money for it back .
negative	i don_'_t see that is fair and when asked about it they say they have it on there site .
negative	they were not helpful other the .
negative	where to read .
negative	i am not using them ever again
negative	i tried worthpoints 0 day free_trial because i wanted to look something up and find its value .
negative	i did not find it and went into unsubscribe the very same day i signed_up because i did not want to forget and get charges .
negative	it said my cancellation went through but i noticed they were charging me every_month for the past 0 months .
negative	and double dipping !
negative	0 - $ 0 . 00 charges a couple days apart each and every_month since august_0000 .
negative	i emailed and called and they simply refused to help me or even consider crediting me back for the charges .
negative	do not trust them .
negative	i even googled them and they also have goantiques . com and other_sites .
negative	i also found them on the bbb with a " f " rating with many complaints just like mine !
negative	they simply are not trustworthy so do not give them your credit_card info because if you ever do cancel they mysteriously say ... " no you did not ."
negative	and they will not work with you to help you .
negative	i purchased the ultimate_game card via online delivery to use for lord of the rings online for my son .
negative	there seems to be no possible way to use this card .... the directions for redeeming the online game card do not fit what shows up in the lotr checkout , and when entering the key code it does not work .
negative	i will never use pcgamesupply nor purchase an ultimate_game card ever again ... i just wasted 00 dollars .
negative	i was searching for a solution for my problem hair , which is not split , but dry and rough feeling on the ends of the middle layers , but only at the back .
negative	biolustre description sounded_like it was made for me , so i coughed up £_00 . 00 .
negative	product arrived_promptly , but is complete rubbish !
negative	despite following the instructions to the letter it did no good at all .
negative	don_'_t waste your money on this !
negative	if we could we would give this a negative rating .
negative	bought a visa_gift_card for my mom and had it sent to her address of record .
negative	she went to use it at her nail salon and after she left the place found out they charged her automatically 00_% for a tip , she found this out because she went to her hair salon and found out there was not enough left on it to pay her hair stylist , how embarrassing .
negative	after the fact i went to their website to watch a tutorial and they tell you there if you do not want the 00_% taken out to make_sure to tell the business that and you will tip them yourself .
negative	how conniving and deceiving this whole outfit is !.
negative	never again will we do gift_cards !
negative	they charge you a processing_fee and shipping fee which i knew about , but was ok with it because it was a gift .
negative	and they did not use the picture we used to customize the card with , they put it on the paper the card was attached to .
negative	total ripoff ... do not use this company , especially with vd coming up .
negative	half the flowers ( roses ) were nearly_dead by the time they were delivered .
negative	delivery time was not what they promised .
negative	customer_support was horrible !
negative	buy at your own risk .
negative	i have returned items over 0_weeks_ago and still have no acknowledgement of receipt of the the return or any sign of a refund .
negative	not happy will not be using boohoo again
negative	the cartridges didn_'_t fit my printer .
negative	it made me choose a star , i wouldn_'_t have chosen 0_star
negative	i ordered and paid for $_00 worth of seeds through this website and received confirmation of my order .
negative	despite several emails and phone_calls , the seeds never arrived and no one has ever replied to my communications .
negative	i learned too late , from reviews on other_sites , that this is not unusual for this company .
negative	buyer_beware !
negative	you ' re taking a gamble when you order with this outfit .
negative	called a number of times .
negative	kept telling_me it would be shipped .
negative	was going on trip out of the country .
negative	had to cancel order and purchase locally .
negative	i made a reservation for a hotel which said in the first line of the cancellation_policy , " we realize your plans change and you can cancel your reservation ......" after making the reservation i immediately cancelled it , within 0 minutes , because the cancellation_policy stated further that i would be charged a 00_% cancellation_fee .
negative	i called and spoke with a gentleman_who was reading a script and put me on hold 0 times , only to be told to call tomorrow .
negative	the next_day i got a woman_who was more helpful , put me on hold 0 times , and then said that she would call me back the next_day .... it '_s been 0 days and i still have not heard from anyone and my issue is not resolved .
negative	i do not want to pay a cancellation_fee for a mistake , an oversight on the cancellation_policy , which i tried to fix immediately .
negative	i had booked my two girlfriends in a private_room and myself in a share dorm ( so 0pax in total , all confirmed ); when we got to the hostel , they only had a bkng for 0pax both in the share dorm .
negative	hostel had no private_rooms available , we had to split and my friends ( who had never stayed in a hostel before and really didn_'_t want to share ) had to stay in a mixed dorm .
negative	we lost the whole afternoon trying to sort this out .
negative	my friends were furious and this killed the mood .
negative	the hostel staff was super nice and i know it wasn_'_t their fault , but totally hostelworld '_s .
negative	i ' d like hostelworld to pay me back my 00_% deposit as a small compensation for the stress they caused me ... if that happens , i '_ll have a different opinion and might book through it again , if not , that '_s it - i '_ll just check the list of hostels and then will book it directly
negative	bookit . com failed to notify me that there are no shuttles from my destination airport to my resort - 00_miles_away because i " booked online ".
negative	when i called they told me that if i had called in to an agent to make reservations then thy would have notified me .
negative	isn_'_t the name & purpose of bookit . com to do it online ??!!!
negative	now , 0 days before my trip i am out an extra $_000 because i have to pay for a limo to shuttle my family , a there are no other available transportation methods at thi point .
negative	also i ne ' er received an_email_confirmation until i called to ensure my reservation had been made & had to ask them to send me this information !!
negative	!
negative	today i received a phone_call & email to please contact them regarding the problems i had with this company .
negative	they still did nothing to rectify the problems .
negative	they did not offer to help in any way except to apologize & say to me again that it is my fault for booking online & not calling in to speak wih a professional .
negative	they did tell me how sorry they are , however .
negative	then again , everybody knows that actions speak louder than words .
negative	i did not order what i received and i am thoroughly annoyed .
negative	it '_s as if they just picked_up anything and sent it to me .
negative	not impressed as i needed this nail colour for a big occasion and now what do i do
negative	i '_ve been using travelocity for years to book all of my travel needs .
negative	i also have a travelocity credit_card .
negative	my mac was recently in the shop for a spring cleaning and my cookies were deleted .
negative	so when i booked a recent_trip from montana to chicago and back , i hadn_'_t realized that i didn_'_t sign in and was automatically registered as a guest .
negative	when i went to update my travelocity app i noticed that my flight wasn_'_t being referenced , and using some deductive reasoning , i thought to myself " dratz !
negative	i dropped my cookies !"
negative	so i called travelocity to make_sure i got the credit for my miles and i was told " too bad ... too late ."
negative	what ?
negative	i hadn_'_t even flown yet !
negative	back up !
negative	nope .
negative	" no can do ."
negative	" may i please speak to a manager ," i replied .
negative	" he '_s going to tell you the same thing .
negative	there '_s no way to transfer it from a guest into your name ."
negative	to which i said " of course there is , we can change anything if we want to .
negative	i '_ll hold for a manager ."
negative	while on hold , i got disconnected .
negative	i just booked another flight to chicago directly via united .
negative	with device like that , why use them ?
negative	i originally order a pair of frames and after not hearing anything for a week , i contacted them via their chat service .
negative	their reps are trained to give you the run_around because you can never get straight answers regarding what is going on with your order .
negative	eventually once i asked for a refund magically the order was defective and they asked me to pick out another frame .
negative	i did that and did not hear_anything from them for another week .
negative	again i contacted them through the chat service and again was given the run_around .
negative	i asked for a refund once again because i am tired of the crap and then he said oh it shipped out yesterday but two_days_later there is still no tacking number or anything .
negative	this company is a joke , they are scamming people and their customer_service is horrid !!!!!!!!!!!!!
negative	i simply want my money back but they will not honor my wishes .
negative	that is pure bullshit !
negative	i e_- mailed gadgetgrotto to ask where is my item the camera helmet which i paid for on 00th_november , still had no reply to my e_- mail and obviously no item , not a happy_bunny and although you have many cool products i will pay the extra few_pounds and get excellent service from your competitiors like amazon .
negative	ordered two pair of designer_glasses .
negative	first pair took over 0 month , and still_waiting on second with no word on when it will ship .
negative	had been waiting for 0st pair so long , then opened box to find it packed in a cheap plastic_bag inside an even cheaper looking soft vinyl case .
negative	these were ysl glasses -- expensive .
negative	the site promises that glasses will come with all manufacturer '_s packaging .
negative	not true .
negative	no papers , no cloth , no case .
negative	i have to wonder_if these are simply chinese counterfeits .
negative	i am so disappointed with framesdirect , i cannot begin to describe .
negative	meanwhile , since i needed glasses , i ordered two pair from coastal and received both within one ( 0 ) week , along with cleaning_cloth , lens cleaner , and original designer cases .
negative	plus , coastal had better prices and much_better customer_service .
negative	go_ahead and buy from framesdirect if you want , but just be aware that it may take_forever and a day , with little to no contact or customer_service or information on your order , and the glasses may well not come with original packaging ( as_promised on the website and is de rigeur for any designer_glasses anywhere ).
negative	what a waste of money ( yeah , close to $ 0 , 000 ).
negative	never again .
negative	i was mislead by the original representative , who made me believe i was going to be getting an upgraded suite at the government rate .
negative	when i checked in and it was just a regular room , i called to complain and was again mislead by another representative whom told me she would esculate my issue to her manager and that i would receive a phone_call or email within 00_hours .
negative	when no email or phone_call was received , i called again and they told me the record said i had tried to call to cancel .
negative	never use this company , i was told lie after lie and never had my issue_resolved .
negative	note : i am rating them 0_star due to unacceptable experience .
negative	at no time was anyone ever rude to me .
negative	this is an attempt to get resolution to my situation that has not been resolved over several phone_calls and emails .
negative	in february_0000 , i booked a hotel stay through_travelocity . com .
negative	my credit_card statement and the email_confirmation reflect this .
negative	however , when i called on april 0 , 0000 to alter the days of my stay customer_service was not able to locate my reservation using the itinerary_number that they issued to me .
negative	after holding for several minutes they determined that my stay was booked through_expedia . com .
negative	what ?
negative	how is that even possible ?
negative	okay ... so they gave_me the phone_number to call expedia . com .
negative	first i tried to call the hotel to see if i could just make_adjustments directly through the hotel .
negative	no dice .
negative	they said that it was indeed booked through_expedia . com and told me i needed to make alteration through_expedia . com .
negative	i called expedia . com and of course they were not able to find my reservation with the travelocity . com itinerary_number .
negative	i was again put on hold and after about 00_minutes i gave up .
negative	i called travelocity back and went through the whole spiel again .
negative	this call lasted 00_minutes and resulted in their determination that it was booked through_travelocity legacy .
negative	i was either transferred and disconnected or given another number to call .
negative	not sure .
negative	most of that time was spent on hold while the kindly lady , who assured_me she would get to the root of the issue , investigated .
negative	i had to hang up after 00_minutes to attend to other life issues .
negative	i gave online customer_service a try on april 0 .
negative	i simply told them my itinerary_number , contact info and a note stating my issue .
negative	the reply acknowledged the name of my hotel without my telling them .
negative	again it is evident they can see the reservation using my email .
negative	they asked for my itinerary_number again ( despite it having been provided in the first email ) > grrrr .
negative	email customer_service was a dead end .
negative	they apologized for the inconvenience and said i had to call them to resolve the issue .
negative	yay ....
negative	i called back on april 00 determined to get resolution .
negative	again i had to give the whole spiel to a new customer_service person .
negative	after many periods of explaining and being put on hold , he found my reservation and happily forwarded the confirmation to me .
negative	that '_s great but not what i wanted .
negative	he consulted with other representatives with more technical savvy and determined they could see my reservation but could not access my account to make_changes .
negative	he would have to transfer me to travelocity legacy .
negative	seriously wtf_?
negative	i begged him to not put me on hold .
negative	i asked if the person he was transferring me to would be briefed on the situation of if i would have to start from the beginning explain the story .
negative	unfortunately , he did not understand what i was asking .
negative	i was transferred and by this time i was super mad .
negative	i gave her the story up front and told her everything they told me about my account and it was as though she wasn_'_t even listening .
negative	" give me your itinerary_number please ," she said .
negative	this called lasted 0 hour and 00 freaking minutes .
negative	she eventually came to the conclusion herself that she could not alter my reservation on her system .
negative	she said she would call the hotel and talk with them and alter the days of my stay for me .
negative	i waited on hold while she did that .
negative	she got back on and said , " i was able to cancel the three_days and your credit_card will be refunded x - number of dollars ."
negative	> holy moly !!
negative	happy dance !
negative	< that was quickly deflated when i asked her to send me a confirmation number of this transaction .
negative	unfortunately since she was not able to make alterations on her system she could not generate a confirmation number .
negative	paranoid something was lost in translation and i would not have a reservation at all , i reviewed the days of my stay at_least three_times with her .
negative	it took a leap of faith to hang up and trust that my credit_card would be refunded .
negative	when i checked in at the hotel , the new departure_date was correct .
negative	whew .
negative	the hotel was great !
negative	it is now more than a month after that phone_call and my credit_card has still not been credited .
negative	i plan to call them back and fully expect zero results .
negative	in the meantime i shall flood the social_media outlets with this negative rant in hopes they are concerned_about their reputation .
negative	would i recommend them based on this experience ?
negative	absolutely not !
negative	i was contemplating a law suit .
negative	i was definitely discriminated against .
negative	i think that my instructor would not let_me pass and certify for this course because i am a massage_therapist and not a physical_therapist , or occupational therapist .
negative	i got a 00_% on the exam , did all the pre_- qualifying homework and passed every one of those tests .
negative	i took the full course , paid in full , and qualified for a " good " rating in my bandage wrapping .
negative	the instructor called me up in front of the class and drilled me on some of the questions that had i missed on the test , of which i passed with a 00_%.
negative	i did not know the answers , she got loud , enough for everyone to hear , and discussed why i should know these answers , and demanded that i agree with her .
negative	i told her if i agreed with her , that she would not pass me .
negative	i said , ' what it sounded_like to me is , that is what she wanted , that she was leading me to agree and she would fail me '.
negative	when i told her this , she said nothing further .
negative	as a 00 year veteran massage_therapist and instructor of massage , ( anthem college an 000 hour , full time position , of five years !)
negative	i felt that i would pass the practical ... well , i did not pass .
negative	i saw her complete attention on me , singling me out , during the practical , while my co - students - all of which , were physical therapists , were just " led to slide by " without the scrutiny of the instructor , which was on me .
negative	i felt i did the practical as well as my co - students .
negative	i was allowed another attempt at the practical .
negative	my instructor chose the most difficult , ( which i over heard other co - student pt '_s say was the hardest ).
negative	i did not pass , although as a massage_therapist myself , knowing that with practice , and more attention to instruction , am confident i would master these routines .
negative	the instructor said that i had perfect technique , but failed me due to a few mistakes in my routine !
negative	i also documented that i heard my instructor tell several other pt '_s ( when they asked why a massage_therapist was in the school ) that a " fly - by - night massage_therapist could not come in here for certification ".
negative	simply put , i was told when we started the class , that she would not fail anyone for the practical only , that we would have plenty of time to master the techniques .
negative	i failed to receive my certification for the practical only .
negative	i could recite the entire concept of anastomosis and the concept of mld .
negative	i passed all exams , and the bandaging .
negative	there is nothing else to pass except the routine !
negative	( which was biased and under the scrutiny of one single instructor !)
negative	i had practiced before the practical , with my fellow students , and could do the routines just as good as them , ( before testing in the practical !)
negative	but , she failed me , and i think it was strictly discriminatory .
negative	i firmly believe that your company only wants pt '_s and ot '_s to have this certification , and not massage therapists !
negative	travelocity has no problem with having the worst customer_service i have ever_seen .
negative	we booked a trip and had to cancel last_year .
negative	we got our money for the hotel but was told that the air fair could be used within on year of the travel dates .
negative	words from your customer_service .
negative	also said i could only use the fair for the same destination .
negative	both wrong .
negative	when i called to use it , i was told to call the airlines so i did .
negative	they told me you made a mistake and it was one year from the day of booking .
negative	.
negative	well after saving a year to take 0 adopted children on vacation we can not go cause we were past the date .
negative	hummm .
negative	nice .
negative	it '_s neither of your faults right .
negative	i will spend every day while i '_m working in the 00 malls i go too telling_everyone not to use either of you by just telling them my story .
negative	how '_s that for a review .
negative	both you and the airlines don_'_t care about the small fish in your ponds .. right ?
negative	only the money you make by pooing on the small folks .
negative	i bought a purse and 0 pair of jeans .
negative	i paid_extra to have them shipped faster ..... took 0 days .
negative	they said 0 to 0 days .
negative	they got extra money from me there .
negative	then i get the jeans on and thy rip up the back seam .
negative	i then try to return only to find that i pay the return shipping too , almost as much as i played for the crappy merchandise .
negative	so i won_'_t be returning the items , or myself to the website .
negative	the only_thing i can do at this point is cut my losses on the $_00 , and spread the word that this 00dollar_mall are thieves .
negative	it took a month to receive my order .
negative	way to long when you need glasses to see .
negative	i ordered you special on your blinking dog_bone , i got00 od round red light blinkers , you advertized bone ,
negative	not round red blinker , very disapointed
negative	all i can say after talking to a rep and a supervisor is wow !
negative	and i shout it sarcastically .
negative	i went to the site because a co - worker told me that halloweencostumes . com was advertising 00_%_off all costumes .
negative	i clicked on the site link and found the costume that i wanted .
negative	going through the checkout_process , i did not see the advertised promotion deduct from my total .
negative	after i received my receipt , i called customer_service and stated my case .
negative	the rep was very polite , told me that they had a glitch on their site , put me on hold a couple of times to seek counsel and then told me that they would give me 00_%_off instead and that i should keep an eye on my bank_statements ( plural ?
negative	how long will this take ?!)
negative	to see the credit .
negative	she didn_'_t tell me what the total credit would be , couldn_'_t give me a confirmation number and said i wouldn_'_t be getting an_email or anything ... and so i asked for a supervisor because it sounds a little shady .
negative	at that moment , i shouted to my co - worker to let her know that they weren_'_t honoring the 00_%_off so that she wouldn_'_t place her order and be in the unhappy state that i am in .
negative	ruben , a supervisor got on the phone and was also very polite as he nicely told me that there wasn_'_t much he could do .
negative	he explained to me that they were having problems with their emails giving old , expired promo_codes , that their it needed to update their site because they have gotten a lot of complaints about the advertised promotion , and that they were in the business to make money and he could not get an approval on the 00_%_discount because i basically didn_'_t spend enough .
negative	he rambled something to the extent that he can '_t give me my costume for half off what it '_s worth , which is really weird , because i wasn_'_t asking for 00_%.
negative	i explained to him that i wouldn_'_t have ordered from them if it weren_'_t for the 00_%_off ad on the website , and i '_m kicking myself for not buying the same costume through party city who is also running a 00_%_off promotion ( online and in - store with coupon ).
negative	ruben told me that they honor lowest_price match from other stores , but not on percentage_off promotions .
negative	i didn_'_t ask them to match another store '_s promotion ... i was asking them to match the one they advertised .
negative	maybe someone was typing in the credit , maybe someone was writing it down .
negative	after hearing the blah_blah_blah from them , i am more upset and think they should just honor the 00_%.
negative	the costume was $_00 . 00 plus $ 0 . 00 for shipping .
negative	( ha !
negative	he even told me that he couldn_'_t even give me free_shipping because i had to spend at_least $_00 .)
negative	wow !
negative	instead of dealing_with thomas cook who we found very good with other packages , our booking was taken over by olympic holidays .
negative	no boarding_passes or transfers via_email just very basic info re flights .
negative	did not specify which terminal our departure was from gatwick .
negative	it all worked out but not impressed .
negative	i ordered goods from you that i paid for on 00 / 00 / 0000 .
negative	i have never received this item which was a garden quoits game .
negative	despite sending 0 emails asking for details about my order i am yet to receive a reply .
negative	bad customer_service .
negative	rubbish !!!
negative	!
negative	one day after booking my flight , i saw that the price of the same flight went down $_00 .
negative	i filled out the online price guarantee form ( after trying to call and being put on hold for 00_minutes and finally giving up ).
negative	i was later notified that i did not qualify for the price guarantee because i had not booked the flight from my " travelocity account " but rather had used a " single - use " account .
negative	i had just booked my flight like i think most people do - by logging onto travelocity . com .
negative	nowhere does the price guarantee say what kind of account you have to log in from .
negative	if it '_s in the fine_print somewhere , it is well hidden .
negative	travelocity '_s " price guarantee " is meaningless , and advertising that they have a guarantee is fraudulent .
negative	worst_experience and first time ever providing a review on any company or product .
negative	took_forever , uninformed that my lenses could not be repaired .
negative	they sent me a cheap fake that were not attached to the frames and that i couldn_'_t even see clearly through .
negative	horrible and completely unprofessional customer_service ; refused to pay for shipping to send my glasses back a second time and refused to provide a refund .
negative	even went thru amex with no luck .
negative	please save_yourself the time and frustration .
negative	do not deal with this sham of a company .
negative	you are sending emails about an order placed by one of your customers to me ( not a customer ) instead of to her !
negative	i am not your customer .
negative	i responded after the first email , explaining the details and suggested you get a different email address from your customer , but i keep getting emails about her order .
negative	please remove my email address from your database and contact her in some way other than by using my email address .
negative	the bulb didn_'_t work which allowed my friend to tear apart the whole headlight thinking he did something wrong , than had to pay a mechanic $_000 to put it back together .
negative	i know my friend is an_idiot but this just sucks , who would think the bulb wouldn_'_t work ?
negative	oh_yeah made in china
negative	i live in the us and my friend who_lives in the uk got into an accident so i wanted to send her something .
negative	they said it was delivered all tho it never got to and i provided the right address .
negative	im very upset .
negative	i want flowers there or refund .
negative	is this site a scam ?
negative	im going to get to bottom of this .
negative	my money will not be ripped_off .
negative	ordered hedge cutter and received a strimmer !!!
negative	advised them immediately but got no response . sent second e_- mail but the strimmer is still sitting in the porch !!!
negative	to date have heard_nothing from them and the hedge is out of control . not too impressed with their after sales service !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
negative	!
negative	dopo questa recensione oggi mi vedo costretta a scrivere :
negative	ordine 0000 / 0000 del 00 / 00 / 0000 00 . 00 . 00 per 000_euro mai arrivato per cui mi avete fatto un buono spesa , reinvestito con_un altro ordine 0000 / 0000 del 00 / 00 / 0000 00 . 00 . 00 di 000 , 00 per un totale di 000 , 00_euro .
negative	dopo aver fatto un acquisto andato a buon fine anni fa e quindi acquistata la fiducia del cliente avete iniziato a comportarvi in modo scorretto .
negative	fino a che siete riusciti a tergiversare per farsì che passassero i 00gg per_il rimborso tramite carta di credito , tirandola per le lunghe dopo l ' acquisto 0000 / 0000 del 00 / 00 / 0000 00 . 00 . 00 tutto andava bene , scrivevate e rispondevate alle mail anche con una buona tempistica di risposta , poi mi avete offerto un buono per evitache che chiedessi il rimborso , e per concludere non_ho visto un tubo , nè le mie hogan , nè la borsa fendi nè tanto meno la camicia burberry ... siamo in " ballo " da agosto , rivoglio i miei soldi !
negative	abbiate almeno il coraggio di rispondere !!
negative	lo stato dell ' ordine è in " annullato / in rimborso " da tempo , e non mi dite che_ci sono stati problemi oltre al numero della carta di credito in vostro possesso vi ho fornito anche l ' iban per_il bonifico !
negative	00 / 00 / 0000 per di più leggendo i commenti chiedono di attendere i termini della consegna non fatelo altrimenti non rivedrete piu ' come me i vostri soldi hanno tirato alla lunga da luglio ben 0 ordini , mi_hanno fregata perchè gli ho dato fiducia sapendo che erano lenti e così sono caduta nella trappola !
negative	fatevi restituire subito i vostri soldi !
negative	hanno anche il coraggio di dire di scrivere al servizio_clienti ... ma se tanto alle centinai di mail manco si degnano di rispondere e dietro alla nuova " ragione sociale " mi vien tanto da pensare che_ci siano sempre loro !!
negative	!
negative	i was extremely disappointed with the size and quality of the trees i received .
negative	unfortunately i found the same crape myrtle at a better price and much larger after i planted these .
negative	lesson_learned .
negative	so_far not impressed , ordered a week_ago and still have not received my package ...
negative	yeah it sucks . i got the wrong order and then , they were out of what i wanted .
negative	the dress arrived very promptly but one of the diamonds was falling_off .
negative	i immediately emailed the company .
negative	it is now several days after the email and i have not gotten a response .
negative	why would they tell you to email them if they plan on ignoring your question ?
negative	this dress was almost 000_dollars and i don_'_t expect it to be in less_than perfect_condition and it was .
negative	very displeased with the customer_service !!!!!!
negative	!
negative	my order was cancelled but no email was sent .
negative	i realized it when the book did not arrive and my payment was credited_back on my credit_card .
negative	will never shop there again regardless of the price .
negative	i haven_'_t recieved my product after 0 , 0 month .
negative	i have contacted country_attire , but they won_'_t send a new one or give me my money back .
negative	so now i have paid for a product that has not arrived , and probably_won_'_t .
negative	i will never order from this site , ever again
negative	what more can i say i used to sell on ebay but a dispute with paypal has made it off limits
negative	i fell foul of paypal '_s weirder rules a few_years_ago which resulted in me having to get a passport and then fax it to the office in the us before i could have my refund back .
negative	they were so surly and rude because i was a foreigner - even_though the transaction happened in this country and between two subjects of this country - that i have never been back to them which also means i don_'_t use ebay
negative	terrible service !
negative	will never use them again !
negative	i was suspicious about the perfume that i bought - prada infusion 000mls , as the scent did not last very long on me , and i have been wearing this perfume for years so i know how it wears .
negative	i contacted prada via their website , and they do not actually produce a 000ml bottle , therefore this is fake .
negative	i booked two_nights at a town about 0 0 / 0 hours from my house , but due to a blizzard and hazardous road conditions .
negative	i canceled directly with the hotel and then canceled with travelocity .
negative	this was on the morning of check - out .
negative	the hotel said that is was not a big deal and canceled the reservation .
negative	i was still charged for night at the hotel .
negative	i followed_up with customer_service , but no response .
negative	i will keep my money and my safety and never use this service again .
negative	i ordered two items , and both items were sent to me but not what i ordered .
negative	we ordered some embroidered shirts .
negative	they assured us that we would have them on time for a convention we needed them for .
negative	i checked in two_days before they were suppose to arrive because i hadn_'_t gotten any notification that they shipped .
negative	they informed me that i wouldn_'_t be able to get them - that somehow it had been delayed .
negative	i told them to cancel the order - they said they couldn_'_t .
negative	i went to a local place in desperation and they said they would help me out and get them done fast .
negative	two_days_later i picked them up and they looked awesome .
negative	three_days_later the shirts from zazzle arrived and they were so bad .
negative	the embroidery image was too big and the stitching so so loose - it didn_'_t look professional at all .
negative	worst i '_ve ever_seen .
negative	i called to complain_about the quality and the fact that they totally missed my delivery date .
negative	finally , after several calls to them and complaining they agreed to refund my money .
negative	we haven_'_t and wont use them again .
negative	i definitely left my iphone in my taxi on a thursday_night - the driver wouldn_'_t own up to it !
negative	so i shall never be using such a mistrust worthy site again .
negative	appalling customer_service afterwards .
negative	i have waited in the house the whole day for my parcel to be collected as arranged between 00 - 00_hrs and 00 - 00_hrs , but to no_avail as the couriers did not turn up , we have not had any ' phone_call to advise of a problem and have i feel not received any service whatsoever .
negative	i tried to contact the office after trying tracking to see if courier was on the way at around 00 - 00_hrs but having had no reply can only think office is closed .
negative	the one stare awarded is because the order was easy to place , though not followed through
negative	prices are nice but if you factor in that the shipping is 0 times more than their competitors the prices are just average .
negative	$_00 for shipping is quite outrageous .
negative	i placed an order 0 days ago and the website states they are still filling the order .
negative	horrible !
negative	don_'_t waste your time .
negative	the only_thing worth rating them one star for , are the prices .
negative	otherwise , a complete inconvenient hassle !!
negative	when i first made the purchase , the glasses i chose were " in stock ".
negative	but then all of a sudden the next moment they were back ordered .
negative	hmm go figure .
negative	why do you offer glasses that are not in stock , only to receive unhappy_customers and negative_reviews ?
negative	its been almost a month and my glasses still_haven_'_t even been sent out yet .
negative	yeah , well you better get on that express delivery and all i '_m going to say is i better not get a pair of scratched or broken glasses .
negative	seems to me my complaints are almost identical to everyone elses complaints .
negative	get some better customer_service .
negative	would never recommend .
negative	after i receive my purchase , i will no_longer be doing_business with sbg .
negative	i have heen ordering from asda for weeks , and every week i have a problem with the products .
negative	for example once i received plums with fungus growing on , then today i found out tortilla bread that i ordered was already off on the day i got my delivery :_d absolutely redicilous , once i ordered my one month old baby infacol , they sent me calpol from 0plus months , or once i ordered brown hair dye they sent me red instead :_d , or sometimes they just leave something delivered , i have so many stories to tell ... and delivery prices are absolutely mad , last time i paid 0 pound for fungus plums and gone off bread ,
negative	please people avoid asda , it might be cheap but the products you gonna be getting are awful .
negative	i rather pay more money for quality products and good serivice .
negative	absolutely fed up with asda , and never gonna order online again
negative	when i notified silvertribe that my shipment ( my second order with them ) had gone missing between my local post_office and my home , the company refused to help me resolve the issue .
negative	in fact , a manager accused me of having received the item and lying about it !
negative	silvertribe ships usps " signature confirmation ," and a postal employee had signed for my package ( i suspect it was stolen at the post_office ).
negative	silvertribe customer_service took the position that the package had been " delivered and signed for ," even_though the signature receipt had another person '_s name on it and the post_office '_s address .
negative	i have never encountered such obstinate and unprofessional sellers online , which is saying a lot .
negative	i needed to cancel a trip i had book with them , but after several_attempts to contact them to cancel , i was never able to speak to a person , i left my phone_number to supposedly receive a call back from their customer_support , never got a call , e_- mailed never got a response .
negative	no one seems to actually work for customer_support !
negative	terrible , book your trip somewhere_else , this place is horrible !!!!
negative	!
negative	i have been trying for a week to get an item back .
negative	first agency for collect_+ told me the system was down , the second agency i called at told me the item had been scanned twice and was in the system and suggested i went via_royal_mail .
negative	i went to the post_office and was told they couldn_'_t accept it as it was courier only .
negative	i went back to the original agency and they told me i would have to ring courier + to get it taken off the system .
negative	i '_m furious and i will never use very again .
negative	decided to rent a car through priceline .
negative	went to pick the car up and they wanted even more money plus the deposit i already knew about the deposit but wasn_'_t aware that they didn_'_t keep_up with the deals with priceline !
negative	called to get my money back and was denied it !!
negative	then i look at my receipt and there it says non_refundable !!!
negative	never during the whole_process of setting_up the reservation did it tell me this until they got my card information and took my money !!
negative	and i still did not get a rental_car !!!
negative	!
negative	site showed rooms available , but when i tried to book them , they were gone .
negative	started over , rooms still show available .
negative	tried four different hotels and all the same .
negative	gave up and used another website .
negative	waste of time and complete frustration !
negative	we were so excited to take the big_bus_tour in london and ppicked a beautiful day to do so .
negative	since there are many companies_offering this service we didn_'_t do any research to find the best .
negative	our tour started well until we decided to get off the bus .
negative	it was nearly_impossible to get back on the bus and to get a seat .
negative	we rode through major_attractions standing on the ground_floor of the bus not being_able to see anything .
negative	it was a horrible scramble at the bus_stops to beat others onto a bus .
negative	when i asked about being oversold they told me on a nice day they can '_t guarantee a seat !
negative	this is a very expensive event for a family and was chaotic and a disappointment .
negative	the customer_service from big_bus was horrible .
negative	surprising given they have so much competition .
negative	the fact that we had to take a second bus to get to fox should have been a dead giveaway .
negative	the guy at the counter was surly , the selection of cars out in the lot for a " full - size " abysmal ... one was without a clicker , had the box containg the window and door open / close buttons literally flopping around and was a scratch and dent festival .
negative	when we had to extend for an extra day and a half it wound_up being more than the original rental which was more than i was quoted on the phone .
negative	do yourself a favor and don_'_t deal with these_guys .
negative	i booked with autoeurope to rent a car at heathrow_airport in london .
negative	we took the courtesy bus to the europcar office ( autoeurope had booked us with europcar ), and arrived there about 00 am on saturday_morning , sept , 0 , 0000 .
negative	it was a mad house at europcar !
negative	there was a line out the door of the building !
negative	we had to stand in the queue a total of 0 . 0 hours just to get up to one of the service agents .
negative	( i have photos of the office and the crowds if you would like me to send them to you ) there were maybe 0 agents working and all the rest of the desks were empty .
negative	and each agent worked extremely slowly !
negative	they saw the crowds but apparently did not care that we all had to wait for such an extremely long time .
negative	they made no attempt to hurry or to call on more agents to come help customers .
negative	i have no_complaints with the car i was given , but such a long , long wait time to get the car is unacceptable , and should be to autoeurope , too !
negative	you should not book people with such a customer un - friendly rental_car agency .
negative	everyone is the queue was complaining .
negative	when one rents a car , they need to get the car quickly so they can get to where they need to go .
negative	this long_queue set our trip back all that much longer so that we didn_'_t arrive at our destination until late that evening .
negative	i '_m sure it set all the customers back as well .
negative	it is just a terrible way to begin a holiday ( or business ) trip , and i hope that autoeurope speaks to europcar or takes some action to ensure that customers that book with autoeurope don_'_t have to suffer in this manner .
negative	i '_ve received the worst customer_service imaginable from this company ... to the point that i believe they ' re sham and will more than likely report them as such to my cc company .
negative	i ordered a bridesmaid_dress from psbridal . com on january 00 ( for a june wedding ), and was quoted 00 - 00 weeks for standard shipping .
negative	to verify some things initially , i attempted to contact them via phone and email repeatedly following the purchase , and it wasn_'_t until almost a month later that i finally got a return call from some person named jeanette ( whose number is - surprise , surprise - now defunct ).
negative	fast forward to present day , may 00 , almost a full month past the max quoted delivery timeline .
negative	still no dress , and no response from the company by phone or email .
negative	i have tried to contact them again and again , for weeks , along with the other two bridesmaids ( who ordered their dresses at the same time , and like me , have received nothing and gotten no response ).
negative	one other bridesmaid was smart enough to order from a different place and received her dress weeks_ago , so needless to say , we '_ve been completely screwed by ps_bridal and now have to figure_out what to do !
negative	adding insult to injury , the dress is now discontinued .
negative	i understand manufacturer delays ( as it seems they have used this as an excuse in the past ) but this goes beyond that - a total lack of concern , care or basic customer_service when they don_'_t even have the courtesy to respond to urgent issues and at_least provide a status_update .
negative	my advice to anyone considering this company - don_'_t do it .
negative	the minimal discount is absolutely not worth the headache and stress , even if the dress does eventually arrive ... smh
negative	where to begin ...!?
negative	i have ordered from my local chinese for a long time , they recently signed_up to just - eat so i thought i would give it a try .
negative	we live directly across the road from the restaurant , they offer free delivery within 0 miles and on orders over_£_00 .
negative	i figured the delivery charge shown on just - eat would be removed at the end but it wasnt .
negative	i contacted live_chat to remedy what i thought was a simple mistake and regretted that decision immediately !
negative	shireen i think her name was , was the worst example of customer_service i have ever_experienced ( working in customer_service myself , trust me that is bad ) if i ever spoke to a customer like that i would be receiving my p00 !
negative	i called the restaurant directly , they have apologised that the just eat site cannot destinguish distances and have offered me discounts on future_purchases .
negative	they even went as far as to recommend i avoid just - eat in future .
negative	not that i needed the warning !
negative	i cancelled the service after my first shipment because it did not contain the product pictured and the kitty_litter had a hole in it and made a mess of the entrance way and stairs of my condo building .
negative	i sent an_email to customer_service one week_ago and have not received any response .
negative	i have purchased & rented_books previously , however this semester the books that i rented was severely damaged and wrote in don_'_t think that '_s the proper way to rent out books ....
negative	i have truly learned my lesson from this company
negative	i did order a par of boots for 000_€ and ecco ( some how ) lose the order .
negative	in return i will get a discount of 00 %... on a new order :-(((.
negative	i dont what a discount , i whant the things i purchased .
negative	sorry .... madeleine
negative	i waited on hold for over an_hour ( 0 hour 0 minutes to be exact ) to no response , and requested contact twice via_email as well , which was promised within 00_hours .
negative	that was more than 000 hours ago and i have still received no response .
negative	you get one 0 bureau credit_report and anything_else is extra over the monthly fee . you get a free report yearly so this is a big rip_off
negative	we rented a car from orlando , florida online through the sixt website .
negative	when we got to the shuttle area meant to take us to the sixt office around 0 am , the phone_number of the 00 hour office they had provided on our receipt gave_us an answering_machine explaining that the office was now closed .
negative	we tried various other numbers that we found online until we got through to the shuttle .
negative	when we arrived at sixt they informed us that they actually had no car for us .
negative	they had over booked and would refund our money as well and bring us back to the airport .
negative	we were informed that the pre paid rental amount would be refunded immediately , however it took multiple phone_calls and days to complete the refund .
negative	we loved the price of the rental which is why we chose the company .
negative	it was disappointing to have such a negative experience .
negative	had the part listed .
negative	ordered it .
negative	charged to my credit_card .
negative	a couple of days_later received a message that the part was out of stock .
negative	i ' d have to reorder in a couple of weeks , they couldn_'_t do this for me .
negative	they did return a credit on my charge card .
negative	i ordered refills for my hp photosmart c0000 which uses cartridges 00 - black and 00 - color .... i receive the 00 color but the other one was marked with a different number and even the size was different than the black 00 empty cartridge .
negative	could you please send me a black 00 cartridge ... my print does not accept the one you sent .
negative	ordered an item for my children and because one or more of your staff made a mistake with the price i will only get one of the samsung tablets i ordered and will have to disappoint one of my children .
negative	i have told all of my friends .
negative	so the only_thing you are getting from me is bad publicity .
negative	i '_ve been a loyal_customer for years_now and for the past few month been having problems unlike ever before .
negative	they keep not sending me items that i ordered and paid for and always all they got to say is .
negative	( as for the missing item we regret to inform that we were not be able to fulfill the remainder of your order .
negative	we had attempted to special order the item from our supplier but the item is not available at this time .)
negative	always which is bunch of b / s its funny because one of the items i didn_'_t receive was still up for sale on the site same size and everything and the customer care person monique said that its out of stock or whatever even thought i told them its in stock !
negative	im so fed up with not receiving items that i paid for / always asking for the money back that they charged for them when it should be refunded automatically without me even asking and having other issues , better yet i shouldn_'_t even have this problem .
negative	i shall not be silent no more because everyone should know what they do this .
negative	the only helpful ami customer help has ever been the ones on facebook they always respond right_away and are very nice and understanding .
negative	but other then that good luck with dealing_with this crap !
negative	nice clothes but they really need to do something about the out of stock thing when the person already bought the items and expect them .
negative	now i have to find new items that are similar and spend shipping and handling money and time to do so .
negative	you sent me the wrong head gasket and it '_s gonna cost me more to return it you wasted my time you should just said you didn_'_t have it in stock ...
negative	so you just made yourself 00 $_00 + 0 dollars for shipping i guess if you do it to enough people you make a good chunk of change , no pride .
negative	... just the bottom dollar !
negative	i am so angry .
negative	my item should be here on 0 . 0 ., they changed it to 00 . 0 . and today it should be 00 . 0 .
negative	what it will be tomorrow ?
negative	i bought another two items and the same thing is happening .
negative	they surely do not have it in stock and make me wait for months :(
negative	we booked a celebrity cruise with a balcony room we would only get balcony rooms since our first cruise .
negative	we have been on 0 cruises and all were great .
negative	imagine the shock when we got an obstructed view we weren_'_t told about a lifeboat to look at on a fully booked cruise .
negative	they had me call travelocity right from the ship all we got was a sorry .
negative	not impressive
negative	i placed my order like i always do .
negative	i have order frome inkfarm several_times and have been supper satisfied with them .
negative	i ordered my ink and within 0 - 0 days , i have it .
negative	i ordered this time and it took about 0_weeks to get my ink .
negative	i may be exagerating some because i did not save my order form , but it was definitely more than 0 days .
negative	i tracked the oder on ups and sent an_email to infarm , i was quite upset .
negative	i will find another ink company .
negative	i made two orders ....
negative	0st order - i received my items within 0_weeks of purchase , except for one item ( human hair_extensions worth almost $_000 ).
negative	my items were all the wrong sizes & they didn_'_t let_me know the extensions were on backorder .
negative	i waited on hold for 00_minutes all 0 times i '_ve called .
negative	it '_s been 0_weeks & i still_haven_'_t received my backorder item or been refunded .
negative	0nd order - i ordered a bathing_suit 00 days ago .
negative	my order still_hasn_'_t been processed & i still_haven_'_t gotten a confimation number from ups ... this is quite interesting considering i paid the extra 0 - day shipping_charges near $_00 .
negative	i will never order from this company again or recommend them to anyone .
negative	i hope you take my advice & save your money & time .
negative	i still_haven_'_t gotten anywhere with them & i '_m sure you wont either ... not to mention , the clothes i received in my order were very low quality .
negative	after booking a hotel through the hotel website , with the option to pay later , i discovered that this was a scam .
negative	the hotel ( somehow ) links - i guess - to reservation_counter which is a " pay now " service for the booking .
negative	when i explained how i booked the hotel on - line through the hotel site all i got was " okay , i see ".
negative	no offer to allow me to continue with the option i chose ( pay later ), no offer to look for other hotels , etc ... the individual was only focused on me keeping the booking , when i got no where and no offer of assistance , i immediately requested that the booking be cancelled .
negative	not feeling very pleased with , what i consider false_advertisement from the hotel to send you to some service ( that supposedly gives you options to pay now or pay later ) and then doesn_'_t work with the customer to arrange for the booking that i initially thought i was getting , doesn_'_t make for a happy consumer .
negative	purchased " mint " condition ipad and received unit with scratches .
negative	no response to my emails to resolve the issue .
negative	unit was also a different model than the one i purchased .
negative	do not buy from this company .
negative	they didn_'_t confirm the booking but they took the money from my bank_account right_away .
negative	didn_'_t receive the tickets and they neither picked_up the phone nor responded to my mail .
negative	not only will i never again buy from this company , but i hope no one ever buys from this company again .
negative	i ordered 0 pairs of glasses and received only 0 pair , although on their website all three_pairs were associated with the same tracking_number , so i could not find out where the other 0 were .
negative	after_contacting the company , they said the remaining 0 pairs were backordered and would give me a 0 %_discount on my order , and i could continue to wait if i wanted to , or cancel the order .
negative	after waiting for another month ( exactly 0 months after_placing the original order ), i decided to cancel my order and return the original pair of glasses .
negative	they sent me a a return_slip for the pair i received and cancelled the 0 remaining pairs .
negative	it has now been 0 month since the order was canceled , and i still have not received my refund .
negative	they said there was a " delay in their system " and will be contacting " a related department " to re - process the refund .
negative	this seems shady to me .
negative	it has again been 0 week since this last email , and i still have not received my refund for the returned pair or canceled pairs , totaling $_000 . 00 .
negative	i am unsure if i will ever receive my refund , and believe this company to a scam .
negative	i plan to continually contact them until i receive my money , and will update this review if that does happen .
negative	i hope this review will deter any customers contemplating ordering from smartbuyglasses , as they deserve to know the truth .
negative	and , if my refund is received , i hope future customers see that even if a refund is received , it will take a very , very long time .
negative	please , do not order from them .
negative	they are a shady , shady company .
negative	the process runs_smoothly until you actually place / pay for your order .
negative	the design process was a breeze .
negative	however , my order was placed over a month_ago and i have received no update as to when the order will actually ship .
negative	there is no customer_service and you can never talk to a live_person .
negative	when i did finally receive a response apologizing for the delay , it was never clear as to when the order would ship .
negative	i have missed the client '_s deadline and still have no tracking to even prove my order has shipped .
negative	i will be sure to use a domestic supplier from here on out .
negative	she was unwilling to answer my questions and when she did it was with an attitude .
negative	i would suggest she take some training from the operators in laughlin .
negative	i taught school for many years and had days the job was hard .
negative	you learn to put your feelings aside .
negative	she must know she will be a senior_citizen someday .
negative	do you really pay_attention to these opinions ?
negative	the treats arrived crushed by the dog_food it was packaged with .
negative	it was little more than an exploded bag of crumbs .
negative	very disappointed .
negative	i recently ordered 0 personalised egyptian cotton bath set towels and 0 personalised egyptian cotton hand towels (' his and hers ', black & pink ) as an anniversary_gift !
negative	it turned_out that the towels are of extremely bad quality , so bad that we actually cannot use them at all ( little fibres comes off the towels , you cannot dry off , body is still wet afterwards and full of fibres and its everywhere , the whole bathroom is a mess , very poor quality of towels ).
negative	i have washed to towels about 00 times and it just doesn_'_t get any better .
negative	i paid £_00 for this towels and i cannot_believe what i got for my money !
negative	i am extremely disappointed .
negative	i have reported this to amy ’ sgifts . co . uk but amy doesn_’ t care .
negative	she doesn_’ t want to give me a refund !
negative	i booked a trip through bookit . com and paid in full and somehow bookit sent me the correct reservations but the hotel received the incorrect information and bookit assured_me they are fixing the problem but they are not !!!!
negative	i have spent hours and hours trying to contact corporate bookit managers or anyone to help me but no !!!!!!
negative	will never use bookit again !!!!
negative	idiots !!!!
negative	!
negative	this company have no customer_service to speak of .
negative	i took up their offer of a £_00 voucher but when i ordered the item couldn_'_t use it and was debited with the full_amount . so i phoned them at great expense and they said they couldn_'_t apply the voucher but would have to call back the first vac and reorder .
negative	which_meant i was debited twice .
negative	the returns pack never reached the recipient - it was a gift . obviously they want to hold_onto my money awhile longer . im still_waiting and i am telling_everyone buy through amazon not with these useless people . their product is good but the rest of the service is abysmal . i think they are stupid - firstly why not just credit me with the £_00 voucher an the debited full_amount . secondly what about the expense and embarresment of picking_up one vac only to redeliver exactly the same item ! bizarre ?
negative	thirdly suspect that nobody in the company can read and they have sent the pick_up pack to the billing_address not the recipient . would never recommend this company . good old amazon rules .
negative	b debenham
negative	i ordered and paid for my book and the order was excepted .
negative	i wait for my book to be shipped .
negative	then i checked to see why i had not received it and found a post saying refund .
negative	i didn_'_t receive notice from bookbyte , so i emailed them then they emailed me back saying sorry no one contacted me that the book was out of stock and my money would be refunded .
negative	wow is all i could say .
negative	my class started in 0 days , so i had to find another company and i did they shipped in 0 days got my book on time , and mind you i paid for express shipping .
negative	unacceptable
negative	we have never used them before so decided to give them a go wish ee had not of bothered .
negative	we arrived and was told they did not even know we had booked but it was fine they could accommodate .
negative	the vechicle used to take us to the airport was faulty , it kept cutting out !
negative	on our return_journey the driver seemed as though he had just woken up , although we did return at0 . 00am still unacceptable .
negative	this made his driving slightly nerveraking .
negative	on arrival at our car we were left waiting for 00_minutes in the car_park as his did have our keys but " misplaced " them .
negative	when he finally found them under his drivers car_seat we were eventually able to start on the rest of our return_journey .
negative	i would never ever use these people again complete amateurs .
negative	all the reviews on their site were great , i saw nothing on the site that states in advance that if you receive the wrong part , whether or not it is your fault , you must pay the shipping to send it back !
negative	their phone_number has very limited hours , they do not answer , ( i ’ ve tried for days ) and don_’ t have an option to talk to a human unless it is about your card being declined .
negative	everything must be done through support tickets .
negative	i ordered a gas_cap for a 0000_ford_taurus , after doing research to make_sure it was the correct cap , & using the correct_part number .
negative	when complete , the website showed the correct information , stating confirmation emails would follow .
negative	the confirmation_email stated they were sending a different part numbered product & that nothing could be done to change the order .
negative	i hoped it was the correct_part & only had a different number because it was an internal office number .
negative	when the part came it was clearly_marked as a mazda gas_cap !
negative	does not fit my ford !!
negative	!
negative	i '_m very frustrated & won_'_t purchase from them again .
negative	whilst wrens seem to have a good handle on the production and delivery of their kitchen units they have been extremely poor at managing their work surface sub contractor rotherhams .
negative	they failed to deliver in accordance with the originally presented specification and told me that they are happy with a surface , quote “ full of heavy pitting with a fairly rough finish to the surface ", and therefore so should i be .
negative	to make_matters worse i e_- mail them every twenty days and they dont take the trouble to follow_up my concerns .
negative	i was hesitant to use viagogo when i realized it was a site for ticket scalpers , but it was paypal certified .
negative	so , i purchased tickets for a soccer game in france as a gift for my son '_s first overseas trip .
negative	he really wanted to see a game in europe .
negative	since our time was limited , i specifically chose a game on a date i knew we ' d be able to attend .
negative	i paid three_times the sticker price for the tickets , but wanted to make_sure we had good seats .
negative	when the tickets arrived they were for a different date and at a time when we would be on our way back to the states .
negative	i immediately notified viagogo and have had numerous email exchanges with about the bait and switch .
negative	because the company does not have a working phone_number or direct email , it is impossible to actually have a conversation with a representative of the company .
negative	i just keep getting stock email answers back with no option for a dialogue .
negative	at no time was i notified by either the seller or viagogo that the date of the game had changed , nor was the correct date for the game changed on the listing until 0 days before the game - after i filed my complaint .
negative	by that time i was stuck with 0 useless tickets and terribly disappointed son .
negative	its unlikely we will be overseas again anytime_soon .
negative	so , when i tried to re - sell them on the site , viagogo denied the listing because there was insufficient time .
negative	you can be sure viagogo got a hefty cut of my losses - they take a fee from both the seller and the buyer .
negative	i am also very surprised that paypal endorses this company especially in light of the numerous blogs and websites with negative_reviews of viagogo .
negative	0 / 0 / 00 : reply to viagogo :
negative	of course viagogo can '_t control when event dates are changed .
negative	however , i purchased tickets for a specific date and the seller sent me tickets for a different date .
negative	neither the seller nor viagogo notified me the date changed .
negative	nor did the viagogo website or packing_slip with the tickets indicate a change in date .
negative	neither of you warned me or gave_me the opportunity to back out of the transaction .
negative	this is a breach of contract .
negative	if i ordered and paid for a toaster oven , and amazon sent me an iron with a packing_slip that said toaster oven , they would honorably correct the situation .
negative	i understand the seller sends tickets to viagogo who packs and ships them .
negative	a reputable business would ensure that the buyer was getting what they ordered or would notify the buyer if there was a substitution being sent .
negative	viagogo '_s reply states they do everything they can to inform the customer of changes in events , yet they did nothing in this case .
negative	if viagogo truly cared_about the " inconvenience " it apologizes for , it would accept responsibility for sending me the wrong product and ruining my son '_s vacation .
negative	00 / 0 / 00 update_:
negative	i received a phone message from viagogo that they were looking into my situation with management .
negative	that was on 00 march .
negative	i have not heard back .
negative	i tried_calling the number displayed on caller id the company does not accept land_line calls and i do not have an international plan for my cell_phone .
negative	i wish the company would update me on my request .
negative	thank_you .
negative	00 / 0 / 00 update_:
negative	i received another phone message from viagogo that they were looking into my situation .
negative	that was over 0_weeks_ago , and still no contact back .
negative	i don_'_t_believe the company is interested in customer_service .
negative	i '_ve yet to speak with an actual_person .
negative	you need a customer_service line that has a person to answer it .
negative	it is all fine and good to order what you know you need online , but when ever there is a problem with your order being put on hold for over 0 hours or placing an_email with a 00 hour response is unacceptable
negative	when i questioned my bill i was basically told off .
negative	they threatened to rip it all up .
negative	it '_s just that the price was twice as much as they quoted me , 0 times as much as i paid someone last_year and it had a lot of mistakes .
negative	i ordered a part and was told it was in stock and i would have it in 0 to 0 business days , well 00 business days_later i still dont have the part and i have called everyday and can not reach a sales_associate and if i try to cancel the orded i will be charged a restocking_fee , never again
negative	i was looking to order my pet frontline online and decided to compare prices prior to ordering .
negative	i came_across the petflow site which seemed to have reasonable prices ; before i completed my order i looked up a coupon_code that said i would save 00 . 00 on my first order .
negative	as i was continuing through with the order process i could see where the 00 . 00 was subtracted and i was also given free_shipping .
negative	websites that i normally order from let you review your order in its entirety prior to final confirmation .
negative	you are asked to choose if you want monthly continual shipping or other forms and this is where i chose a one time shipment and the order then went through .
negative	when i realized the 00 . 00 was added back on i contacted customer_service and i was told because i chose a one time shipment and not continual shipment my discount was deducted .
negative	wrong and bad customer_service .
negative	if this choice was taking away your discount there should be a box that pops_up telling you because you chose a one time shipment you will not receive the discount previously applied .
negative	i believe this was a deceiving way to get customer to order and will not order from this company in the future .
negative	i have alerted all my pet owning friends and coworkers about this .
negative	you '_ve lost several potential_customers .
negative	this should not be called a car dealer ship they sell broken junk and lie when they they say thay will fix something .
negative	0 mo i had been fixing broken things .
negative	never again .
negative	my experience with ordering from yesstyle has_been far from satisfying .
negative	first of all , it takes long time to wait for the items to be shipped .
negative	and , the order status page is not helpful .
negative	they keep you wondering when will the order be finally shipped !
negative	the lacking of shipment flexibly and strict return_policy send the message that the company does not take customers ' satisfaction serious enough .
negative	my suggestion_: read through its policies closely before purchasing anything from them .
negative	i purchased several items from this company .
negative	one of them was a " savory prime butcher bone " ( ham bone ).
negative	my dog gobbled up the entire thing in minutes ... a bone , meant to be chewed on for a while .
negative	it crumbled and shared into really sharp pieces .
negative	we are so lucky that our two year_old boxer mix only got violently ill , vomiting and pooping that night all over our house .
negative	thank_god no damage inside as far as perforated organs .
negative	after looking on line i read you should never give a dog a ham bone because of how hurt dogs can become .
negative	i called the company and asked them why they would sell an item that could hurt a dog ... they referred me the co that is the maker of the bone .
negative	they wouldn_'_t even give me my $ back ( 0 . 00 ) for the bone .
negative	they did , however , give a postage paid label for the rest of the order that i wanted to return .
negative	i would think they would have no problem also paying me back a lousy 0 . 00 for the item that could have easily killed my dog .
negative	( just to do good business ).
negative	i notice they are still selling the item even after i explained how bad of a product it is for dogs .
negative	they even asked for my review !
negative	having received dvd '_s that had no movie whatsoever , snowy & lines in picture .
negative	received dvd '_s that claimed cc on package ......... had no cc .
negative	seems like those dvd '_s that were made in mexico are inferior & lack in knowledge of copying which is not kosher as we all know that usa has a better knowledge of copying , otherwise , all dvd '_s that have the " thrown in jail and fined " for copying , seems to be " out of place " in this instance .
negative	i returned my last shipment , as it was short one dvd ( was charged for a full 0 and received 0 ), as cc was missing on 0 , and contact with oldies ( told me they would get back with me after phone_call ... they did not ), was useless , so returning them seemed the right alternative .
negative	will certainly not order anymore from them again , as their employees seem to not get anything properly sent , and lack judgment in phone_calls .
negative	the woman_who reserved my storage_unit misspelled my name , so the storage_facility showed no record of me reserving a storage_unit .
negative	i had to start all over again .
negative	it made my move across the country much harder .
negative	my experience : it '_s not worth using the service to book flights , cars and hotels if anything at all changes at the last_minute .
negative	you ' re much_better off to create your agenda individually and directly with each entity ... airline ... car_rental ... hotel .
negative	that way if you need to change anything , you are able to do that without a hassle .
negative	we had a family emergency that changed our circumstances for dates and times . and weren_'_t allowed to change one single thing on the reservation without negating the entire reservation .
negative	it was an expensive learning experience .
negative	once they have your money , no on even wants to hear_anything from you either .
negative	don_'_t do it .
negative	i placed my order on june_00th and added a priority_mail for $_00 . 00 .
negative	metro_swim shop charged and posted my credit_card on july 0st so i called customer_service to get shipping and tracking_information and the person and i talked to the phone said he will email me my tracking_information and up to this day i have not received it .
negative	i called customer_service twice and have no_idea when my itms was shipped they said it was only processed .
negative	i am very disappointed about my service .
negative	i have your your prices are cheaper_than other_sites but i d_rather pay a little more like swim outlet . com because they are very good in communicating about your order .
negative	i order my dog_food and treats .
negative	not over an_hour later , my phone rings with a salesperson trying to get me to have automatic delivery for the dog_food even_though i checked the radio button that said " one time delivery only " each time it popped_up .
negative	one top of that , within one day , my inbox had four email advertisements as well as three emails about my order - one asking me if i didn_'_t make a mistake bu choosing " one time delivery only ".
negative	blood_pressure going up !
negative	after three_days , i have decided never , ever to order from these_folks again .
negative	in three_days , i received 00 emails from them .
negative	i have unsubscribed and want to warn_others that this company is very irritating .
negative	top top it off .... the dog_treats i ordered are unusable as they were totally crushed in shipping .
negative	all i have is expensive dog treat dust .
negative	called for help at north_shore commercial for help and he was not able to help .
negative	did not provide any info on how to return the remote i purchased .
negative	this was a waste of money and i will not order from them again .
negative	we booked the tour , didn_'_t complete the whole trip as we visited a number of museums and other experiences .
negative	the second day after visiting museums and harrods we then got on the bus hoping to go across to covent_garden .
negative	sadly and with no warning , the bus terminated at baker_street at 0 :_00pm .
negative	after waiting several minutes the driver came upstairs to advise ourselves and the other three parties to get off the bus .
negative	great considering you are along way from attractions and when your travelling with a child .
negative	i made a complaint to the company nearly two_weeks_ago and they have not responded .
negative	we should have been advised when we boarded the bus that it was the last service .
negative	would not recommend as good value for money and would not use again
negative	i was overcharged for an item i purchased by your site .
negative	i was charged 00 times instead of once and contacted immediately asking to get the 00 charged in error refunded and i had to wait a week for a reply and then i was only refunded 0 !!!!
negative	i had to email again and ask again and wait again and hope and pray i actually get a response !!
negative	ridiculous
negative	my sister had recommended the site .
negative	i found the book i wanted at a great price .
negative	i placed my order which was easy and picked express shipping because i needed it for my current class .
negative	it was worth the extra_cost even_though i '_m on a tight_budget .
negative	the book never got here .
negative	when i contacted customer_service , i '_m told
negative	" we are sorry but it appears to be lost ".
negative	they didn_'_t have a replacement .
negative	they said they would give me a refund but i still_haven_'_t received the money in my account .
negative	i don_'_t have the book i need and if i wanted to buy it somewhere_else it will cost me 0 times the amount i was going to pay and my class will almost be over .
negative	not at all happy with my experience !
negative	je_suis actuellement aux usa , où j ' avais loué à partir du 0 octobre jusqu ' au 00 octobre une voiture .
negative	hors je_n ' ai_pas pu avoir ma location et_j ' ai dû payer une nouvelle location sous prétexte que mon mari qui est le conducteur a un permis américain .
negative	cela fait des années quand nous venions aux usa que nous louions par autoescape avec_le permis américain de_mon mari sans_problème , cela change .
negative	mais dans ce cas pourquoi autoescape nous a loué un véhicule ?
negative	?
negative	je leur ai envoyé un mail le 0 octobre j ' attends toujours la réponse , surtout que_j ' ai un autre contrat avec eux du 00 au 00 octobre également aux usa , vais - je devoir à nouveau repayer une location , en attendant aucune réaction d ' autoescape alors que le problème est urgent , mais c ' est vrai eux ils ont encaissé mes paiements .....
negative	i would not buy this item as it is to difficult to set - up , you need someone that has iron muscles and strong hands .
negative	it does not work on chairs without arms .
negative	it is not worth the money i paid for it and i am returning it .
negative	this business ( expedia ) has horrible ratings .
negative	i couldn_'_t agree more .
negative	i wish i knew that before i bought anything through them .
negative	the guy on the phone for cs was hard to understand since he was from another country .
negative	he couldn_'_t answer any of my simple questions .
negative	i asked if i could receive points for my latest booking and he said i could not and he couldn_'_t tell me why due to confidentiality .
negative	which made no sense and he couldn_'_t even explain_why .
negative	he offered me a 00 $ coupon for next time booking .
negative	i asked why i received that and all he could say it was from an agent '_s error but he refused to pull up the paperwork / file to give me info on it .
negative	expedia is nuts !
negative	ordered a mattress protector and didn_'_t realize it didn_'_t encase the mattress .
negative	when i called to return it , lisa , was rude and wanted to argue the fact .
negative	when i told her it didn_'_t say non returnable she rudely told me it said that on the website ... somewhere !!!
negative	geez what a charmer !
negative	i '_ll buy my moms very expensive diapers " somewhere " else lisa .
negative	great customer_service , you should consider not working with the public .
negative	and northshore , consider flagging the files that are non returnable as other_sites do !
negative	!
negative	coupon_codes don_'_t work .
negative	customer_service gives you a credit to keep your business .
negative	then the " system " won_'_t let you apply the credit .
negative	customer_service corrects the problem and sends an_email with accurate information .
negative	order processes completely incorrectly and drops the credit and coupon_code , charging you full price again and again .
negative	is it the system or the people working it ?
negative	i have no_idea .
negative	it '_s less troublesome to drive to the store and walk out with the bag .
negative	ik bestelde een boeket via regiobloemist omdat ze nog dezelfde werkdag een levering beloofden .
negative	mijn boeket heeft er uiteindelijk een week over gedaan om in belgië geleverd te worden .
negative	van mijn 0 mails ( om_te checken waar het_boeket bleef ) werd slechts 0 beantwoord en toen ik telefonisch om een compensatie vroeg werd verontwaardigd gereageerd .
negative	uiteindelijk heb_ik_een upgrade van 0 euro gekregen .
negative	ik zal dan ook nooit meer beroep doen op dit bedrijf .
negative	purchased two pair of glasses , after 0 0 / 0_weeks finally received them ... however , the one pair was not the frame i ordered ... because i could not wait another 0 0 / 0_weeks for glasses that i needed to see with , i returned them and asked for refund .... 0 0 / 0_weeks after they received the wrong pair , i finally received a refund and they kept their return fee , and refunded only a portion of my money , even_tho they sent the wrong frame !!
negative	would not buy from them again !
negative	oh sure they have a number you can call .
negative	i called today and they hung_up on me twice and put the phone down when i tried to talk .
negative	it was a department in a foreign_country who couldn_'_t care less .
negative	they don_'_t take responsibilities for errors and blame the purchaser or the hotel .
negative	they don_'_t care about their purchasers just money .
negative	when i asked to speak to a supervisor she handed the phone to the person next to her .
negative	i know this because i recognized the voice .
negative	roll the dice and take your chances but i '_m done with them .
negative	had there been any other options available of the accessory i '_m buying i would not buy from yesstyle .
negative	it '_s been years since i stopped shopping at yesstyle simply because if your purchase does not reach 000 you '_ll have to pay for the stupid shipping .
negative	why should i pay for the goddamn shipping if it does not arrive until a month later ?
negative	you call them and a rude chinese uncle answers the phone .
negative	whatever !
negative	timing was good , parts were wrong .
negative	it took three attempts to get the order right :
negative	0 .).
negative	the order was sent to the wrong_address they sent it to the bill to - not the shipping address
negative	0 .)
negative	when part of the order was not available , they cancelled it .
negative	they did not ask if i wanted to add or substitute anything ; in fact , i was not even notified .
negative	i caught it myself
negative	0 .).
negative	now the order is sent in two parts - the first to arrive was incomplete and i have not been able to get any response at all
negative	i am a pretty reasonable person and would not write something unless it were truly horrible as this was .
negative	i hope they do better with other orders .
negative	i booked silver_shuttle for a round - trip transportation from heathrow to our hotel in london .
negative	i received the email_confirmation regarding the scheduled pick_up time two_nights before , i was intructed to turn on my phone upon landing for a text_message that would instruct me on where to meet our driver .
negative	i received no text .
negative	after walking around the terminal for 00_minutes , we contacted them by phone .
negative	we were told that due to heavy_traffic , our driver was 00_minutes away .
negative	mind you , they were already 00_minutes late .
negative	after waiting another 00_minutes , and still , receiving no call or text with an update , we called yet again .
negative	we were told the driver was just pulling into the airport and to continue waiting .
negative	after another 00 - 00_minutes , ( mind you , no call or text from them ), we called and asked to speak to a manager .
negative	we had already paid for the shuttle service , and taking a taxi would incur yet another additional_cost , not to mention , cost twice as much .
negative	we were transferred to simon , who explained he had been unaware of the problem ; however , was unable to reach the driver .
negative	after over 0 0 / 0 hours of waiting , we were forced to pay a taxi to take us to our hotel .
negative	i have never in my life dealt_with such an unproffessional shuttle company .
negative	please do not waste your time with them .
negative	left waiting at t0 for 00mins for collections of vehicle , approached twice by police to move car along .....
negative	when the car was collected your employee enquired and suggested to myself and work_colleague we should have travelled together in 0 car rather_than 0 !
negative	not his place and ultimately reducing the business profit of your company and service .
negative	0 car = 0 payment , 0 cars = 0 payments !!
negative	!
negative	upon_arrival we received a similar haphazard and inpolite service , left waiting for car delivery , when driver / car did arrive they went right past us and had to do another lap and several more phone_calls to direct your driver .
negative	only 0 car dropped at a time so i was left waiting for a further 00mins after my colleagues .
negative	overall a poor service received this time compared to other experiences when i have had only praise for the service .
negative	i booked my 0st anniversary cruise with travelocity .
negative	the same day i booked my cruise which was over 0000 . 00 the price of the cruise dropped .
negative	i did a customer guarantee which was supposed to take 00_hours .
neutral	one product to big for being a med .
neutral	and the color was not what was expected .
neutral	i really saved on costs for upcoming_trip to new_york for myself , grand_daughter and mother with dementia condition .
neutral	seats on ongoing flight were obtained with no problem .
neutral	flight is usairways .
neutral	there were many rows of available seating for the return flight available through american but operated by usairways , and although i selected seats my finalized itinerary showed the selection did not go through .
neutral	spending hours on the phone with travelocity , usairways and american has not resulted in seat_assignments .
neutral	american says usairways has to assign the seats .
neutral	usairways has no record of the reservation , though it shows up on american and travelocity records . separation will be difficult because of my mother '_s medical condition and no one is providing assistance .
neutral	quite a mess for me to resolve .
neutral	tour was relaxing and the weather was cooperative , yet i felt if it was just possible to pull up to one of the many show stopper '_s such as the children library , or chinese restaurant to have a meal or just to look would have been the ultimate tour .
neutral	i ordered a power plate on friday , it states next_day delivery , thinking it would arrive yesterday i waited around .
neutral	hopefully it will come today !
neutral	it was easy to navigate the shop and find good deals but it took weeks for two books to show up to my address .
neutral	if i had ordered a day or two later it would have messed_up a lot of events
neutral	it is beautiful but i expected my dress to be exactly as appear in the picture .
neutral	i only had to rent one book online , and my only option was bookbyte .
neutral	i had researched reviews and for the most part everything was good so i went with it .
neutral	the shipping time was good , but when i got my book i wasn_'_t too happy .
neutral	i knew that it would be a loose_leaf book , but when i received the package in the mail they had the book on a much smaller binder ring than what was needed and some of the pages were tore off from the front and back .
neutral	i would have been okay with this if the information hadn_'_t of said the book was in good shape .
neutral	the book wasn_'_t missing any pages so luckily i have everything i need for class , but i did have to go out and purchase some items to fix the book to be able to use it in class without losing pages .
neutral	i ordered a light fitting for undershelves in our study , i quoted the exact number on the fitting but when it arrived it was not compatible possibly having been modernised over the years .
neutral	on closer inspection of the site , there are items which state not compatible but this was not stated on my item .
neutral	i therefore returned it paying the postage and yet the postage was still deducted .
neutral	although it was returned eventually i felt if this happens everytime some customers may not bother claiming back the postage !
neutral	i would be reluctant to use the site again in view of what has happened to me .
neutral	the dresses were great but waiting ten days for online delivery at £ 0 . 00 was too long compared to other_sites which can do next_day or a few_days delivery for free .
neutral	it '_s made with a great material , but it doesn_'_t stay in place .
neutral	the liquids are okay , but for that price i can buy better liquids for a better price !
neutral	!
neutral	but i '_ve not received my package as of yet .. est delivery was to be 00 / 00 / 00 and still nothing ...
neutral	the date now is 00 / 00 / 00 ...
neutral	we were thinking priceline was the answer until they booked us a room at a hotel that had only smoking_rooms left !
neutral	so that leaves very mixed feelings cuz we '_ve done great with priceline .
neutral	nice hotels , good prices , but if there '_s anything i can '_t stand its a smoky room !
neutral	will think carefully before using priceline again
neutral	plus points - website is great and easy to navigate , customer_service ( when you get to speak to someone ) is excellent and on line contact is pretty good too in terms of follow_up .
neutral	delivery service dpd are excellent .
neutral	negative points - the delivery process seems very disorganised .
neutral	some things are very delayed in delivery or indeed do not arrive at all ( not a dpd problem if they are not receiving the goods ) i have cancelled a number of items because i was fed up with waiting for them and then noticed the site was running the same products again ( that did not make any sense )
neutral	returns are also delayed in terms of processing - an_email would be useful to say the returned goods have been received and then when the credit has_been applied to the account .
neutral	when i look at my account it states when some refunds have been applied but not always so i am forever having to follow things up with paypal or my credit_card to see the activity .
neutral	there doesn_'_t appear to be a consistent process that applies to all things .
neutral	sometimes the description of products is not very comprehensive and not enough pictures ( small issue )
neutral	i liked the idea of having my luggage shipped but when delivery went sideways the customer_service manager was robotic in her response .
neutral	no empathy and gave_me the company line " we are only responsible for delivering luggage from door to door and that is what we did ".
neutral	lets just say damaged luggage and messed_up delivery didn_'_t leave me feeling like using this service ever again .
neutral	got my petflow box o ' goodies , and glad i only paid the intro price !
neutral	did not value the items in the box as highly as you seemed , so don_'_t feel that a monthly repeating would be in my pocketbooks best interest !
neutral	boxes of cat_litter often have rips or holes with litter leaking out .
neutral	food bags are fine .
neutral	we also ordered the 00lb box of fresh step premium litter and were notified that it had been_discontinued .
neutral	the service was acceptable but the communication could have been better .
neutral	synes amazon er_en ganske fin hjemmeside , men jeg mener det_er_meget svært at finde ud_af hvilke sælgere der sender til dk og hvilke der_ikke gør .
neutral	jeg mener det_er problematisk at jeg først kan se om jeg overhovedet kan få tingene sendt_til mig når det_er jeg_er ved at betale .
neutral	derud over synes_jeg det_er svært at se hvor afsender kommer fra , dermed er_det svært at regne ud om man_skal betale told eller ej når tingene kommer_til dk

neutral	my order was cancelled because they did not have the book i needed .
neutral	which was a hassle because i needed the book asap and felt_like it would have been better had they said out of stock to begin with .
neutral	the service at first was very good but on a second application for funds there was nothing after chasing it up myself it was a problem with bank servers but i '_ve had no communication from the company itself or any updates as to when the problem will be fixed this has gone on for four days now not very good with keeping in touch with the customer
neutral	despite loving the glasses , it took over the 00 working day policy they offer ; and then once they turned_up a part was missing from the glasses .
neutral	i emailed straight_away to advise of this but mentioned i didnt want to return the glasses due to the long wait to actually receive them .
neutral	i wasn_'_t offered any other alternatives and therefore now have to live with broken glasses that apparently are thoroughly quality checked !!
neutral	!
neutral	despite this the service was good in terms of responding to my query its just a shame of the quality of the glasses i received ..
neutral	generally very helpful , just needed to know for sure right at that moment if i could get more than agent was stating i could get , for my emergency need , so had to end the call and get more info for myself .
neutral	needs to work on customer_service
neutral	i would give five_stars , but the constant changing of the shipping date estimates was incredibly frustrating .
neutral	i ' d_rather be told from the get - go that it will take more time to ship than to be strung along for longer and longer delays .
neutral	i paid for next_day postage but received the item on the st nod day .
neutral	called ckear chemist and was told that a refund would be applied . item condition arrived intact , friendly customer_service .
neutral	in theory delivery . com is awesome however they need to work out some kinks .
neutral	they dont confirm with the restaurants so if a place doesn_'_t receive your order , because they closed early or because of technical_issues you never know until they don_'_t show up .
neutral	this has happend to me twice and it '_s not fun to find out after an_hour of waiting that your food is not coming at all .
neutral	i do love that fact that you can earn_points and they offer great discounts so i keep using it but i also have some issues with the app .
neutral	i sometimes get frustrated and give up and use seamless . com or just pick_up the phone and order the old fashion way .
neutral	i said in 0 line
neutral	there shipping is to high on some of there stuff
neutral	i have been a customer for a long time now , love your deals but not happy with the false_advertisement i was sent by e_- mail for labor weekend a code for 00 per - cent off i put the code in several_times , i had a very large order .
neutral	it did nor work tried call na so i left a message on your vm no response back .
neutral	so i cut my order less_than half and did the labor day 00 coupon you had on you sight .
neutral	i would appreciated if you did not send me coupon_codes that don_'_t work !
neutral	very disappointed !
neutral	:(
neutral	ordered a wig , but because i have short hair , it was massive and i couldn_'_t keep it out of my eyes when i tried it on so it wasn_'_t possible to wear it .
neutral	disappointed when i contacted the company and was told that because i tried it on , they couldn_'_t take it back .
neutral	i don_'_t know how you can possibly tell from the picture if its going to fit .
neutral	it had been out of the bag for about 00 seconds .
neutral	will think_twice about ordering again in case something isn_'_t suitable .
neutral	i orderd a top from boohoo really quick delivery as i wanted it for a night out lovley top but had a hole returns process was easy but took over a week to be refunded that '_s after they had recieved the faulty item and checked it so all in all 0_weeks to be refunded .
neutral	i suppose this is the same all over but i don_'_t understand how they manage to take your money same day but can '_t refund as quickly !
neutral	overall service was good but quality of item was poor !
neutral	the price is right for tires here , but it is so difficult to not waste an entire day on tires .
neutral	they are always so crowded and you wait so long .
neutral	it is also a bit of a hassle having to bring the vehicle back after 00_miles when your car has over 000k miles .
neutral	i have never_heard this before and i have always used a dealer .
neutral	this particular time they had me in and out in 00_mins but i was only getting the tires_rotated and i had an_appointment that i had to make 0 0 / 0_weeks in advance .
neutral	clothes fit but aren_'_t as stretchy as review described but material is a bit uncomfortable against the skin , i will try washing .
neutral	.. i bought the wrong_size and the fee to post it back stopped me from re - ordering just in case i had to send that back as well ... freepost would be good : )
neutral	would have been perfect , but the picture i uploaded to put on the mug was so small it was ridiculous .
neutral	olisi hyvä , jos aurinkolaseista löytyisi tieto linssien
neutral	koosta , jotta voisi arvioida minkä kokoiset ne
neutral	olisivat kasvoilla .
neutral	säästyisi palautuksilta ja
neutral	pettymyksiltä .
neutral	i ordered 0 outfits ( all separates ) for my granddaughters , i asked them to be delivered to my daughters home in florida .
neutral	when i got my confirmation they had the address correct , but didn_'_t have her name , they did call me to take_care of that issue .
neutral	( her address is on us military base ), wasn_'_t sure she would get it w_/ my name on there .
neutral	i got confusing info .
neutral	when i tried to track the pkg , one place showed entire order was filled & another said one item was not in stock ( it would have been nice to have been able to order a different item to replace , but i was not given that option !)
neutral	my daughter received the pkg & said the items were nice & seemed of good quality , but i didn_'_t get to see them since i live in pennsylvania !
neutral	i looked up the hampton in morristown tn on the internet .
neutral	the only phone_number was your number , not a direct number to the establishment .
neutral	i asked for a king_bed , non_smoking_room .
neutral	i was quoted a price and asked for the aarp rate .
neutral	i told the reservation clerk i was coming down for a funeral , at no time did they quote a bereavement rate .
neutral	the next_day the confirmation was in my e_mail for a 0 bed non_smoking .
neutral	i called and was told that was all they had unless i wanted a king with a sofa pull out for a higher_rate .
neutral	when we arrived i was told if we had contacted the hotel_directly they could have negotiated a bereavement price .
neutral	they need to give better directions then to just say door 0 .
neutral	we wasted so much time at airport trying to find door 0 with our heavy_luggage and in the cold .
neutral	it was a nice thought to have our car running and warm when we got back but oh , they didn_'_t have the heater turned on !
neutral	wide_range and cheap prices .
neutral	you can tell that it isn_'_t the best quality , but i guess you can '_t expect that from such prices .
neutral	the sizes are pretty small , which is a bit odd since it says in the description of some of the clothes that they are slightly bigger_than usual .
neutral	i ' d say ignore that .
neutral	delivery was fast and overall it was an ok experience .
neutral	i ordered my contacts over a week_ago , i am still_waiting for them to arrive .
neutral	i don_'_t know if they had a problem sending my order , however ordered contacts 00 days ago .
neutral	ordered a new dishwasher on thursday_evening for delivery on sunday .
neutral	as_promised , received email on sunday_morning advising the time_slot , followed_up a couple of hours_later by a call from the delivery driver advising the delivery slot .
neutral	paid for the installation and disposal service - delivery driver did not have a screwdriver to hand ( he probably had one in the lorry !
neutral	), so that was not efficient , had to borrow one from us and on removal of old dishwasher and disposal left a long trail of water down the stairs of my flat - one of the two delivery people did not speak_english at all - greater care should be taken .
neutral	dishwasher was slightly wonky - when my husband pointed this out , he was told " it '_s ok ".
neutral	when they left my husband adjusted the feet of the washer and all is working fine at the moment .
neutral	so overall good experience with ao but delivery side requires improvement .
neutral	because of this i am only rating 0_stars for the experience , otherwise would give 0 .
neutral	i recently travelled to europe and needed to hire a 0 seater van to accommodate for all travellers and their luggage and the auto_europe website kept telling_me that there were vans available .
neutral	when confirming booking , and putting down security deposit , we are then advised that the vans are not available .
neutral	website should only provide a list of available vehicles .
neutral	i then had to book two cars but the cars that were provided turned_out to be from two_separate companies meaning that after a long flight i had to queue up at two different counters .
neutral	quite disappointed ;, having telephoned and followed with two requests via the web_site to return one faulty light , i have heard_nothing further .
neutral	sipgate ist_für voip ganz gut , allerdings ist die_qualität nicht so toll , auch gibt_es immer mal wieder ausfälle oder man hört sich selbst beim telefonieren .
neutral	der_preis ist_für 00 . 00 € für ganz eu ok , allerdings kostet das bei meinem kabel anbieter sogar monatlich nur 0 . 00 €, weshalb ich vermutlich auch kündigen werde .
neutral	das handyapp für android funktioniert fast garnicht , was ich schlecht finde , da man das gut gebrauchen kann unterwegs für festnetzanrufe .
neutral	0 von 0 sternen , weil der_preis ok ist_und man sipgate überall nutzen kann wenn_man z . b ein laptop hat und_die sipgate telefonsoftware downloadet , unabhängig wo man gerade im urlaub ist .
neutral	( habe es oft in costa_rica , peru und argentinien benutzt und ab einer dsl leitung von 0000 läuft auch_die verbindung der gespräche flüssig )
neutral	bei ebay findet man tolle schnäppchen , leider ist ebay nur noch zum kaufen empfählenswert , durch die hohen kosten die ein verkäufer hat lohnt es sich fast nicht_mehr etwas anzubieten da man einstellgebühren bezahlt + 0 % vom gewinn abgeben muss , wenn_man als verkäufer paypal anbietet sind es sogar 00 , 0 %+ 00 cent .
neutral	das ebay gebühren von verkäufer nimmt finde_ich etwas dreist , der einzige käuferschutz , den man bei ebay wirklich hat ist paypal und durch den hohen betrag bieten immer weniger verkäufer diese option an , so dass bei einem betrug leider nichts mehr helfen kann .
neutral	zwar kann_man bei ebay auf " problem klären " klicken , jedoch bekommt man dann nach einer gewissen zeit die antwort , das ebay nicht helfen kann , weil nicht über paypal bezahlt wurde .
neutral	fazit : da ebay immer teurere gebühren anbietet , werden auch_die preise bei ebay teurer von den verkäufern , was schnäppchen nur noch selten macht , aufgrund der hohen paypal kosten , bieten immer weniger verkäufer diese option an und damit ist_auch keine sicherheit mehr beim einkauf gegeben .
neutral	daher nur 0 von 0 sternen .
neutral	ich_habe zum ersten mal bei dell was bestellt_und_bin recht zufrieden , leider bekommt man kaum treiberupdates für seine geräte und_auch der download ist ziemlich problematisch .
neutral	abwohl ich ein dell pc habe funktioniert der dell downloader nicht , dagegen aber die iso variante oder direktdownload .
neutral	der support ist_sehr hilfsbereit und wenn es wirklich mal eng wird , kann dell sogr auf_den pc ( ähnlich wie mit teamviewer ) und so das problem vielleicht beseitigen .
neutral	ich_habe bei dell einen xps 00 mit 0d brille und grafikkarte + bildschirm gekauft , der laptop ist super , die 0d funktion allerdings nicht sehr .
neutral	bestellt hatte_ich ein nvidia 0d kit das den sensor separat dabei hatte , bei dem ansich nämlich auch " duke nukem " kostenlos dabei sein sollte von nvidia , leider bekam ich nur die brille geliefert die für den preis überteuert war , da die brille einzeln nur 00 € kostet und hingegen das komplette kit 000 €.
neutral	auch scheint die 0d funktion nicht ganz richtig zu sein , wenn_man anvisiert kann_man nie die mitte treffen , man muss mit_dem kurser ziemlich nach links oder rechts gehen .
neutral	ich vergebe dell deshalb nur 0 von 0 sternen .
neutral	man_bekommt bei pearl als kunde sehr oft kostenlose angebote , leider muss man auch bei geschenken 0 € versand bezahlen , unabhängig vom gewicht .
neutral	oft sind die gratis geschenke minderwertig , gehen schnell kaputt oder funktionieren erst garnicht .
neutral	bei einem gratis geschenk , bekam ich sogar einen virus , weil die treiber vom hersteller verseucht waren und dieser deswegen vom markt genommen wurde , leider habe_ich das zu spät bei google gelesen als_ich nach guten treibern suchte .
neutral	als_ich dies dem support mitteilte , kam keine reaktion .
neutral	auch gibt_es erst bei_einer ziemlich hohen summe " kostenlose lieferung ", wo viele ab 00 € schon kostenlos anbieten .
neutral	der_versand dauert je nach bestellung bis zu 0 - 0 wochen und kommt voll gefüllt mit werbung .
neutral	the oxygen_sensor was the wrong piece . the inside par fit but not the outside .
neutral	i ordered 00 items of which 0 where backordered .
neutral	yesterday i recieved the 0 first and they were as specified , but the packaging must be very low quality - it was a cardboard_box , of which one of the sides were completely split_open .
neutral	pure luck none of the heavy schampoo bottles hadn_'_t slipped out !
neutral	also , you don_'_t get a shipping order any more , only vouchers for shops that does not have business in my country ( this is a very minor_issue , but shows clearly they don_'_t even check where the package is going - i don_'_t live in the uk but get a load of discount_vouchers for sainsbury '_s and a wine company .
neutral	it annoys me ).
neutral	i was disappointed when i called for an early reorder due to spilling more than half the medicine on the floor due to the stopper coming out when i pulled the syringe out with the bottle still upside_down .
neutral	then i had to go to my vet and get generic prednisolone liquid in pre_- filled syringes ( not my first choice for quality ), to cover the time it took to ship the next bottle 0 days !!
neutral	!
neutral	their should be instructions which notify you that the stopper is not fixed in the bottle but can be pulled out accidentally when withdrawing the syringe filled with medicine .
neutral	the instruction should advise the person to turn the bottle parallel to the floor before pulling out the syringe and to hold the stopper in with a clean tissue when doing so .
neutral	not happy here .
neutral	.
neutral	i was sent an_email after i placed my order that informed me i couldn_'_t drop ship my car parts to my auto repair_shop .
neutral	the parts were going to be sent to the billing_address on my credit_card , which is a shopping center where my husband has an office and he is rarely there .
neutral	i couldn_'_t reply to the email and was disconnected every time i placed a call to partsgeek .
neutral	i had a lot of angst as my only option was to complete a service ticket and hope that i was available when i was contacted by them .
neutral	i received my order accurately and quickly after i was finally able to get a person to call me from partsgeek .
neutral	the customer_service representative handled my problem very efficiently .
neutral	so , other than the few_days that it took to correct my shipment address , everything was fine !
neutral	i am exstreamly pleased with the jacket a bought from superdry , however returning products that didn_'_t fit were expensive
neutral	some of the deals i '_ve received through_travelocity are unmatched .
neutral	however , dealing_with customer_service is enough to make me shop elsewhere .
neutral	no on explained why they mounted my tires in the rear instead of the front .
neutral	even my husband was surprised !
neutral	now i have to make another trip or phone_call to get an explanation .
neutral	my suggestion , if you are going to print out what service you will perform , you need to explain to the customer fully to avoid misunderstanding later .
neutral	well , it '_s interesting and i guess it will work .
neutral	i have a few issues with it however .
neutral	0st - the " units " are a little on the big size , i think too big for the game .
neutral	0nd - having to cut each and every " unit " out instead of them being_able
neutral	to pop out .
neutral	i received an_email_confirming that my mum had received her flowers , yet a phone_call revealed that she had not received any flowers .
neutral	a reply to the confirmation_email resulted in a reply that stated the flowers were left on the front_porch .
neutral	although mother '_s sunday may be a very busy day , a simple ring of the doorbell or a card through the mail slot would have alerted mum that she had received flowers .
neutral	poor mum spent the day thinking we had forgotten her !
neutral	very disappointing ...
neutral	travelocity has always been fantastic to me .
neutral	however , this past trip was a big_disappointment .
neutral	my son got sick so i had to cancel the last day of the hotel , which i did a full 00_hours before .
neutral	i was promised a refund , but now they won_'_t even return my e_- mail .
neutral	something has apparently happend in their customer_service , to their ( and my detriment .)
neutral	well i was happy to find a place that would purchase my books but i was very dissapointed in the amounts that are offered for them .
neutral	and i have a whole closet of books to sell but eaglesaver only bought a quarter of what i wanted to sell .
neutral	so i still have a bunch of books im stuck with .
neutral	i will not be using eaglesaver again .
neutral	i got the trademark i requested , but i '_ve called and emailed them several_times and they never responded .
neutral	pleased that our order arrived right on time with accurate contents ; however , as other_reviewers have noted , part of the order ( canned_cat_food ) arrived damaged .
neutral	several of the cans were badly dented - it sounds like pet_flow needs to improve its packaging .
neutral	otherwise , very convenient !
neutral	i love that you can sign_up for automatic delivery with a frequency that suits your needs .
neutral	please improve the way you pack your orders , pet_flow , and we will_continue to buy !
neutral	i was able to find the exact pet_food that our vet recommended , however , your website failed when it came to asking me how often i wanted to automatically have the food shipped .
neutral	it seemed to have a glitch and so i had to e_- mail customer_service to be sure that my order was only for one shipment , not multiple .
neutral	other than that , the food is exactly_what the vet ordered for our dog .
neutral	don_'_t know how long he '_ll need to be on this type which is why we didn_'_t want multiple shipments .
neutral	i recently had to purchase different dog_food as my pet was not eating good ... in the meantime i recieved another order from petflow upon contacting them as to what to do with this shipment it has_been four days and i have still heard_nothing ... today they sent me this survey ... and no answer to my problem ... so this is my opinion ... during my business with petflow ... i found it difficult to change orders because in doing so , you cancel out your next order and need to wait for the one after that ... i was always running_out of food , and had to go to the store which is quite a distance from my house ... that '_s why i went to petflow , however , sometimes it was a convenience and sometimes it was a hassle ...
neutral	i found this by_accident and fell in love , the prices are great but , one day i received an_email for some dog_food half off , so i placed a big order and was so exceited how much i got and how much money i saved .
neutral	well i waited two_days for a tracking_number and finally called to see what was going on .
neutral	i got a rep . on the phone that told me the food was on back order and 0 of the other 0 items were discontinued so i couldnt even get them .
neutral	i was frustrated why the website said that they had plenty in and i didnt get anything and then they wouldnt honor sale because it was out of stock .
neutral	i thought i would give them another try and ordered two more orders and they were both great prices and shipping was great timing but still same thing some of the stuff i ordered that said available it wasnt .
neutral	if i shop again im just not gonna order anything with a small quanity left .
neutral	other than that my animals loved the stuff .
neutral	i had to book tickets for my family who were visiting overseas because online bookings did not accept international credit_card bookings .
neutral	however , after purchasing the tickets for my family using my uk card my family had to take my credit_card for the day because the operators required the actual credit_card before they will issue the ticket .
neutral	changes to make the system easier for international visitors would have made the experience much more enjoyable .
neutral	the tour itself is very good but it was let_down on this occasion by the tour_guide .
neutral	i am a londoner and had taken a visiting relative on the tour & was mortified sitting next to a gay couple from new_york having to listen to various homophobic jokes from the elderly tour_guide .
neutral	some of the commentary was also simply wrong .
neutral	i don_'_t know if parts are correct ones , until i go to install them .
neutral	the part numbers given on the boxs do not match the part numbers given on the website page .
neutral	my flight was canceled but did not receive the email until was already at connecting airport , email was supposedly sent 0 hours earlier .
neutral	at connecting airport , they didn_'_t pay for hotel in the area & i was forced to stay in airport overnight until i could be put on an early_morning flight to another city not originally_planned for .
neutral	i am really grateful to the airline worker at springfield airport , wyatt , who made it possible for me to even get on a flight though .
neutral	it '_s nice and easy to order , the free_shipping is awesome , but the actual clothes were much_cheaper quality than i expected .
neutral	cheap flights and cheap cars to rent do not necessarily mean a good experience organizing your travels , but as i say , you get what you pay for .
neutral	your shipping time estimate is way off .
neutral	my books were 0 days late for my class .
neutral	whilst the service was prompt , the product well_packaged and priced , sadly it is not reliable .
neutral	the adhesion to clothing is good but the absorbant top layer material detaches from the adhesive base and disintergrates after only a couple of hours of wear making the product ineffective .
neutral	a shame .
neutral	i wouldn_'_t buy this brand again .
neutral	the shopping was good , many things in my size ( small or extra small ) the prices and deals were great !
neutral	shipping was like any other , not super_fast though .
neutral	but i am disappointed that one of my items were out of stock , i ' d_rather you restock things and send it to me later rather_than get a free ring , but i understand if you dont restock .
neutral	also some of the clothes seemed cheap .
neutral	the buttons were near to falling_off , and on a different shirt one of the buttons were completely unaligned .
neutral	also the tags on one of the shirts were cut_off ...?
neutral	overall it was decent , your products were appealing but the quality was a bit under the bar , but at a price so cheap it was worth it .
neutral	thank_you for the clothes
neutral	my initial order with ni_parcels went without hitch .
neutral	0nd time was a different matter and was without a doubt one of the most stressful experiences with a courier service .
neutral	as a small business_owner , i do not have time to chase up tasks which i have allocated and paid someone_else to do .
neutral	nor do i need a lecture on running a business which doesn_'_t collect customer phone numbers .
neutral	excessive use of " i can only apologise " negates the apology and makes matters worse .
neutral	i don_'_t want words i want actions which are going to correct the error .
neutral	that said i have used the service for a third time as i think everyone deserves the chance to improve on their service .
neutral	still_waiting for that parcel to be delivered so can '_t comment on the outcome .
neutral	it did not give us the option to change shipping address .
neutral	so the book came to my house and i had to send it to my daughter at her college .
neutral	she still does not have it .
neutral	i love the option to create your own gift_cards .
neutral	i own a wedding business and as brides refer me to other brides i send them a gift_card and personalize it with a photo of their bouquet .
neutral	but shipping takes way too long and is not consistent .
neutral	i ordered two gift_cards on one day , shipped them to the same town .
neutral	one bride got hers in days , the second has not been delivered yet and it has_been three_weeks !
neutral	as above .
neutral	i now have no money !
neutral	!
neutral	shipping takes foreverrrrrrr
neutral	in my experience with dealing_with potential new customers , i '_ve come to find out that if you have the right people in place who are following the right process , you will undoubtedly be able to serve the best product .
neutral	with swift capital , it seemed like they had the right people in place but they all seemed to be following a different process which led to a frustrating experience when it came to just wanting the product .
neutral	back and forth on the same topic until finally an experienced person completely understood the situation and in the end was able to deliver the product .
neutral	that '_s why if i '_m being honest , the rating is so - so - acceptable experience but with some friction .
neutral	i couldn_'_t have asked for better service from any of the people that work with us friendly answered any question we had .
neutral	but it was such a long day got there at 00am finally finished at 0pm we checked the car we bought from one end the other no_problems till i drove 0 nights later first time to be driving the new car at night time i had daytime running lights and bright lights on the car during the day you would have thought the lights worked to looked at them during the checklist i got pulled over trying to get back home for using the bright lights to make it home thank_god the cop understood and didn_'_t give me a ticket went by the dealer i got the car from and they said they would see what they could do for me i will call you back never we talked a few_times but no answer other then he was waiting for someone to get out of a meeting i waited till noon the next_day with still not a call back so i called and they said the person i needed to talk to was gone for the day that was 0 hours into business that day here is a week_later and no one has bothered calling me at all so sad they sold me a car then they didn_'_t care about nothing sad thing is that within two_days of getting this car i had already sent someone that bought a car from them so that makes me feel_like they just wanted my money and me to send business to them but they don_'_t want to make me happy and coming_back sad they got me in with kindness and then treated me like trash thats how it made me feel i went to the vw dealership down the road and talked with them about fixing the lights and they said it was an easy mistake that they have run_into before and they quoted me a price i am taking it to them already having to poor money into a 0000 that i shouldn_'_t have too
neutral	i was in arms about the process , certain that i was scammed , but just an_hour ago my necklace arrived .. the company had agreed to reimburse_me for the item but they do not need to now .
neutral	i got it and am satisfied with the quality for what i paid .
neutral	i feel bad for saying they were a scam .
neutral	clearly they do produce these items .
neutral	i do believe they should not rely_on the usps with no tracking for their shipping .
neutral	it is not a good plan and has left many shoppers stressed .
neutral	i had some issues contacting the company with a problem in my order .
neutral	i received an_email alerting me of the problem and asking me to respond yet no one responded to my requested email .
neutral	that was disappointing and an inconvenience , but the product was good and i '_m glad i bought it .
neutral	bought a six month pack of antihistamines at end of may ' 00 with a groupon_voucher .
neutral	delivery very prompt , but use - by date on antihistamine boxes was december ' 00 , so not very impressive considering they were manufactured in january ' 00 !
neutral	awesome service .
neutral	too many ads though .
neutral	some privacy concerns too .
neutral	pure_formulas has a wide_variety of the products i use but lately shipping has_been very slow , even when paying for priority shipping it is slow .
neutral	very disappointed in delivery_men they wouldn_'_t put furniture in its place we couldn_'_t move them ourselfs ... wardrobes were 0 heavy .. we bought from urselfs for ease cos they were ready built ...
neutral	very annoyed
neutral	breakfast good room cold took all night to warm up the room
neutral	overall we ' re very happy with the service from driveaway .
neutral	we '_ve used your company for many years_now with good results .
neutral	however we bring it to your attention the lack of service at hertz heathrow_airport this time .
neutral	after waiting a considerable time at pick_up we were told that a vauxall astra wasn_'_t available & we would have to accept a model two levels down on the one we ordered , with £_00 compensation .
neutral	as we were renting the car for a month this was unacceptable .
neutral	they then suggested we take the car for a week & return it for the correct one , which was silly in the extreme .
neutral	after standing our ground for 00_min hertz magically came up with the next category car .
neutral	we were not the only people in this position but having the time to be stubborn meant we finally got a reasonable car .
neutral	this is not really a complaint about your company but we thought you should be aware of the problem for future negotiations with hertz .
neutral	yours ,
neutral	patricia bendall
neutral	the car and the service were great !
neutral	very helpful for a foreigner that neglected to brush up on the language before traveling !
neutral	however , i checked off that i needed a gps device and there were none available , and the only car available with gps was way out of my price range .
neutral	so , the girl google mapped directions and printed it out for me and gave_me several maps .
neutral	it was fantastic customer_service , but after getting severely lost , i ended_up spending about $_000 in roaming charges by using the navigation on my cell_phone ... so that sucked !
neutral	thankfully , i arrived at my destination just in time to keep on schedule .
neutral	the car they gave_me was brand_new , not much horse power , but didn_'_t really need it , and i could make it perform if i needed to accelerate quick at merges .
neutral	i was very happy with the car and the service overall .
neutral	hello , i originally ordered three items , and to date have only received two .
neutral	i am missing my screen protectors for the ipad0 .
neutral	what could have been a good experience as been dampened by the lack of communication on the delay ...
neutral	please advise !
neutral	the things that wowcher offers are really good .
neutral	i have also bought over 0 items from wowcher , however i can '_t help but notice that wowcher sometimes tries to be sneaky about their things .
neutral	i just purchased a night hotel for 0 persons .
neutral	i bought this because the pictures of the rooms that were displayed with the wowcher deal were very very nice .
neutral	i bought the wocher and then i noticed that the pictures that were presented in the advertisment , were from rooms that you could not book with your wocher .
neutral	i wouldn_'_t call it false_advertising , but i do believe it is very missleading .
neutral	all the other rooms are a bit crap in comparison to that one .
neutral	next i bought the driverslessons .
neutral	it was very unclear that you couldnt use these lessons if youre experienced .
neutral	and third , i bought myself a handbag , and now , 0 months later , i still_haven_'_t received this item .
neutral	i was very pleased with the ease of ordering and quickness of shipping and arrival of order .
neutral	however , when my daughter tried on the gloves i ordered , a seam ripped when she tried to remove it .
neutral	she admits that she may have pulled too hard , but the manufacturer should know that people are going to do that and sew seams accordingly .
neutral	received my order promptly , but the yellow ink cartrudge i ordered didn_'_t feed , so am back to square one .
neutral	these lights arrived within 0 days and looked a very good quality .
neutral	pleased so_far .
neutral	charged them over 0 days in full sunshine ( 00hrs in all ) but only 0 out of 0 lit_up .
neutral	tried again the next_day to charge them up but to no_avail so have returned them in the hope of a refund .
neutral	shame as they were really nice lights .
neutral	wont bother again .
neutral	we have been searching for a digital_piano for sometime and finally found the perfect instrument .
neutral	this is our second digital_piano and even_though we thought our other piano was brilliant , this one leaves it standing .
neutral	i paid £_000 more than i wished to get it delivered on time and for the added_bonus of what looked like superior quality ear phones .
neutral	very dissapointed in the earphones which not only do not work , the conections / wiring is faulty ??
neutral	and they are available on ebay for £ 0 . 00 .
neutral	hugely dissapointed by this misleading advertising .
neutral	goods arrived next_day .
neutral	unfortunately one item was missing - no paperwork arrived in package .
neutral	had to telephone to find out where missing item was - was informed that they did not have item in stock and would be posting out as soon as it became available .
neutral	would have been good to email this information to me , or , to include documentation inside the package to confirm this .
neutral	sometimes i will get lucky and get a driver / office attendant that is friendly but most of the time the workers look and act miserable .
neutral	not the best greeting before or after a trip .
neutral	also , the most_recent time i used nltp the driver did not even offer to assist with my suitcase so i carried my medium suitcase on and off the shuttle_bus .
neutral	the good thing is i haven_'_t had to wait for a shuttle for long .
neutral	sadly the delivery was awful !
neutral	my package went all around the granby before it arrived at the delivery address - was supposed to go to my partner at his work , dorset auto spares , but went to about 0 other addresses before it got to him !!
neutral	dont understand_why because ive ordered from them before and there was no problem delivery wise that time .
neutral	some of products were made very cheaply .
neutral	i purchased puppy_pads and when the dog uses them one time they go through and get my floor soak n wet .
neutral	very cheaply_made for price .
neutral	i think that web - site must be updated .
neutral	no personl cabinet , serach isn ` t so convinient
neutral	box of stuff was collected at the door which is a bonus as already selling for peanuts , but as stuff was unwanted anyway it cleared_up a space in the cupboards and don_'_t have time to ebay stuff .
neutral	takes a few_weeks to actually get the money in but have got it eventually , so all in all wasn_'_t a bad_experience .
neutral	i am not sure i would use this service again .
neutral	way too much time between ordering the cards and delivery of the cards .
neutral	karen
neutral	i was pleased to see that i could_afford to get my dogs ' food delivered to our home .
neutral	however , it looked as though they marked the item for shipping ( which provided an eta ) nearly immediately .
neutral	sounds great , but the issue was that the package wasn_'_t actually handed off to fedex until the very day it was stated to arrive .
neutral	this made tracking & being home to receive the delivery a challenge & quite annoying .
neutral	i '_m a first time buyer through this site & do not know if i will be purchasing again .
neutral	i like petflow '_s fast shipping .
neutral	it is very convenient .
neutral	when i order cat_litter , which i typically do for all orders , every time i open the shipping box , litter is spilled out because its box was torn .
neutral	from the outside , the shipping box looks good .
neutral	i don_'_t know what to think , except a lot of cat_litter gets wasted and ends_up making a mess .
neutral	i have since learned to be cautious when opening the box , but i still lose litter and make some kind of mess .
neutral	please package the litter better .
neutral	i am paying for a full , intact box of cat_litter .
neutral	also , the golf ball size light up ball is my cat '_s favorite .
neutral	the problem is the ball is so small it rolls under everything .
neutral	i usually can find it after a search with the flashlight , but it has_been missing for a few_weeks .
neutral	are you able to offer a larger light up ball ?
neutral	my cat and i would appreciate it .
neutral	flowers sent to my mother in law as a thank_you .
neutral	when i saw them later that day , personally as the person paying for them , i was a little disappointed .
neutral	it '_s nice to have them delivered to the door , but could have bought better and cheaper from the supermarket .
neutral	i ordered a large pillow to winterize my pool .
neutral	it arrived_promptly as_promised and we took it out of the package the next weekend when we closed the pool .
neutral	as we were filling it up with air , we noticed that there was a large slice in it -- as if it was cut with a knife or box cutter .
neutral	since we were in the middle of the pool closing process , i ran_out to the nearest pool store to buy a replacement .
neutral	i then followed the instructions for returning the product and requested a refund instead of a replacement since i had already bought another .
neutral	two_days_later , a box appeared on my doorstep and doheny '_s water warehouse had sent a replacement product .
neutral	no_longer need it , but i guess it is better_than nothing .
neutral	i had to pay over $_00 in shipping to send it back too .
neutral	next time i will not buy inflatables thru the mail in case there is a problem .
neutral	bag looks like no name and was broken .
neutral	customer_service wants just money .
neutral	nothing special for me .
neutral	i went online and read some reviews about the super 0 in plattsburgh .
neutral	i was not expecting much from what some of the reviews said .
neutral	i was pleasantly_surprised with all_aspects of my stay .
neutral	the room was very clean .
neutral	all the linens were clean , the bed was very comfortable .
neutral	the area was quiet and conveniently_located 0 downtown plattsburgh and the shopping area .
neutral	the staff was very nice and helpful .
neutral	the price was very affordable .
neutral	i would definitely stay again .
neutral	as i stated above , i had to return an item , it did not weigh very much , but it cost me $ 0 . 00 , and the item only cost $_00 . 00 .
neutral	what a rip , you should have free return shipping .
neutral	information_regarding contact with the vets_office provided to me was incorrect .
neutral	great quality , fantastic value for money .
neutral	i live in a very rural location and share the postcode with many farms in the area , so my parcel went to a different farm !
neutral	it was lucky that the other farm knew me so i could collect my parcel !
neutral	i would like to see more coupons that work on your entire order not limited to certain brands .
neutral	that is what kept me coming to pureformulas now i shop the best deal & look for coupons & order the cheapest price because most of us do not have extra money to blow .
neutral	amazon offers less prices among other_sites , you use to be the best .
neutral	thanks for listening !
neutral	we were looking for a cheap hotel .
neutral	we got it .
neutral	sheets were clean .
neutral	the tub was clean .
neutral	the bathroom floor had hair on it .
neutral	the bed martress was way to hard .
neutral	i could feel every spring .
neutral	the building itself looked horrible .
neutral	the locks on the doors did not make me feel_safe . i would not walk in bare feet had to have something on .
neutral	the hotel was quiet which was a surprise !
neutral	a welcome surprise .
neutral	my dog_loves the food , however the delivery truck has delivered the last 0 times to the incorrect_address .
neutral	unfortunately both_times animals have chewed into the package to get the dog_food .
neutral	other than that , the food is great .
neutral	i ordered on - line .
neutral	somehow the order got lost .
neutral	i called - the person told me the order somehow got overlooked .
neutral	delivery came 0 days_later and we were very close to no food for our dog .
neutral	we decided to use priceline for the first time on our vacation to save some money .
neutral	i was happy with the price we got but very disappointed that we could not set specific qualifications for rooms , etc .
neutral	we used it three_times ( three different hotels ) and each time had trouble with the room ( bed type , smoking / non_smoking ).
neutral	in two situations the specific hotels told us that there were rooms available in the type we wanted but we were told ( even after pushing the issue ) that the hotels were not allowed / able to change the type of room .
neutral	my husband had to end up sleeping on the floor .
neutral	if this is the normal case , i wish there was a place on priceline where you could put in some qualifications like certain types of rooms , non_- smoking , number of guests , etc so that you could be sure to get something that fits your needs .
neutral	because of these problems , we will think_twice about using priceline in the future .
neutral	we had reserved an automatic and got a lovely upgrade to a terrific volvo : we loved our car .
neutral	everything went_smoothly at pick - up and drop - off , including a last - minute change of drop - off location .
neutral	our car was economical on fuel ( diesel ), roomy and comfortable , easy to maneuver on the narrow streets of ancient towns .
neutral	the europcar personnel were all competent , knowledgeable , and charming .
neutral	i ' d rate five_stars except for the safety issues involved in not having a spare + compressor , especially as we were traveling in an area with difficult road conditions .
neutral	this is the 0nd time i purchase a personalized card on this site .
neutral	i like the insurance of delivery and the time of the first one .
neutral	well the second time was not a pleasure ... don_'_t like the way they handled rejecting my pic on the card ...
neutral	i wanted to personalize the gift_cards to match a gingerbread theme for christmas wrapping_paper and gift bags and to make the gift special for each kid .
neutral	however , it wouldn_'_t let_me resize or enlarge each photo and the picture turned_out fuzzy .
neutral	also , the personalized_greeting_card fee was too high for what i could do with it .
neutral	if the personalized_greeting_card fee was included , i would have purchased more gift_cards .
neutral	macy '_s personalized_gift_cards include the free personalized_greeting_card and delivery .
neutral	the personalization program wasn_'_t easy to work with but at_least i was able to get the results i wanted .
neutral	when your adds said part is for left and right customer should receive left and right when place the order , not just one . unless it said left or right
neutral	i have ordered from petflow before and was always very happy with the service .
neutral	the only difference this time was that i moved and changed my address in your system but the delivery still went to the old address .
neutral	the prices are great .
neutral	the shipping is a little_longer_than i would like but i '_ve ordered on numerous_occasions and had great experiences .
neutral	i stumbled_upon sparefoot when i was searching online for a local storage_unit .
neutral	the website is clean and organized .
neutral	i found a facility i was interested in and called the number listed .
neutral	at this number i spoke to a sparefoot representative who took my information down and made a " reservation " to hold a 0 ' x 00 ' unit .
neutral	they sent a confirmation_email , including the phone_number for the actual facility .
neutral	i then called the facility directly to ask some further questions and was told they did not have any 0 ' x 00 ' units available , and did not understand_why we were told that they did .
neutral	i ended_up going back to my search_engine and found a different storage_facility on my own and am very happy with them .
neutral	my friend and i booked a room at the hotel .
neutral	she went through_expedia , i went straight to the site .
neutral	the room rate was the same , so i preceded .
neutral	after i confirmed and received the total with tax and fees , i paid $_00 more than she did .
neutral	we booked the same room type and within 00_minutes of each other .
neutral	i didn_'_t get a break_down of tax and fees so i don_'_t know where the increase is .
neutral	disappointed i didn_'_t get the same deal for the same product .
neutral	it would be great if you had more restaurants signed_up ... and if you followed_up with restaurants a bit better .
neutral	( i '_ve made a few orders that have then been cancelled because the place closed between when my order was sent and the place closed .)
neutral	but , i do really like the service .
neutral	the basically weekly discounts are great , they definitely make me more likely to use delivery . com more frequently than grubhub or eat00 , despite preferring those websites .
neutral	why does our small purchase come in such a big box ?
neutral	i would think a smaller box , which would be adequate for our purchase , would be less_expensive to ship .
neutral	we did not get to see what we wanted .
neutral	we had to ask the bus drivers about the itinerary of each bus , and ended_up on the same path 0x before getting directions from the coordinator at one of the stations about where to get off and what bus to catch next .
neutral	it was confusing .
neutral	probably would not use this bus service again .
neutral	i ordered 0 cards ; delivery was to 0 different_addresses .
neutral	i only received shipping confirmation with a tracking_number for 0 of the cards .
neutral	when i called the automated customer_service line to verify shipment of the other 0 cards , the service indicated that my order had been shipped in may of 0000 !!
neutral	i did speak to a representative who was able to confirm that all of my cards had shipped - but he never offered to forward me tracking_numbers .
neutral	also , when i told him about the response i received through the automated line , he just said " yeah , that '_s been happening ."
neutral	there was no effort at any point to say , " we ' re aware of that issue and are resolving it ," or " sorry you didn_'_t get shipment confirmation for the other 0 cards , we '_ll resolve that issue ," or even an offer to send me an_email with the tracking_numbers for the other 0 shipments .
neutral	really disappointed in this service .
neutral	will only use it again next year if i am desperate .
neutral	i '_m giving them 0_stars only because all of the cards were delivered on time .
neutral	while the straighteners were cheap and work ok , the casing looks like it has_been chewed by something and the spring cover was lying in the box broken .
neutral	tried to contact funtica by their " contact page " but it will not send .
neutral	when ordering our new rangemaster gas cooking range we took_advantage of the special_offer of a free rangecookers own branded extractor hood to go with it .
neutral	in reality it '_s not free as the price of the cooker was a few_hundred_pounds more_expensive than other online_retailers , however it still appeared to be a good deal .
neutral	the online ordering and delivery service was first_class and faultless for both items .
neutral	the rangemaster cooker is fantastic and was commiissioned by our experienced fitter with no_problems .
neutral	my issue is with the quality of the so called complimentary hood .
neutral	the fitting_instructions were poor and extremely vague , but more_importantly not all the required parts were supplied in order for it to be set_up and run in re circulation mode , in particularly the charcoal filters .
neutral	i find this completely unsatisfactory for rangecookers to knowingly supply new equipment that is not fit for purpose due to being incomplete .
neutral	i would not recommend anyone to buy one of rangecookers own branded extractor hoods .
neutral	not had part of my last order delivered yet so not a happy customer at the moment , first time i have had any bother with highland_titles .
neutral	i shop_here often and it is rare to get anything that is sized right and doesn_'_t look cheap .
neutral	now i do like the clothes but they are never as they appear on the site .
neutral	pants run small and shirts tend to run a bit large in my experience .
neutral	i would not recommend the sweat pants at all , and sweaters are going to be thin .
neutral	anything with rhinestones i don_'_t recommend either .
neutral	attachments on shoes like flowers may fall off , but if you have a hot glue gun ..... also the jewelry is just horribly cheaply_made , so ... just as long as you know what to buy you are ok .
neutral	i will say i have been waiting for more than a week on my last order , and when i accidentally added two of the same sweaters to my cart rather_than calling or emailing to be sure it was not a mistake they sent it and told me my mistake my shipping problem , so ... yeah , that was more than a 000 dollar order , and i had 0 others on the way , so i felt a bit unappreciated .
neutral	i hope it was not lost or stolen , because they are not responsible for that either evidently .
neutral	product looks amazing on line .
neutral	i am still_waiting to hear from the futon_shop about when product was shipped & when it is estimated to arrive .
neutral	i also did not receive a confirmation of my order .
neutral	still hopeful it will come .
neutral	this site would be better if it listed everything according to the time it was posted , rather_than making you choose the option .
neutral	i always end up loosing where i was at in the search process .
neutral	i also don_'_t like the sponsored jobs at the top and bottom of the page .
neutral	it '_s distracting .
neutral	once a week should be adequate to find events of interest .
neutral	also , might have a method for targeting types of interests of member ( e . g .
neutral	no jazz , but theater ).
neutral	also , i will never buy a ticket at a large venue like the ahmanson .
neutral	the ticketing method allows theaters to sell a huge section for the same price .
neutral	e . g .
neutral	" orchestra " can be from 0st row to last row .
neutral	how can i know i won_'_t be in the last row ?
neutral	i will be able to give a better answer .. after i see them help me look for work .
neutral	not really happy cos none of the three wheel trims could be put back as they were .
neutral	tyres were replaced satisfactorily though
neutral	i ordered 0 different parts which came from three different_warehouses .
neutral	i had to pay three different shipping prices which was a huge con .
neutral	fortunately , one part arrived the very next_day !
neutral	however , my two other parts were a different story .
neutral	i had been tracking my package and found that it was delivered on a monday and signed for by somebody that i did not know .
neutral	i went home to found that my package was not there .
neutral	i placed multiple calls to fedex and was given incorrect information and was disconnected multiple_times when asked to speak to a manager .
neutral	i finally spoke to a manager who did not know where or what happened to my package and she planned on calling me the next_day at 0pm when the shipping warehouse was open .
neutral	once again , fedex failed and did not return my phone_call .
neutral	i called fedex once again and spoke with a representative who told me that my package had been left at the leasing office of my apartment building .
neutral	i am unsure of why it took me 0 + hours of multiple phone_calls for this information to get to me .
neutral	fedex did not leave any type of notice on my door about the package being left at the leasing office so naturally i assumed that it had been delivered to the wrong place .
neutral	i am very pleased with partsgeek but very displeased with the shipping company and s &_h prices .
neutral	i bought these brake rotors due to them being half the price that anyone locally could offer .
neutral	the shipping took a lot longer_than i expected but there was alot of snow storms .
neutral	the packaging was not sufficient which is why i feel lucky they werent damaged .
neutral	it was a cardboard_box with the large bubble packs .
neutral	and then the boxes with my rotors in them .
neutral	all 0 boxes were mangled and crushed and a number of the bubble packs were popped .
neutral	the box was also damp and soggy and just falling_apart .
neutral	i believe this is due entirely to the shipping company though however it couldve been packaged much_better .
neutral	i also was really put off by the cost of shipping but it could have been worse .
neutral	so to summarize .
neutral	price was good .
neutral	product came unharmed .
neutral	packaging was destroyed , packed poorly , and mistreated on its journey .
neutral	i gave the website 0_stars because while it did locate me a lender .
neutral	it was only one and the lender was in the west indies !
neutral	i didn ’ t feel_comfortable with using a lender not locate in the usa .
neutral	i have to say the new site is awful and slow its become more cumbersome to shop on the site and i have decreased going on .
neutral	also the fact you place items in the shopping bag and it times out .. so frustrating
neutral	the quote was lost and needed to be followed_up upon .
neutral	the order was lost and needed to be followed_up upon .
neutral	enough said .
neutral	having ordered flowers for mother '_s day to be delivered to her i '_m disappointed with the service thus_far .
neutral	my mother is yet to receive the flowers i ordered for her .
neutral	very disappointing as i wanted them to be on time as unfortunately i couldn_'_t go home to see her .
neutral	she is now aware that they are to be delivered and now it '_s a case of anticipation rather_than surprise .
neutral	i have used this company before ( last_year ) and was impressed as the flowers are beautiful and of high_quality , but however this wasn_'_t the case on this occasion .
neutral	poor mammy , mother '_s day flowers on april fools it is then !
neutral	( hopefully )
neutral	i found the website to be easy to navigate through and the choices were on point "
neutral	i have always been pleased with the lights i have ordered especially my palm_trees .
neutral	i recently ordered some new candles for my windows and the electric light sensitive ones are great .
neutral	however i also ordered 0 battery candles and they are awful .
neutral	not only the fact you can barely see the bulb when it is lit .
neutral	they no_longer work after a week .
neutral	they weren_'_t left on all the time , they were on only in the evenings .
neutral	i am very disappointed .
neutral	ooga_lights i would stop selling them immediately .
neutral	website and purchasing was great .
neutral	i loved that it came right to my house .
neutral	also loved that the cabinet was solid_oak .
neutral	however , i was shocked that there was no back on the cabinet behind the drawer section .
neutral	for almost $_000 , i thought it would have been better made .
neutral	even it there was just a thinner piece covering that area .
neutral	i ordered 0 items from 00_dollar mall ; a varsity jacket and a chiffon button up shirt .
neutral	the varsity jacket has quickly become on of the items in my closet i will cherish , it is well made and very cozy .
neutral	the shirt on the other hand is the reason for the three star_rating , i ordered a size x - large and was sent a size small .
neutral	the shirt label that was clearly_visible behind the plastic packaging read small and so did the manufacturing printing on the package .
neutral	the bar_code sticker added by 00_dollar mall however read x - large .
neutral	i do plan on ordering from this site again , but i just hope they sort out their labeling accurately .
neutral	i put the cartridges in the printer , but it states the ink is low , so i don_'_t know if the ink is bad or if the ink is actually low .
neutral	it was a great transaction but i am not sure if i have ink in the cartridges !
neutral	!
neutral	i ordered 0 items and received one item within a week .
neutral	still_waiting on the other two items .
neutral	need large sized dog_food items for 0 doberman pinschers .
neutral	rarely in stock , rarely " new " available .
neutral	always bidding & takes time needed to finalize when foods & supplies needed @ home for dogs .
neutral	cannot_afford to wait 0 , 0 , 0 days while tajikistan bidding goes on .
neutral	usually wind up paying more than would if had jst gone to local_pet_supply_store & purch anyway .
neutral	stopped completely .
neutral	not worth the hasstle
neutral	my husband liked his ; mine ok .
neutral	i googled non_- prescription_eyeglasses and got your site .
neutral	i ordered my husbands which were bifocals .
neutral	i ordered for me what i thought were bi - focals , but were just reading_glasses which i already have plenty of .
neutral	so if you order , make_sure you know what you are ordering .
neutral	i love the prices and selection that global_eyeglasses offer but the processing time is ridiculous !
neutral	it does not take that long to make glasses !!
neutral	!
neutral	i ordered the pet rug which i like .
neutral	however , as soon as i placed the order i noticed i didn_'_t receive the $ 0 off so i called customer_service .
neutral	was told they couldn_'_t change the order but would only give me a $ 0 credit_towards another order .
neutral	i do not like that type of service and will not order anything_else from them even_though i have the $ 0 credit .
neutral	seems like a way to bilk customers .
neutral	ordered gift_cards for my college daughter .
neutral	i purchased priority 0 - 0 day postage .
neutral	she didn_'_t get her gift_cards for almost 0_wks .
neutral	not impressed .
neutral	perhaps i didn_'_t read the detail properly but i wasn_'_t expecting to have to make full payment on a booking for january .
neutral	i thought i was reserving a room for payment on departure , as you can on booking . com and other_sites .
neutral	the booking is cancellable and i am told i will get a full_refund if i do cancel so we '_ll see how that pans out if i do .
neutral	other than that , the site straight_forward and easy to use but i doubt i will use it again because of the payment thing .
neutral	the outside lights for £_00 . 00 were disappointing and i think i would at_least two_sets to look decent on a small tree .
neutral	i found that i could get an equivalent set for £_00 . 00 locally without the carriage .
neutral	i ordered my things .
neutral	one thing , the grips .
neutral	were not on stock .
neutral	i send a mail with a new delivery adress , and heard_nothing for weeks .
neutral	some of my mails were not able to be deliverede .
neutral	i tried to call you , but i was not able to get through to you .
neutral	i thought you had gone bankrupt !!
neutral	suddenly i received a mail , that my order had been sent .
neutral	one month after i sent my order .
neutral	i ordered an item for a birthday_present , paid_extra for 0st_class postage but the package arrived a week after the birthday .
neutral	had i known there would be a delay in delivery i could have planned for it .
neutral	there was no advise on ordering that there was a warehouse change or something along those lines .
neutral	however , the item was very good value and will keep until christmas !
neutral	thanks for quite delivery , but still_waiting for one item that was out of stock !
neutral	the flowers were delivered next_day which was good but i have to say a bit dissappointed with how many flowers there were for £_00 .
neutral	wish i had just bought some and taken with me to the hospital !!!!
neutral	they were very nice but as i said not as bit a bouquet as i thought for the money , sorry !!!
neutral	!
neutral	i was so happy when i found bcs as i needed to buy hipp baby formula .
neutral	i also ordered farleys rusks and other yummy food things .
neutral	i had high_hopes but i was disappointed .
neutral	firstly tge shipping : it took 0 days from ordering before the items were shipped , then another 0 days fir it to be delivered .
neutral	the tracking was ridiculous , all it said was arrived in usa but no next destination or estimated_arrival_date so i was in the dark for when my parcel was going to arrive .
neutral	then when my parcel finally arrived there were mistakes .
neutral	i ordered 0 boxes of farleys rusks but inly 0 arrived .
neutral	no note or explanation that they were out if stock so thats_why only 0 boxes were in the order so i had to call customer_service to ask why i was missing a box .
neutral	then i ordered 0 boxes of hipp formula stage 0 follow on milk and the invoice with the order states the 0 boxes but in the order i actually got 0 boxes of what i ordered and 0 box of hipp formula stage 0 growing up milk .
neutral	i called customer_service and was told a new box of formula will be ordered and sent to me and ill get an e_- mail confirmation once it has shipped .
neutral	i explained i was mad about the time it took to get this order so i was told it will be dealt_with quickly but its been 0 days and i still have not received an e_- mail yet !
neutral	the first time i booked it booked me with the wrong flight .
neutral	no one could help me switch it so i had to cancel it .
neutral	then i booked over the phone and they got the dates wrong so i had to cancel again !
neutral	i did speak to a guy_named bobby who was a huge help !
neutral	we got a new one booked and everything is set now
neutral	well_packaged item which arrived on time - shower was installled by my plumber who said ' it was easy to plumb ' and on testing said ' it was a nice powerful shower '.
neutral	just as i was about to book a room at a motel 0 in grants , new mexico , by using " booking . com ", an add for a super 0 on " easytobook . com " showed_up right next to the " booking . com " site .
neutral	since the super 0 was a better deal and a nicer motel for just $ 0 more , i switched over and continued my booking for the super 0 through " easytobook ",
neutral	unfortunately the dates i had plugged in ( oct . 0 - 0 ) for the motel 0 stay did not transfer over to the new booking , and old dates from a previous search for an early stay at a different place in my road_trip ( oct 0 - 0 ) were the onesthat did transfer over to the new booking .
neutral	i called easytobook customer_service , and they called the super 0 and were able to correct the date on my booking from oct . 0 - 0 to oct . 0 - 0 .
neutral	the only_thing i lost was a $ 0 . 00 coupon sale amount , that uped my bill to the super 0 .
neutral	e careful , however when you try to book a hotel in a town name that appears in more than one state ( i . e .
neutral	" mountain_home "), which can be found in both idaho and arizona and , i believe , even in one more state !
neutral	when searching for a suitable hotel in mountain_home , idaho , i almost booked a ramada_inn , which came up in " easytobook " as being located in mountain_home , idaho , listing just the street address without the name of the state .
neutral	suspecting the problem , i googled ramada_inn , mountain_home , idaho , and found there was no such hotel there .
neutral	it was actually located in a mountain_home of a different state , so i did not go_ahead with that transaction .
neutral	since there is a no refund policy at easytobook , that would have caused a big problem !!

neutral	я бронировала номер на easytobook ru , так как при поиске отеля данный сайт предложил мне наименьшую цену .
neutral	процесс оплаты не вызвал никаких нареканий - все стандартно .
neutral	подтверждение бронирования быстро пришло на e_- mail .
neutral	в личном кабинете можно посмотреть и отменить сделанные бронирования .
neutral	единственный минус - нельзя внести изменения , например предупредить отель о позднем прибытии .
neutral	если не сделать это сразу при бронировании ( если честно , то я не помню , была ли такая возможность ), то потом остается только связываться с отелем напрямую .
neutral	upd : кроме того я смогла распечатать информацию о бронировании только на русском языке .
neutral	не думаю , что на ресепшен отеля это смогут прочитать .
neutral	я пыталась распечатать подтверждение бронирования с англоязычной версии easytobook , но оно все равно было на русском .
neutral	сделайте пожалуйста возможность печати подтверждения бронирования на английском языке .
neutral	i had enjoyed the ao experience until the day of delivery .
neutral	they said that you get notified at 00 : 00 by text of your two hour delivery slot .
neutral	my text never arrived , so i went online to find out my slot was from 00 : 00 - 00 : 00 , and i planned around this accordingly .
neutral	when 00 : 00 arrived and no delivery in sight , i went online again to see that my slot had been changed to 00 : 00 - 00 : 00 , so i called them .
neutral	in the end the delivery did arrive within the revised time_slot , but i could really have done with knowing this in advance , we had a relative in hospital and plans were changed because of ao that affected a sick relative .
neutral	in the end it all worked out , but i was left dealing frustrated .
neutral	i cannot knock the efficiency , but the whole_process took quite a long time .
neutral	i did get complete updates at every_stage but overall it took just too long .
neutral	so if anyone is in a hurry for cash , don_'_t count on this service !
neutral	this is not to say i would never use it again but now at_least i know how long to wait .
neutral	booked a hotel .
neutral	got a good deal but didn_'_t find out about the extra_fees until i had already put in my credit_card info .
neutral	$_00 / day hotel fee , $_00 / day parking fee .
neutral	it was still a good deal but not what i had originally_planned on .
neutral	hotel was great .
neutral	i don_'_t like that when u call in u have to give phone_number ss #, pay date , date , address when i am already an account holder !!!
neutral	i think they need to make up a pin or something for each account that way this can be a easier way !
neutral	mindy was great but we couldn_'_t get credit_card to go through .
neutral	called my company it was valid .
neutral	second credit_card was perfect .
neutral	i ordered some of the mesh packing bags for a friend , as she had admired mine , and was delighted go get an_email offering a 0 %_discount so rushed to order some .
neutral	imagine my disappointment when i went right through the site to paying but with no opportunity to claim my discount .
neutral	i even sent an_email to customer_services to enquire why it had not been usable , no reply , another black mark !
neutral	paid for next_day delivery in the afternoon , but didnt receive the goods the next_day , on contacting supplier was advised the order was placed too late , had i known that i wouldn_'_t have paid for next_day delivery as the goods then arrived too late for what they were initially ordered for .
neutral	i needed to make a multi - city journey between ohio , two cities incalifornia , and back again .
neutral	i found a ticket that would work -- not cheap but okay price - wise , but the timing of the flights would work well .
neutral	when i selected the flight minutes later , during the time i was reviewing options , the price had jumped up .
neutral	this may not be travelocity '_s fault , but it was irritating !
neutral	how do i view my bookings with sky_park ??
neutral	how do i log in to see what i have booked ?
neutral	gain loyalty discounts for booking frequently ?
neutral	no , i cant find cheaper .
neutral	the " competition " quotes identical prices on identical products .
neutral	it would have been nice the product would have been on time .
neutral	i purchased a square_trade warranty on their website for my laptop .
neutral	a little over a year after purchase , my laptop died .
neutral	i actually took it to a local computer repair center here , just to get a diagnosis .
neutral	they told me that the hard_drive was defective .
neutral	i then filed a claim with square_trade .
neutral	0 - 0 days_later , the box came in the mail that i had to send my laptop in .
neutral	about 00 days_later , i received my laptop back .
neutral	they replaced a bunch of stuff , but not the hard_drive .
neutral	so i turned on my laptop and it was the same problem .
neutral	i contacted squaretrade again , and again i had to ship my laptop .
neutral	so i sent it back .
neutral	00 days_later i received an_email_stating that the issue was a software issue and software issues were not covered_under the warranty .
neutral	they advised me to reinstall my operating_system .
neutral	when i finally got my laptop back , i couldn_'_t even turn it on .
neutral	i called yet again .
neutral	they stated it was a software issue .
neutral	i said no , i actually had it diagnosed , and it needed a new hard_drive .
neutral	they then told me at this point , i would need to take it someplace local , pay for the bill out of pocket , then get reimbursed .
neutral	i said , " absolutely not , i want a refund of the purchase price of my laptop ".
neutral	square_trade states that if they cannot fix your item , they will reimburse you the purchase price .
neutral	they said they would have to have a manager call me back .
neutral	i was never called back .
neutral	so i called back and said i needed to speak to a manager because i was either going to get a refund , or i was going to file a report with the better business_bureau .
neutral	after 00_minutes of being on hold , i was told i would receive a refund .
neutral	i needed to send them my laptop where it would become their property , then they would send me my reimbursement through paypal .
neutral	that is exactly_what happened .
neutral	i made a reservation with one company and then found another company with a cheaper rate for the same size unit .
neutral	however , i do not need the unit until the end of the month .
neutral	so i made another reservation with the cheaper company .
neutral	two_days_later the cheaper company said that he only had one unit and could not hold it that long .
neutral	isn_'_t this the purpose of reservations .
neutral	when i moved out , i had to go to two different places to pay a move out fee and they still_haven_'_t refunded the rent for the month i moved out .
neutral	the guys at the desk were nice , but said they ' d have to talk to their managers to get my rent refunded .
neutral	guess they forgot to talk to their managers .
neutral	to order the product , i was on hold for 00_minutes before finally getting through to an operator - from there it was relatively easy .
neutral	the item was despatched on time but unfortunately when it was delivered 0 days late by the carrier i was yet again on hold for a very long time waiting to speak to an operator at sport and leisure .
neutral	the final call to chase up delivery i had to wait almost 00_minutes in a queue - not good enough i '_m afraid .
neutral	item arrived just in time for christmas and is fine .
neutral	have any of your assistants actually assembled the larger items of furniture ?
neutral	we were told it was easy and i '_m sure it is if you have plenty of muscle handy .
neutral	my husband is 00 i '_m 00 we and my daughter struggled to lift the wardrobe onto the base and line it up with the pegs .
neutral	i '_m sure the experts assemble it in no time and without trapping their fingers underneath ouch !!
neutral	!
neutral	carpet right delivered and fitted the carpet , fitting cost us £_00 .
neutral	why do you not provide a fitting service we can '_t be the only elderly customers who don_'_t have the strength to lift solid_oak_furniture .
neutral	as for not damaging the packing maybe you should also demonstrate how one lifts a large heavy wardrobe out of a cardboard_box without_damaging the box or the packing_material .
neutral	having had my moan , yes you guessed i '_m a grumpy old woman , now it is all assembled together and in place we love it .
neutral	who_knows i might even be tempted to take a look with a view to buying another chest of drawers .
neutral	last night i booked two rooms at the peery hotel in salt_lake city , ut and i was so greatful for how easy it was and how nicely you presented the advertizement for the hotel ..
neutral	it was a great experience and i will use easytobook the next time .
neutral	i like the items on the site because i am shopping for a big man and that can be very difficult .
neutral	my complaint is that the website is difficult to navigate .
neutral	it '_s hard to find the items .
neutral	the " search " bar is not helpful if the item you want is not listed , e . g .
neutral	a jacket .
neutral	also , different manufacturers size differently so sometimes you need a smaller or larger_size than the size usually ordered .
neutral	returns are very expensive .
neutral	the site would be greatly improved if it offered free_shipping and / or free returns ( with a return_label ).
neutral	air service - the flight was delayed going there because they didn_'_t check the luggage door so we had to go back .
neutral	my seat did not recline at all .
neutral	that was uncomfortable .
neutral	coming_back we were delayed almost 0 hours .
neutral	no one was at the desk to ask questions_regarding the delay .
neutral	when she did arrive , she was a bit rude .
neutral	the hotel had damp rugs in the room which made it smell musty .
neutral	no extra pillows available until the last night ?
neutral	the smoke detector starting chirping at 0 : 00 in the morning the second night .
neutral	after an_hour , we took it off the wall per the front_desk because he couldn_'_t leave his post .
neutral	the breakfast spread was decent .
neutral	we were not able to enjoy the amenities because we had another engagements .
neutral	but the hotel seemed to offer a lot of things i contacted travelocity 0 times via_email because i had a voucher to use .
neutral	i never got the $_00 credit .
neutral	i asked for it to be applied to the credit_card ... still no response .
neutral	de nombreux modèles fashion abordables , service et_livraison_rapide , sav client aimable .
neutral	a conseiller à_mes amies !
neutral	i had originally_booked a flight to hawaii with 0 stops each way .
neutral	american cancelled the first flight which made me go to 0 stops .
neutral	i paid for 0 , yet did i get any $$ back ?
neutral	no .
neutral	did they care that i was traveling with an 00 year_old_mother ?
neutral	no .
neutral	they said they could not put us on any other flights but american .
neutral	really ?
neutral	you couldn_'_t change it to " work with all your carriers to ensure my satisfaction ?"
neutral	um ....... i '_ll probably go elsewhere next time .
neutral	i think you should be able to use your discount on top of your reward_points .
neutral	top part of light was squashed down , side panels were fallen_off and a light_bulb had smashed so i got glass in my hand !
neutral	otherwise once i had straightened if out and fixed if back up it worked okay and looks quite good .
neutral	i chose lensfactory to replace my eyeglass lenses because of their pricing .
neutral	they charge 00_% less_than getting my photochromic lenses replaced locally , so i went for it .
neutral	my eyeglasses took 0 days longer to complete than quoted on the website .
neutral	when they arrived , the left lens is distorted where it joins the frame .
neutral	it does not affect my vision so i did not file a claim with lensfactory , but i am giving the 0_star_rating because of the imperfection .
neutral	this is an obvious imperfection that i would not have accepted from a local provider , but i guess i got what i paid for ... cheap photochromic lenses that are less_than perfect but good enough that i am still wearing them .
neutral	the equipment was delivered quite slowly .
neutral	the box was damaged and split_open .
neutral	equipment was missing .
neutral	equipment that was there was of good quality .
neutral	informed tennis_nuts within 0 days subsitute equipment was sent .
neutral	chap was very helpfull , but as english was not his first language this delayed everything and so took much longer to find suitable flights & book them .
neutral	this seems a totally false economy & could even frustrate customers to the point of hanging up & trying online again later i was very close to ending the call .
neutral	please rethink this policy .
neutral	i ordered a start up kit on june_00th and as of july 00 i still have no products .
neutral	order number 000000000 .
neutral	customer_service has_been hit and miss .
neutral	some are helpful and some are very unhelpful and rude .
neutral	i bought the led harness for my dog and it worked great however , the led_lights came out of it and got lost during a walk - it was in the daytime so they were not lit and now we cannot find them ... now it is just a harness - maybe they should stitch the opening a little more so that the lights don_'_t come out so easily - other than that , it arrived to me very quickly so that part of it was good
neutral	i ordered a deep dish pizza from them along with the new jalapeno / cheese bread .
neutral	well , the deep dish seemed more like a hand tossed pizza and wasn_'_t all that great !
neutral	the jalapeno bread was good but wish their pizza was a little better !
neutral	this was my first and possible last time i order ... the company isn_'_t bad , but i was un - happy with a few things ... it took_forever for the package to ship out , i got the item today and everything but one i was able to keep .
neutral	i am a bbw girl and in 00_% of all clothing makers i am a true 0x women as far as tops go because i have a big chest .
neutral	i orders 0 of your 0x tops and only one was actually able to fit my chest size .
neutral	the clothing description should have stated that the fit on those are smaller then usual .
neutral	it could still pass for a 0x but it woud be tight on a women who wares a 0x ... it would be best for a person_who wares a 0x .
neutral	so in other words ... the clothing runs on a small sized of the stated size .
neutral	now , i have to ship everything , but one item back :( and the big diappointment is not only do i not get a refund for the shipping i paid to get he item , but i have to pay and not be refunded the shipping i have to pay to send the items back .
neutral	not happy about it .
neutral	we enjoyed the river_cruise included in the bus_tour , however the bus_tour itself was not well_organised at all .
neutral	we waited at the bus_stop by westminster bridge for about half an_hour before a bus finally turned_up that was heading west .
neutral	the crowd of people waiting there was so big that not everybody got a seat and the situation got worse as the journey carried on , people were complaining of overcrowding in the downstairs area and as it was such a hot day it was blisteringly hot in that section too .
neutral	when we got to park lane we were suddenly told that the tour was finishing there and i think that just because of the sheer amount of people complaining on the bus they had to finish driving the whole route .
neutral	not a great experience , probably_won_'_t do it again .
neutral	i ordered some items , received them last friday and 0 of the 0 were defective .
neutral	i wrote a nasty gram complaint and immediately received a response .
neutral	e_- mail stated gladly sending replacements .
neutral	i '_ll upgrade to 0_stars if received in a timely_fashion and these are not defective .
neutral	for first time purchase however , not impressed receiving non functional items that had the potential to harm my fur_babies .
neutral	willing to give another chance if this is fixed .
neutral	would have been happier if i could have had easy access to delivery times which would have reassured me that my good would be delivered in time for christmas .
neutral	worth trying
neutral	i have a delongi coffee machine and the capsules keep slipping through , i have to get them just in the right spot then push down the handle , unlike nespresso ones that just slot in .
neutral	the coffee however is comparable to nespresso .
neutral	price competitive shame about delivery driver who said " he hadnt got time to piss about " when delivering my garden furniture and left it wedged in my gateway promptly got back in his lorry and did indeed " piss off "!
neutral	nice service not !
neutral	i had to try and unwrap the large bundle and get it off the pallet on my own whlst it was stuck in my gateway .
neutral	on the whole i have had all the cashback i expected but a couple of times i have lost out .
neutral	most recently £_00 from waitrose .
neutral	promised on first online shop , but after six_months was told i went through another agent to site .
neutral	i didn_'_t .
neutral	so lost my cashback .
neutral	very disappointed .
neutral	i feel let_down and now wonder which cashback i '_ll lose next .
neutral	i booked a room for a colleague , donna liu .
neutral	the booking agent did not ask whether i was a marriott member , so i did not receive any credits for this booking .
neutral	this should be asked each time .
neutral	the booking agent was fairly slow , and it took a while for him to understand that i was booking this room for someone_else vs . myself .
neutral	it was hard to understand and hear the booking agent , he may not have been talking clearly , plus there was alot of background_noise ( other agents ).
neutral	it took about 0_weeks to get in , broke the first day .
neutral	i am keeping it on for now without the main charm .
neutral	i have no problem with the anything but your packaging is horrible .
neutral	the boxes you pack products in are way to flimsy .
neutral	this is the second i have received a shipment .
neutral	the first time the boxes were half opened and falling_apart .
neutral	this second time , as before the boxes were falling_apart and there was a gash in one of the litter_boxes and litter was flowing all over the inside of the packaging box .
neutral	if you are going to ship , use boxes that are sturdy .
neutral	if this continues i will rethink my business with you .
neutral	part came in great condition
neutral	hey if you are in amsterdam and would you like to have a nice and friendly stay in a hostel with direct park view and really kind and sweetheart management team
neutral	i will say
neutral	hostel sarphati could be cool for you .
neutral	i ordered before 00 . 00am for delivery next_day as_advertised .
neutral	waited in all day no delivery .
neutral	emailed next_day and was told it was on the van for delivery that day , but couldn_'_t give any indication what time of day .
neutral	we ordered a raspberry pi board which arrived quickly (!).
neutral	the price was the best we found , and it arrived in good shape ( we think so_far ), but i '_m a bit surprised that it did .
neutral	it arrived in a padded_envelope ( the kind with a layer of small bubbles ).
neutral	one of the pins was poking through the anti static wrapper , but it seems ok .
neutral	it was marginally ok .
neutral	the anti static wrapper wasn_'_t sealed and had no sticker !
neutral	i also thought it would arrive in a box with lots of padding .
neutral	well , let '_s say i always hope that online companies will pack fragile things sensibly , but they very seldom do .
neutral	about 00_% don_'_t .
neutral	i was pretty worried when i saw the awful packing job especially because it was a present for our son and we were presenting it the very next_day !
neutral	i thought there was no way it was going to be alright after all that .
neutral	so please take heed .
neutral	maybe there '_s a company out there that knows or cares how to pack things for shipping but i haven_'_t found one yet .
neutral	a small one person company or two i '_ve come_across knew how to .
neutral	thank_you for the opportunity to give my ( our ) input .
neutral	thanks for your quick answer !
neutral	i have found that the bonline team said what i wanted to hear yet did not deliver .
neutral	the process of setting_up my new website with them was not as easy as i thought and there were lots of mistakes made .
neutral	it took 0 days for the website to function fully and since then i have been happy with my website .
neutral	now that the hard work has_been done , i feel pleased with my website and believe that the bonline team will_continue to assist in making improvements .
neutral	i ordered 0 gift_cards on dec . 00th and they were not sent out until dec . 00th .
neutral	i have been a long time customer so there was no reason for it to take 0 days to process .
neutral	i may not use them again if i need a gift to take less time
neutral	just find the charges on paypal a little_steep - for this reason i avoid using it unless i have to .
neutral	three_times in one day we waited over 00_minutes for one of your buses .
neutral	in two instances , 0 green buses came by before one of yours showed_up .
neutral	your drivers were friendly and polite , but your buses don_'_t come round as regularly as you advertise .
neutral	my tuxedo cat has gained too much weight , and he is big .
neutral	i have tried other dry_cat_foods that are for the large cat .
neutral	the first one was so long ago , i think it worked but i honestly don_'_t remember .
neutral	the current brand i just purchased was science_diet & it might work ; will have to wait several weeks to see if there is some results .
neutral	one thing that does bother me is that in the ad for the science_diet cat_food , i don_'_t recall seeing anything regarding the ingredients .
neutral	what it does have or doesn_'_t have .
neutral	i should have caught it , but i didn_'_t .
neutral	the ingredient_list includes in the first five ~ is corn & wheat .
neutral	i didn_'_t read past that , i was a bit shocked , & i was mad at myself & at the online pet_supply company .
neutral	it seems that someone should have put in an ad or comment .
neutral	the cat_food bag has already been opened & the weight of it to ship back would be too much .
neutral	not sure if i will buy this brand or from this online pet_food supply again .
neutral	one last comment , i am glad that the cat_food was shipped to my door .
neutral	thank_you
neutral	i ordered the filters on line .
neutral	however when i finished the transaction , i realized that i had omitted to take_advantage of the 0 %_discount for orders over $_000 . 00 .
neutral	i emailed customer_service immediately , but it took almost 0 days to let_me know that they had credited my account with the 0 %.
neutral	i checked my credit_card for 0 more days , and the money had not been credited .
neutral	i emailed again and asked how the money was going to be returned to me .
neutral	i have since been credited the money , but no one got back to me answering my e_mail .
neutral	it was not a lot of money , but if you are that way over a little , how can i trust you with any more orders . the person the person that emailed me and i emailed was wendy woodard . hope this helps .
neutral	the major problem which i faced was with my credit cart .
neutral	wimdu says that supports american_express , but is not true .
neutral	the trancaction was unsuccessful but the bank constantly assured_me that my card was fine .
neutral	wimbu didn_'_t have a solution ( after a very long conversation , many many emails , phone_calls , and i don_'_t know how many different people ) and finaly asked me to contact american_express and ask for a special licence in order to complete my booking !!
neutral	at the end i made the booking via_paypal which wasn_'_t really my first choice ...
neutral	during this unpleasant situation , i never had the chance to use my promotional_code .
neutral	this kind of coupon is for one use only and expires right after , regardless if the transaction is succesful or not .
neutral	the system needs a lot of improvement in the booking area .
neutral	without the support of my host during this adventure , i was never able to make the booking .
neutral	i have to emphasise that the hosts who i made a deal with them until now are excellent and the houses were exactly as at the wimdu .
neutral	i ordered a super_cute dress that i wanted to wear for my first time out in vegas .
neutral	took me forever to go through all of the pages to find it .
neutral	the problem i had was when i received my order i noticed that the dress had a huge hole on the underarm part of a sleeve !
neutral	it was easy to fix myself , but was an inconvenience .
neutral	products should be checked before sent out to their customers .
neutral	other than that everything else was okay , i received my product a few_days before the estimated_date , so that was great !
neutral	so all in all , the website is a good place to shop for cute_clothing ... just don_'_t expect it to be in one piece .
neutral	the sight is very user_friendly until you get to the shipping portion .
neutral	there are only two options , send all cards to the same address or send cards to separate addresses .
neutral	it would be more efficient if you could select multiple cards to go to one address and add additional addresses as necessary .
neutral	the person helping_me constantly talked and repeted himself unnecessarily .
neutral	and , since he never quit talking , i had to constantly correct him bc he didn_'_t hear my answers to his questions at one point i almost hung_up to try again later
neutral	do not like charges to credit_card prior to shipping product .
neutral	shipping_charges way too high .
neutral	the flower_basket and ballon ordered for a cousin '_s 00th_birthday were delivered on time .
neutral	the chosen florist did not include the sender '_s name or their own details .
neutral	my very resourceful cousin managed to trace them by phoning several local_florists - who referred her back to iflorist .
neutral	they then phoned me for permission to tell her who had sent the flowers !
neutral	the florist '_s reason for not including their own details was " their labels dont stick to the baskets " - it was pointed_out that they could stick the label on the card .
neutral	i would hesitate to use iflorist again , which is a shame as the flowers are lovely
neutral	had ordered shower_tower and plumber came earlier_than_expected to install .
neutral	when delivery was received , packaging was damaged and since we had to purchase another tower , we wanted to return item .
neutral	several emails back and forth and we still do not have information to return product or refund .
neutral	for the record , the item delivered does appear to be acceptable in quality however there is alot of plastic components .
neutral	petflow has very reasonable prices for the products and on time delivery .
neutral	however , the delivery guy just dropped it over my gate , didn_'_t even_bother to open the gate to place the item
neutral	in front of my door .
neutral	because the box are thrown over the gate , some of the cans i ordered were damaged .
neutral	i don_'_t know if they have their own delivery man , but delivery needs improvement .
neutral	i placed two different orders ( unaware that my boss wanted two items from your company ) within minutes of each other .
neutral	when i asked if shipping could be combined and sent in one box , through customer_service , i did not receive a response until a few_days_later , letting_me know that once orders are placed they can not be changed or maniupulated .
neutral	the email also stated i could return if i wasn_'_t happy with the product .
neutral	i just wanted shipping to be combined into one box , we are happy with the products .
neutral	a long time is the premise !
neutral	always carry the day of departure !
neutral	00 / 00 / 00 i ordered a bag , and about the other day ( 00 . 00 . 0000 ) should get shoes !
neutral	i waited for six_months at_least some things !
neutral	pleased one they keep in touch !
neutral	always responded to the letters . i hope they fix .
neutral	no_problems with the company but the item looked larger in the photo - doesn_'_t look like it would hold much money for a money clip .
neutral	part of why petflow is great in theory is its ability to send heavy , bulky pet_food and litter to my door .
neutral	i am willing to pay for the expense of premium pricing as long as the stuff is delivered to my actual door , and not to the mailroom .
neutral	because the point is not having to actually haul this stuff all the way upstairs myself .
neutral	petflow uses fedex , who has_been absolutely awful .
neutral	they refuse to deliver to my door , and petflow '_s packaging has gotten destroyed by fedex several_times , and fedex has turned around and returned the items without anyone letting_me know what happened .
neutral	petflow accepted the return without letting_me know .
neutral	and what i needed was cat_litter , so this absence of a regular shipment means dire consequences for my kitties , who do not like a dirty toilet .
neutral	i think petflow is better in theory than in practice .
neutral	i will probably cancel because i '_m so frustrated with the lack of accountability in getting my stuff to me as_promised .
neutral	i am still_waiting to hear back from someone so that i can place my order .
neutral	was unable to access the " cleaning product " portion of your website .
neutral	thank_you ,

neutral	the service is excellent , we did get next_day delivery , and well_packaged .
neutral	sadly , the brushes are very stiff to get on and off our oral_b electric_toothbrush .... tricky for kids .... perhaps impossible actually .
neutral	the heads do not last along as oral_b , i had to change mine after 0_weeks .... the bristles had gone soft , and splayed , but considering how much_cheaper they are , possibly they will work out cheaper_than the branded replacements .
neutral	give them a try , and see what you think .... just don_'_t buy loads on the first ordere like i have !
neutral	staff were friendly and helpful .
neutral	the room was clean and neat .
neutral	for the price , though , it would have been nice to have had a microwave and refrigerator in the room .
neutral	also , the washcloths were thin and minimal .
neutral	one had a lot of eye makeup left over on it even_though it had been cleaned .
neutral	just wondering_if they need to use a little more soap in laundry .
neutral	i know that i rinse out my makeup washcloth but not everyone does this .
neutral	it was very handy to get to the steindler clinic - it was right in back of the hotel .
neutral	other_companies routinely deliver the same product in 0 days .
neutral	this took nearly a week , & i was without for 0 - 0 days .
neutral	i won_'_t be ordering again , unless it '_s not needed promptly .
neutral	things i did not like :
neutral	0 .
neutral	sim_card was loose , and phone did not work , at first .
neutral	0 .
neutral	phone_calls international had echo
neutral	i tried to order a large number of items but kept having problems with the shopping_cart function .
neutral	i was worried my on - line purchase might not go through correctly so i called customer_service about 0pm est . to place the order -- finally hung_up after 00 + minutes on hold and listening to their recording over & over & over .
neutral	prices - 0_stars
neutral	service - 0_star
neutral	if you have less_than favorable credit and need a quick loan they will hook you up .
neutral	the link to the site for your bought goods very rarely works , but most staff are helpful when ringing .
neutral	not quite as good as groupon but getting there .
neutral	had an upright freezer delivered admin was perfect but i explained to the delivery_men that i was now alone having recently lost my husband and did they not unpack it as the previous freezer i had delivered was unpacked for me .
neutral	i really struggled to unpack this freezer by myself being a small lady and a pensioner it was so difficult to lift it off the polystyrene on my own and then have to put it in the position where it had to go , it would only have taken the delivery_men about 0 mins to do the job for me .
neutral	incredible service , delivered next_day by the same courier as the bed_frame which was bought from a different manufacturer - could be coincidence but i like to see a reduced carbon foot print .
neutral	the bed is well made but was described as firm , in fact it is more soft than medium .
neutral	this makes purchasing on line impossible as all bed manufacturers seems to name their own products differently and so if they don_'_t conform to the same criteria for firm medium and soft i don_'_t know how you can reliably buy from this manufacturer without first testing the beds .
neutral	they were what i was looking for but i didn_'_t realize i could buy a kit to make them myself .
neutral	i did purchase the rest of my wedding stickers at [_link ] for a fraction of the cost .
neutral	the room was clean .
neutral	the staff was courteous .
neutral	i would have liked a frig and microwave so we could have meals in the room .
neutral	i would stay there again .
neutral	the location is close to the major roads .
neutral	i would stay there again .
neutral	the breakfast was good and they had coffee and cookies during the day .
neutral	quality of business cards good , method of setting_up excellent .
neutral	sadly delivery time not met and so everything fell_apart re the good service up to that point .
neutral	response to delivery issue was prompt and good .
neutral	for the price of inner_circle i ' d like to see a better variety of items every_month to try .
neutral	i '_m sort of disappointed because there are so many natural makeup products out there and it seems like inner_circle is focused on room sprays and body lotions .
neutral	i '_m giving it another month and then i '_m calling it quits .
neutral	the wait for the shuttle was longer_than other rental_car companies and with two tired kids in tow , not a pleasant_experience .
neutral	the added fee for renting a carseat was also a surprise .
neutral	i added it to my reservation so i thought it was included .
neutral	i might have to call the company to clear this up .
neutral	i have paid_extra money when i booked my flight throughout you company .
neutral	there was administration_fee and also i paid_extra in terms of luggage .
neutral	i paid €_00 per luggage whilst with the direct flight company it was €_00 .
neutral	we started out with petflow almost two years_ago and love the delivery service .
neutral	we live in a rural_area and when we run low on dog_food it can be a real_pain to go all the way into town !!!
neutral	my only_complaint has_been with the availability of my dog_food recently .
neutral	i did cancel my subscription for a few_months and began purchasing from amazon .
neutral	they price went up last month , so i decided to give petflow a try once again .
neutral	i set my ship date for may 0nd .
neutral	here it is may_0th and i still do not have tracking_information on my account page .
neutral	i called yesterday and was told it would be shipping that afternoon and i should see an updated delivery estimate .
neutral	it has not happened so i will need to drive to petco today to get dog_food ….
neutral	i recently bought some whiskey from the whiskey_exchange and was very happy with the price and selection .
neutral	i proceeded to buy the whiskey which was a birthday_gift for my uncle .
neutral	i paid the p_& p which was for parcel_force and the estimated delivery time was 0 - 0days .
neutral	i ordered it on the monday and waited .
neutral	i then went online to track the parcel to see that it had been taken to the wrong depot , got lost somewhere between parcel_force and royal_mail .
neutral	i eventually got it by the skin of my teeth in time .
neutral	good company bad courier .
neutral	i am happy i was able to get a car due to bad credit .
neutral	they are extremely overpriced and are extremely pushy and they couldn_'_t take that i wasn_'_t ready to purchase that day .
neutral	i wanted to look around .
neutral	it was an alright experience .
neutral	the building was cold as it is in a warehouse .
neutral	thats to be expected .
neutral	i felt as if the guys in my local_store were a little sexist to be honest .
neutral	they looked at me like i was stupid when i asked a question , then my husband asked the same thing and they were like oh sir , this is how this works .
neutral	plus when i called in to ask how big the couch was , they told me it was new unopened in a box .
neutral	that was not the case .
neutral	it was no way shape or form in a box , which made transportation for it a little harder /
neutral	same as above
neutral	my requested delivery was nearly a week late tried tracking all it said on line was that it was accepted what on earth that is supposed to mean ive no_idea !!!!
neutral	so was not very impressed i requested a set day as a thankyou so you expect it to arrive on that day !!!
neutral	sent couple of e . mails with no response finally managed to get thru on the telephone at monday_lunchtime then had to go on live_chat monday_evening as i didnt have a response when i had arrived home from work that evening !!
neutral	finally the flowers but when the flowers finally arrived they were lovely & fresh so just aswell !!!
neutral	: 0 (
neutral	my vet turned me on to petflow .
neutral	i was upset as i ' d just moved from iowa to washington and couldn_'_t find someone of the holistic and organic_foods my 0 dogs were used to eating ( some have allergies ).
neutral	she was right about the great selection and excellent prices on most of the larger items .
neutral	i still turn to amazon for a few things , but i '_ve recommended petflow to others .
neutral	the only_thing i was upset about was the shipping once it left the facility ( and petflow has no real control over that ).
neutral	it was timely shipped and i was super happy about that .
neutral	then it took over 0_weeks to get to my home when i ' d been expecting it in a matter of days .
neutral	petflow was very willing to facilitate communication between me and fedex ; however , it does make me question whether or not i want a repeat experience based on who the transporter is .
neutral	:(
neutral	this was my first occasion of ordering lenses online -
neutral	shame my lenses didnt arrive originally - but when i advised customer_services - they resent them recorded delivery .
neutral	so i think i might return to lenstore - but not sure yet .
neutral	i purchased a bag online .
neutral	i was really excited so get it but they sent it to the wrong house .
neutral	then when i got it i discovered it was the wrong bag .
neutral	i took the bag and my invoice to a superdry shop in the fort who told me i couldn_'_t return it there .
neutral	it would need to be the store in glasgow town centre .
neutral	i then took it to that store to be told i don_'_t have the correct details on the invoice .
neutral	apparently it was my fault i didn_'_t have the price of the item on the invoice .
neutral	i said i would show them my bank_statement if it meant that much even_though i could tell them to the penny how much i paid for it .
neutral	eventually after managers consent they swapped my bag for the correct one .
neutral	i purchased online to save me all the hassle of going the hour round_trip into town but in the end it would have been easier if i just went in myself .
neutral	what a waste !
neutral	... nice bag though .
neutral	not sure if it was worth the hassle !
neutral	the jacked it great , fits really well and is so warm !
neutral	originally ordered an xs however was a bit small so returned it special next_day delivery costing me £_00 and it took over 0_weeks to receive the new gillet , certainly made me think_twice about ordering from superdry online in the future
neutral	beautiful website , clean and easy to navigate .
neutral	great variety of products at reasonable prices .
neutral	the shipment process has taken over a week and we are still_waiting for it , probably because the product shipped from new_jersey and is trying to make it '_s way to nevada .
neutral	the pony_express could have gotten us our dog_food quicker .
neutral	make_sure you order while you still have plenty of food on hand .
neutral	i rec ' d the 0 pairs of skinny_jeans i ordered .
neutral	had to send them back because they were so small .
neutral	i phoned and was told by the customer_service rep that if you wear a size 0 , you must order a size 00 .
neutral	this was not mentioned on the web_site that i could see .
neutral	i had to return the jeans for credit to my account .
neutral	they were the cutest jeans i '_ve ever_seen and there was not a size 00 for any of the 0 that i had originally chosen .
neutral	please watch for them as i mailed them back today .
neutral	the book arrived in a timely_manner ; however , the condition ( although stated as lightly used ) was in much rougher condition than what i feel constitutes this label .
neutral	pages are falling out of the binding and many of the first pages are bent upward and wrinkled .
neutral	overall though , the service was good .
neutral	i love the charm of the footprints , but i wasn_'_t impressed with the bell on the charm or the length of the necklace .
neutral	i ordered one that should have been plenty long , but i couldn_'_t even wear it .
neutral	the order process and the length of time for them to send it was good .
neutral	well as an african american woman_who shops on the site regularly , i feel offended that we support this site as well but there are no black women modeling the clothes .
neutral	i personall am shaped where i wear an extra small or small sometimes medium depending_on the fabric and the women that model on the site are shaped beautifully but their are no ethinically shaped women .
neutral	the clothes should be modeled on women of all shapes of small .
neutral	there are ones with hips and butt , flat stomach and small boobs , or model shaped women that are perfect portion , or busty with flat stomach and big butt , or straight up and down or perhaps just hips and nothing else .
neutral	as a womans site , it shpuld be relatable to all , i feel this would add to your sales , not that you need it , while making everyone feel appreciated .
neutral	this is a site i recoomend often and i believe if i can add that they would definatly be able to find something no_matter_how they are shaped that would be great .
neutral	i have ordered a lot of stuff that i loved nd stuff that doesnt fit like it did the model and i hated .
neutral	if the model were shaped like me and i have a flat stomach a nice size butt and 00a boobs , i would better know how it would look on me and my body .
neutral	well hope this helps thank_you for asking .
neutral	also i did see one black girl and their are lots of extremely beautiful black women , i dont understand_why the one that is barely on there is mediocre looking .
neutral	we have women with tiny bodies , long hair and beautiful faces , im one of them and we come in lots of different shades .
neutral	the choice of cards is extensive so this is a great site for one stop_shopping .
neutral	i '_ve been able to purchase multiple cards for many of my friends and family for many occasions and they have totally enjoyed their experience .
neutral	from a user standpoint , the web_site is very easy to use .
neutral	order arrived and it was somebody_else '_s with my delivery note .
neutral	the mistake was very quickly rectified and the team apologetic . the order was just for worm and flea_treatment so no_harm done however not great for a first order but will use again .
neutral	hello -
neutral	i just received my first resume update .
neutral	also included was a cover_letter .
neutral	i am in a rush to complete this project , but i assumed it would be perfect right off the bat .
neutral	there were a few run - on sentences and a few sentences that didn_'_t properly blend with the entire resume .
neutral	i did send a lot of money with this company , and don_'_t feel that the price i paid was worth what i received in return .
neutral	i did pay for thank_you letters , along with a ' blast ' to a ww list of recruiters .
neutral	that hasn_'_t happened yet , as we are still finalizing everything .
neutral	overall , my resume does look a lot better , maybe i just had unclear expectations for the $ 0k i paid .
neutral	product ( inflatable cushion with pump ) arrived very promptly .
neutral	unfortunately the quality of the pump is so poor i haven_'_t even bothered to inflate the cushion .
neutral	am returning the whole package for a refund .
neutral	i might order again because the service has_been so good , but would choose my product carefully in future
neutral	the buttons looked exactly as i wanted - they were delivered on time - but i specifically requested a clip on back - not a pin - and they were all delivered with a pin backing .
neutral	i am still_waiting on it to arrive .
neutral	i have been without my washer for way too long .
neutral	lol
neutral	i recently rented a car in europe through autoeurope .
neutral	while the required extra_charges that amounted to $_00 were not included in the price quoted , they were listed in small_print elsewhere on the voucher .
neutral	checking other auto rental sights the same $_00 was nowhere to be found - until i called and quizzed an agent who confessed the charges would be added to the quoted price - added at the end of the rental when it was too late to change anything .
neutral	since these charges are required , they should be included up front in the quoted price for the rental !
neutral	we have seven pets and having their food delivered is convenient overall .
neutral	we have had a few missed deliveries because an item was back - ordered , but there was no proactive e_- mail notification .
neutral	i didn_'_t realize the order had been placed on hold until i realized we didn_'_t receive our delivery that week and logged_into the system to check the status .
neutral	the order interface is clumsy , the search_feature doesn_'_t always produce the correct results and it is nearly unusable from a mobile_device .
neutral	i think the prices are too high - but the products are good and delivery was fast as promise
neutral	i played extra to ship in 0 - 0 days and it took over a week .
neutral	i also had to call and check on it and it still hadn_'_t shipped .
neutral	i appears that you also charged more for 0 . day air .
neutral	;
neutral	there were plenty of buses and was a decent tour .
neutral	if you get on the recorded_tour commentary at any point ( rather_than the live tour ) beware some drivers who dont press play on the tape and skip past bits ... one driver on our tour didnt play any commentary for a good 00_mins which really turns it into an expensive bus_ride .
neutral	we used travelocity '_s top secret deal .
neutral	it was supposed to be a 0 . 0_star_rated hotel .
neutral	the travelocity representative was very helpful in setting_up my request as we we booking 0 rooms for 0 nights and a 0rd room for just one night .
neutral	the hotel we ended_up with was not a 0 . 0_star_hotel on the beach .
neutral	it was right off the freeway .
neutral	the " beach " was a small pond with garabage floating everywhere .
neutral	the pool was so filthy it was black and even_though the hotel was full i never saw a single person even go near the pool .
neutral	the hot_tub was broken .
neutral	rooms were large but cobwebs in most corners , one of the chairs were broken , you could see every repair they made .
neutral	we were supposed to get 00 - 00_% but when i asked about their rates we paid the same for 0 daof the rooms and more for the 0rd room .... no savings there .
neutral	was confused at first now i got my key and i think it is stupid how you have to send a photo of your id card
neutral	besides the awesome customer_service that was provided at this location , the area given to maneuver any sort of moving vehicle is so limited that you can see giant holes and areas where trucks have ran_into the side .
neutral	i witnessed two different 00 ' commercial trucks run_into the front office in the two hours i was moving my stuff in .
neutral	other than that , the $ 0 first month concession i received was topped with tons of fees , ranging_from insurance to lock to move - in .
neutral	ridiculous .
neutral	for 00 days i wound_up paying nearly $_00 .
neutral	oredered lenses and arrived within a couple of days however , the box had no plastic cover over it - the box had clearly been ripped_open , but am pleased to say the contents were all there .
neutral	safer packaging please as the contents were worth £_000 - not cheap !
neutral	!
neutral	have had great trouble printing off the voucher , unable to view the qr code !
neutral	will mean hassle on the day .
neutral	booked this option to make the travel hassle_free !!
neutral	!
neutral	they were delivered propmptly .
neutral	the prevail pull - ups fit well .
neutral	we feel that the product is not worth the money we paid , the wood is real soft when we put it together two of the screws were to long , the track that the doors roll on i would have thought that is would be steel instead of plastic .
neutral	i will say that when we had the problem with the damage they were quick to replace the damaged panel
neutral	i felt messed about over delivery dates with butler_fuels so not a happy customer .
neutral	well , whether it is thanks to my previous_review on trustpilot or to my patience , but , after several_months of hassle , i have finally received my refund from smartbuyglasses .
neutral	i admit that it is possible that my experience was just a particularly unlucky one .
neutral	the company did return my money , and gave_me a a small discount for my next purchase ... would i recommend this company to a friend ?
neutral	maybe , not sure .
neutral	i was able to purchase 0 pairs of pants for less_than $_00 , however there was little to no customer_service .
neutral	i was not approached once in regard to finding things , but overall the deal i got over rode the service i got .
neutral	got 0 unit with a chip in it was told to bring it back to check its a manufacturing damage ... not sure how you would tell .
neutral	rang up to check its in stock before i drive to warrington and its not .
neutral	oh and my bathroom fitters are here this weekend and can '_t finish it without the unit top .
neutral	so not very happy right now
neutral	we like the fish .
neutral	but too expensive , especially with the extra_charge for hawaiians .
neutral	we are thinking of buying it from whole foods when they are on sale .
neutral	because i thought they had ignored the extra we had paid for the probiotics to be cold - shipped .
neutral	when i called , i was reassured that it had actually been express shipped , and the shipment arrived in super quick time .
neutral	they need to be clearer on the invoice to avoid misunderstandings , but otherwise it was good service .
neutral	i bought this for my daughter '_s birthday .
neutral	it looked just the right thing on line as she does prefer leather jewellery but i was disappointed with the tag that is attached .
neutral	it was tarnished .
neutral	therefore makes it look worth a lot less_than i paid for it !
neutral	at £_00 it is expensive .
neutral	it is a nice slim leather strap ( which i wanted ) and as i am going to take off the tag and use my own charm , i decided to keep it .
neutral	i must_say the service and delivery was excellent , i could not quite believe_how quickly it came in first_class post .
neutral	just a shame i was disappointed with the gold .
neutral	vi boede i tre nætter på hotellet , og_det_var udemærket .
neutral	rent og pænt .
neutral	fin morgenmad .
neutral	der_var til gengæld rigtig koldt og lidt larm fra gaden , og_så_var værelset rigtig lille på_trods af at det_var et superior værelse .
neutral	jeg_synes , prisen var høj i forhold til , hvad vi fik og i forhold til , hvor det lå .
neutral	man kunne rent faktisk ikke komme til noget som_helst uden at skulle med metro eller bus .
neutral	det lå til gengæld tæt på .
neutral	en_anden gang vil jeg vælge noget tættere på centrum til_en lavere pris .
neutral	i love the glasses i got but the experience was a bit rocky with the time it took to get the glasses .
neutral	i expected one thing but took almost a month to get my glasses .
neutral	tracking the shipment was not the best either .
neutral	overall im happy with the product but they need to vamp up the experience with the company .
neutral	very poor customer_service .
neutral	the man that came to fit my tyres was lovely .
neutral	he fitted 0 nee tyres and changed my spare brand_new tyre onto the rim of my back tyre .
neutral	i couldnt fault him except ... today i have a complete flat on the wheel that had the spare put onto it .
neutral	i took it back to kwikfit who have advised there is nothing they can do as it is a problem with the alloy wheel .
neutral	apparently the old tyre on there was so old that as he removed it some of the ?
neutral	paont has removed resulting in the seal no_longer being there thus i need my alloy wheel reconditioned .
neutral	probably one of those things but still irritating , no warning that this could happen following fitting .
neutral	so after over 000 pound soent another £_00 to get alloy refurbished .
neutral	brilliant .
neutral	beställde utkörning till min mor .
neutral	får besked att_det inte går utan hon får hämta själv .
neutral	hon får samtal dagen före , inte på morsdag .
neutral	expedit säger att utkörning inte är beställd !!!
neutral	urdåligt .
neutral	den andra modern fick dock som hon skulle .
neutral	but my last order arrived with the package inside broken open and kitty_litter spilling on the floor !
neutral	not impressed as told bed_frame and mattress would come on the same day .
neutral	bed_frame came a day late and then when opened the hardware set ( all the washers , screws , nuts and bolts missing .
neutral	rang and was told would be sent out today but they did not arrive , so still_waiting .
neutral	if not here in a couple of days will be returning order .
neutral	i chose a beautiful all white bouquet to be delivered for a friend '_s birthday .
neutral	there was a very good reason i chose the all white bouquet .
neutral	i received an_email the day before they were due to be delivered saying that the florist didn_'_t have the white_roses so they would substitute for another color .
neutral	i did appreciate that they still made a flower delivery on the day i ordered but i was really disappointed that they didn_'_t have what they advertised .
neutral	my friend sent me a photo of the bouquet and again i was disappointed as it looked very lack lustre and only had 0 roses .
neutral	it was called the " tender purity " bouquet - premium .
neutral	there was nothing premium about this bouquet .
neutral	i don_'_t think i will use this florist again .
neutral	hi there , i wanted to give a review ofself storage . com which led me to a facility in morgan hill .
neutral	although the website was thorough in its details for each storage result , the overall number of results was extremely low .. about 0 for a major city like gilroy ca .
neutral	i did appreciate that the site was very user_friendly however .
neutral	i would be happy to provide feedback , but i have three automatic monthly shipments of dog_treats delivered to my house , and don_'_t know for which one i am providing feedback .
neutral	it would be more efficient and professional if trustpilot individualized these requests to spell out the order in question .
neutral	as for the website and finding the part at the right price i like parts_geek but as far as communicating with them i do not like i can only email them on a form they have chosen .
neutral	i would like to have a phne number in order to call and talk to them .
neutral	i ordered the wrong part number and went to get the rma info .
neutral	i foind that with no problem but then ups delivers a box that is damaged .
neutral	ups is called and given the info within the 00 hour_period of receipt of item .
neutral	i am told by upds to keep the package for at_least 0 days in case they need to send someone out to take a look at the package and they will contact me . turns_out no one calls me so i call ups and find that they state they will contact parts_geek and not me . ok so now i have the rma_# and will send back the package .
neutral	purchasing was a smooth_transition ... tracking_info provided and shipped via_usps .
neutral	pkg .
neutral	not at doorstep as indicated .
neutral	trying to resolve issue .
neutral	det_var ok antal omend ikke mange , så få gode bud jeg_fik på_min regnskabsopgave .
neutral	men agera har samlet sendt 00 opfølgningsmails , og_det_er dødirriterende .
neutral	jeg_har prøvet at skrive tilbage men må nu sætte agera som spam i min mail , da der ikek svares på_min henvendelse .
neutral	ærgerligt at det_er_det indtryk jeg sidder tilbage med , når det som_det handlede om egentligt gik fint .
neutral	great travel site .
neutral	i wish we could pick the departure and return flight separately , for timings .
neutral	the ipad app is worthless , so i had to pull out my laptop for booking and browsing .
neutral	there are good points and bad points for me .
neutral	the bad points are that although it stopped sweating of the underarms quite well it didn_'_t work at all the hands or feet which left me quite disappointed .
neutral	however , i '_m in love with the fact that it is odourless !
neutral	unlike every prescription treatment i have tried you can use it without_having to worry_about the strong medicinal smell it can leave on clothes and on your skin .
neutral	also with prescription - strength treatments they have left the skin on my hands red , sore and flaky .
neutral	perspi - guard was actually quite moisturising and i was very surprised to still have soft skin in the morning .
neutral	so although it didn_'_t work on the areas i wanted it to , i will_continue to use for my underarms , and as an ' in - between ' treatment alongside my prescription so that my hands don_'_t get as sore and dry .
neutral	overall i '_m still impressed this worked as well as it did :_d x
neutral	they provide a variety of services that help with cpc and cse and good customer_service .
neutral	however , i have had some problems with the usability of their services and data collection .
neutral	i can '_t trust the numbers they give me for clicks on cses and i cannot get the ids to be profitable .
neutral	they were big when i was in high_school ( 0 years_ago ) but have really fallen behind .
neutral	they seem to try to do what facebook does , but not as well .
neutral	i do still have my myspace though , just because there are videos on it that i don_'_t have anywhere_else .
neutral	we started off working with one individual who was very knowledgable , and had excellent communication_skills .
neutral	unfortunately he left the company and was replaced by someone_who was pleasant enough but a bit contrary and snarky .
neutral	he also clearly did not like the fellow we were first working with .
neutral	however , once the process moved along he did respond quickly and we sold the car .
neutral	overall i would recommend your company with the caveat not to expect a high degree of professionalism .
neutral	pretty good deals but i thought they were refundable with hotel in case of cancellation , but we are mislead & are refundable / cancellation with only travelocity
neutral	ordered item online with confirmation_email_saying items will be here within 0 - 0 days .
neutral	waited 0 days and got email_saying dispatched and will be with me within 0 days .
neutral	unacceptable time between ordering and dispatching .
neutral	arrived 0 working days after ordering .
neutral	received compensation .
neutral	items are perfect and might consider_using lenson in future .
neutral	good , quick delivery but really disappointed that these magnets don_'_t work on my cathedral products magnetic board .
neutral	can '_t be bothered to send them back .
neutral	i chose this firm as it seemed to specialise in ' powerful ' magnets .
neutral	ontrac is the worse carrier you could use !!!!
neutral	why not give the customer a choice ????
neutral	i want my fedx back !
neutral	i put a hold on a unit and despite that i got a confirmation that it will be held for me for 00 days it was sold to someone_else the same day .
neutral	so the hold is pretty_much useless , unless you pay right_away the unit can go just like that .
neutral	i think the system is as good as the managers are at the storage_facilities , they decide who they rent the unit to , not this system .
neutral	i logged on to my account and clicked on new activity detected .
neutral	all i saw was a blank white page .
neutral	i need to dnow what it said .
neutral	susan m . holloway
neutral	site too hard to use .
neutral	the website was easy to use , had lots of choices and was easy to complete purchase .
neutral	updates by email were also useful , but the mail however was incredibly slow ( about 00 days !
neutral	not sure why since almost nothing takes that long anymore .
neutral	i was very pleased at the start , thought being_able to play without discs was so much_better .
neutral	then i had to send identification because of fraud ( fair enough ), past that , got codes .... my last one didnt work !
neutral	contacted support , was very helpful in telling_me what they were going to do to fix my problem .
neutral	since then i '_ve had lack of communication !
neutral	emails_telling_me to do something but not how to do it !
neutral	i was then for some_reason sent my old code !
neutral	i dont understand how thats going to fix my problem .... time will tell as the sims0 . com site is down for maintenance at the minute .
neutral	i was instructed to " enter date night key in the sims 0 game loader / sims0 . com website " now that email was in capital letters which normally indicate shouting ( first email was not ) and the one containing my code after i replied expressing my unhappiness as a customer and asking how i get to this point on the website was ignored completely and a repeat of the previous email just with the code added .
neutral	adequate ... but needed four additional screws for secure fix and to take the " wobble " out of the swing .
neutral	not a task to be undertaken by the inept
neutral	i love travelocity selections , prices , all of it .
neutral	however , customer_service is a nightmare to get a question answered .
neutral	wait time is excessive .
neutral	agent in such a hurry to answer that she didn_'_t even wait for the whole question ~ and then was wrong .
neutral	agents need to speak_english clearly and without an attitude when asked to repeat ~ seriously , customer_service 000 .
neutral	from what i gather , my recent recipient of your flower delivery was happy with the bouquet .
neutral	since i live so_far away , i didn_'_t know when the flowers were delivered so an e_- mail to confirm delivery would be great .
neutral	also a special entry with the person '_s name that sent the flowers would be greatly_appreciated .
neutral	other_websites have that feature .
neutral	thanks
neutral	xpole is great if it '_s just you using it .
neutral	ordering was easy and i was very pleased with the quick response to my order .
neutral	but , a tape was wrapped around the pump of the oratene which caused the cap to twist open .
neutral	so when i opened the box to see my purchases both items were coated in oratene which had leaked out of the bottle .
neutral	maybe 0 / 00 was lost , not much , but i did have to clean up .
neutral	they are ok but only have special_offers on items i do not buy or need
neutral	it is taking 0_weeks to get my product once shipped .
neutral	it '_s too hard to set a regular schedule when you can '_t rely_on getting it within a certain time period .
neutral	we were very pleased with our new tempur mattress and pillows which were delivered by two really friendly and efficient delivery guys .
neutral	but we were outraged that furniture village feel it is acceptable to charge £_00 delivery charge for just 00_miles down the road !!
neutral	after complaining this charge was withdtrawn !
neutral	!
neutral	in our estimation this is not good business_practice .
neutral	i bought anno 0000 deluxe edition almost a month_ago i got my cd_key real fast everything installed and worked_perfectly .
neutral	however i still cannot find the two game soundtracks , or the 000 - page art book and the tree of technology poster .
neutral	all the extra in game features are there but nothing more .
neutral	i have emailed them about this with no response .
neutral	i give them 0_stars for customer_support and 0_stars for fast delivery .
neutral	i booked stress_free for the first time for my easter break , mainly_because they were so much_cheaper_than my normal meet & greet provider .
neutral	i was on an early flight so requested a 0am collection from the terminal when booking .
neutral	i rang them , as requested 00_mins_before i arrived at the teminal and had to ring again after 00mins waiting .
neutral	the collection driver finally arrive about 00_mins after my request time which_meant i didn_'_t have the leisurely start to my holiday i ' d anticipated .
neutral	service on the return was fine .
neutral	if you want a great price for meet and greet i ' d say stressfree are worth a try , but plan to arrive in plenty of time .
neutral	we had a good experience checking in but upon our return to newark_airport we waited a half_hour out in the cold after calling to be picked_up .
neutral	for that reason only i would think_twice about using their service again .
neutral	i purchased 0 maxi singletdress .. i received a colour i didn_'_t ask for , although happy to keep the wrong_colour im really disapointed the seams didn_'_t stay on the side after first wash before wear . hem on one was pretty bad too .
neutral	the rep was courteous and knowledgeable .
neutral	did not realize i was talking to expedia , however .
neutral	expedia '_s price was higher_than the direct hotel price given .
neutral	within about a six - hour contact time , the price given increased .
neutral	have not had that happen before .
neutral	i prefer to deal directly with the hotel corporation .
neutral	i have mixed feeling regarding paypal .
neutral	i comes sometimes handy .
neutral	but some times i get mail from paypal that my account has_been limited because of some blah_blah stuff .
neutral	printer dont work well it knows it not the right ink that its not epson_ink replacement
neutral	the service was fine and efficient but only after i had to phone to ask where order was .
neutral	the cheque had been cashed 0_weeks before and there was no notw of it on my order which was still noted as unpaid .
neutral	once this has_been clarified the goods were promptly devlived but the payment date was recorded as 00th of december and not 00th_november when cheque was cleared ( sent on 00th_november )
neutral	i have a 0000 cad .
neutral	deville .
neutral	that was the only choice for choosing the part .
neutral	it would be nice to have some measurements to choose from for cabin filters .
neutral	parts #'_s don_'_t work .
neutral	i have not been able to buy a cabin filter for my car since day 0 without paying way more then their worth and then they don_'_t have the right size .
neutral	before they hiked up their prices , they were great .
neutral	we had 0 dvd at a time with unlimited rentals and unlimited streaming for $_00 per_month and we were happy .
neutral	suddenly , it went up to $_00 per_month for this same service .
neutral	we now only have the streaming .
neutral	the streaming is nice and decently_priced at $ 0 per_month unlimited .
neutral	it is very good for kids stuff , t . v .
neutral	shows and documentaries but the movie selection is pretty limited .
neutral	have purchased from dyers before .
neutral	great selection of products ; even those hard to find ones .
neutral	purchased product arrived in a reasonable amount of time .
neutral	my problem with dyers is the high cost of their shipping .
neutral	the shipping for my product was actually more than the product itself , but i wanted the product .
neutral	when i got the products it was shoved in a box and smushed
neutral	i was excited to try a new collection of chocolates from a new company , but delivery was slow , as they make each box to order .
neutral	i ordered when i saw their guarantee , and thought that they must be pretty good to make such a claim , but i don_'_t think that they followed through .
neutral	the chocolates , whilst ok , didn_'_t live up to my expectations after what i read about the company , and i have most definitely tasted better !
neutral	i wrote an_email which i hope you have received by now ..... with pdfs of my prescriptions ......... sometimes connor is spelled with an - er but i have it correct on the scripts .
neutral	if you did not get them call me please .
neutral	i need them and i spent a fairly sizable amount of money to get the prescriptions .
neutral	i am resending my note and attachments .
neutral	joanna
neutral	dear joanna p ,
neutral	your doctor '_s office could not locate a contact_lens prescription on file for ' joanna p connor '.
neutral	would the contact_lens prescription be listed under a different name , or is there a different location that we should contact ?
neutral	thank_you ,

neutral	i have used the service quite a few_times and had been very impressed with price and service etc ..
neutral	however i made 0 trips in july / august and on the first occasion which was 00th_july as requested i phoned when 00_mins from airport the phone rang out repeatedly .
neutral	not acceptable .
neutral	i was running a bit late and due to the time of year i gambled on there being someone from the company there so i could hand the car over .
neutral	so that was stressful .
neutral	on my return i waited 00_mins .
neutral	on my most_recent return on the 00st august it was just over 00_mins this was to travel the 0 miles from where the cars are placed and was 00 . 00 on a weekday night so no traffic on m00 .
neutral	i have thought for the extra few_pounds next time i may book the car in at airport_parking .
neutral	when i was first using this service the wait was 00_mins for car return now 00 / 00_mins seems to be the norm .
neutral	maybe company becoming victims of their own success
neutral	it was clean but not great ,
neutral	while the products i ordered and received are very nice , there are a number of problems with them .
neutral	the notebooks and mousepads i ordered all arrived with white borders appearing around the outer edges .
neutral	when i spoke with customer_service , she informed me how to correct the problem ; however that was not clear on the template provided on the website .
neutral	in addition , while the template for mugs makes it appear that the photo will cover the entire mug , with the exception of the handle , it does not and is actually quite a bit smaller .
neutral	the cr rep informed me that in order to find the actual print measurements you have to look under the " help " tab .
neutral	that information should be front and center on the product design template .
neutral	the spiral binding on the notebooks is cut_off at the top and bottom leaving the wire sticking straight up and down , resulting in a nasty prick when i opened the first one .
neutral	i had to take a pair of pliers and fold the wire back on itself for all of the notebooks i ordered to prevent this from happening to someone_else .
neutral	and finally , the shipping cost for each item is very nearly as much as the item itself , i . e .
neutral	$ 0 . 00 to mail one mouse_pad .
neutral	i went to drive time , so the people there could help me out .
neutral	in obtaining a reasonable priced vehicle that i would like to drive in style , and that fits my needs and satisfaction of getting from point a to b .
neutral	good website , but order took longer to arrive than i expected
neutral	even_tho my parts were the right ones , and arived on time .
neutral	i til needed help w_/ some basic specs .
neutral	all and all i needed to talk to somone .
neutral	you need a helpline with a human , not a computer !
neutral	thankyou
neutral	you can '_t get comfy and is hard .
neutral	i just wanna sit and have it flow and be squishy .
neutral	it '_s great for animals though !
neutral	i have independent insurance cover so i did not need to take out super cover .
neutral	i told the lady on the desk this and she got quite rude and told me that i had to take it out .
neutral	i complained again when i noticed that i had been charged 0 . 00_euros a day , on return of the vehicle and got told they could not refund me the money and that i had to e_- mail firefly es .
neutral	still_waiting to receive it .
neutral	says it was shipped on jan 0 , it '_s now jan 00 and it '_s still in california .... i '_ll update if i ever receive it .
neutral	that is good price for the product i wanted .
neutral	let '_s see how the processing and shipping goes ...
neutral	i absolutely love all the clothes i ordered .
neutral	very cheap prices but decent quality .
neutral	my only issue was how long it toke to be delivered .
neutral	i waited about three_weeks for my order to arrive .
neutral	i would have given a higher rating if it wasn_'_t for that .
neutral	i enjoy learning about my credit on identity_guard , but there are major issues that i find irritating that make me want to try another company .
neutral	there are major issues at times with the website being under service or temporarily unavailable .
neutral	there were issues for months regarding the credit history for the last 00 / 00 months being unavailable .
neutral	only the 00 month option was available .
neutral	also , i find it irritating the way the company handles your credit updates from month to month .
neutral	i purposely set_up my account to update at the first of the month and now , by april , my credit_scores are unavailable until the 0th of the month ?!?
neutral	even when the site itself says you have a credit update available , the link often does not work .
neutral	this was explained to me by a representative at the call_center who told me that since i logged in at 0 : 00_pm on the 0st of march , i need to wait_until 0 : 00_pm on the 0th of april in order to get a credit update .
neutral	it made sense to them , but not me .
neutral	somehow because february was a short month i need to wait_until the 0th for an update .
neutral	also , the representatives at the call_center seem to be reading scripts or texting someone while they are talking to you .
neutral	i never feel_like they have heard my concern or bothered to try to solve issues .
neutral	hi .
neutral	i placed my order on 00th of may and still did not recive it .
neutral	i have contacted you and have been told it should be with me already .
neutral	it was a few_days ago and still nothing .
neutral	with regards
neutral	marta rozumiejko
neutral	i like to order pet needs like food on a monthly_basis .
neutral	it '_s like a no think no forget plan .
neutral	unfortunately the food is more_expensive than my local_petsmart sales which it always seems like my brand is on sale plus i earn $ 0 coupons almost monthly due to the amount i spend there making my food cheaper and my loyalty stronger and leaving the convince of mail order as not an option .
neutral	i really like the socks .
neutral	they are good in color , comfy to wear but one of them developed a small_hole adjacent to the stitching for the size label .
neutral	if there were no label , i would have rated them a 0 .
neutral	received the dog_food i ordered very quickly .... only problem is , i emailed the company with a problem i had with their website and the pay / groupon code ... still have not heard back from them one week_later -- i '_m afraid that once they have my money , they are not interested in helping_me
neutral	improve customer_service .
neutral	i was very skeptical_about booking with skytours .
neutral	there reviews online were very mixed .
neutral	having said that , i purchased my tickets online and went to the airport at said date and received tickets .
neutral	everything went well including appropriate waiting times etc_., however when i boarded one of my connections the security officer pulled me from the lined as he was scanning my ticket to board the plane .
neutral	after asking me a few questions he said that there were problems with my ticket .
neutral	he said that i could still board the plane but that i probably should not book with sky - tours again .
neutral	i had to make several calls to get status of my purchase and delivery .
neutral	on the day of the delivery , i called again to confirm if i was to receive a call before the delivery truck arrival to ensure that i am home when my item is delivered .
neutral	i was told that i will get a call 00 - 00mins before arrival ; no calls .
neutral	the delivery_men however were nice enough to put my items in the garage instead of leaving it on the driveway as i am pregnant and rain was expected that day .
neutral	the items are still in the boxes as i am moving so i decided to wait_until i get to my new house before unpacking .
neutral	i received my order in a reasonable amount of time after i ordered it , but the two 00 packs of canned_food i ordered were at_least 00_% comprised of dented_cans .
neutral	i have a hard time believing that shipping alone caused so many of the cans to be so dented , so i have to assume they started out like that .
neutral	the toys and vitamins i ordered were fine and packaging was intact and unmarred .
neutral	i am still_waiting for a problem to be sorted dispute contacting you twice !
neutral	!
neutral	this website is nice but i don_'_t like the fact that i don_'_t know if an item is in stock until i '_ve actually made the payment .
neutral	it '_s somewhat of a disappointment when you '_ve paired items to wear as a whole and then one item isn_'_t there .
neutral	i '_ve ordered quite a few items on wowcher from clothes to curries .
neutral	the food has_been great quality but i can '_t always say the same for the clothes .
neutral	the price at which the recent wizard of oz tickets was seriously misleading .
neutral	great transfers , but if you live in ireland , be prepared to be stung , by customs and excise
neutral	the website is not friendly for changing items set_up for automatic delivery .
neutral	also , want to cancel a delivery ?
neutral	impossible to do on the website ... a message pips up telling_me i need to call .
neutral	that , combined with how some products can be found cheaper elsewhere make it so i want to cancel .
neutral	however , customer_service for exchanges is excellent , and all my cat '_s favorite foods are at this site in the sizes i like .
neutral	took the full 00 days and it was frustrating as i see many of the other_reviewers complaints .
neutral	my issue now is the iphone i was unlocking ( mine ) was supposed to leave with my son for europe .
neutral	since it took so long he has since left the usa .
neutral	since we all know how bad customer_service is ; i would like to know if i can still unlock my phone with its current att sim .
neutral	i dont have another sim_card from another carrier .
neutral	if anyone can help me ... that would be wonderful .
neutral	anybody have a suggestion ?
neutral	i hate for the money to go down the drain !
neutral	we ordered parts for our car after a car / deer accident that could be repaired at home .
neutral	although the prices are great , we did alot of searching and comparing , i must_say that you get what you pay for .
neutral	parts were indeed shipped quickly , however , parts came in random boxes , no packing lists and not all there .
neutral	the response from partsgeek is that they would look into it , but basically it '_s out of their hands because they are not the shippers , so it seems .
neutral	they must in turn follow_up with the actual company that shipped the specific parts .
neutral	they made it my responsibility to follow_up with them to check on the status of our missing parts .
neutral	i feel that i did my part , i entrusted them with not only my money but choosing them for my large order ( this wasn_'_t just penny pieces ) and am greatly disappointed that not only are getting no where fast on the part we need , but that i have to be the one that cares that i did not receive my items .
neutral	in the meantime , my car sits , waiting to get put back together .
neutral	will not order from this company again , will trust my time and money to a company that i already know and trust .
neutral	easy_comforts is an average website for purchasing hard to find items .
neutral	the reason i give it an average score is because they do not have a " gift " option on checkout .
neutral	the shipping is a little_slow as well .
neutral	sometimes the item is not too good of quality but overall they will try to work with you .
neutral	took_ages for each_stage to be completed .
neutral	payment was very slow .
neutral	the customer_service was extremely_helpful .
neutral	he walked through all the options and suggested cost savings .
neutral	the website was very easy to use and i could visualize the design on the shirt and color options were terrific .
neutral	the color printed were true to my logo .
neutral	i would give 0_stars if the screen print quality was better .
neutral	the shirt showed through the print .
neutral	i arrived in phoenix without a map or gps .
neutral	i needed a paper map and a person_who was proficient in giving directions .
neutral	the person_who checked me out of the budget rental_car area at sky harbor assumed that i knew how to get to my destination .
neutral	please be sure that all of your employees who have contact with customers are able to give excellent directions .
neutral	example , the employee said " take i - 00 east to 00nd street exit .
neutral	then take that all the way down "
neutral	i asked him to tell me the simple turns , example_: turn left at the top of the ramp .
neutral	right on buckeye , you will exit buckeye onto i - 00 in a few blocks , take i - 00 e to 00nd street exit .
neutral	turn right , then stay on the street until you see 0000 s 00nd street
neutral	i find that so many people do not know how to give simple , complete directions .
neutral	they need to use right and left , number of blocks or miles , directions of the compass .
neutral	please retrain and retest your employees on this matter .
neutral	thank_you

neutral	i
neutral	my parents are watercolor artists , and i thought that making stamps of their favorite paintings would be a great gift idea .
neutral	i was pleased that you could choose a color theme to match the images .
neutral	i was not pleased because of the singular format choice : square ( most paintings are rectangular ).
neutral	the shipping time estimate was accurate , about 0 - 0 days , but they failed to mention that it may take a week or more to process your order before shipping .
neutral	in the end i got what i ' d wanted , but i would have been happier with a faster processing time and a rectangular format option .
neutral	i booked one apartment and the host informed me about additional cleaning fee , which was not mentioned in the description of the apartment .
neutral	as there was no possibility for the owner to cancel the fee , i decided to cancel the reservation .
neutral	even_though it was not at all my fault ( no information about the fee was in the description ) housetrip made me pay some_sort of fee for canceling the booking .
neutral	i think this is not acceptable - either you have to watch your hosts so that the information on their websites are valid , or you can '_t expect people to pay for your mistakes .
neutral	the rest went well , but i would hesitate before recomending housetrip to a friend .
neutral	i had trouble with the name used to make the reservation matching with spirit_airlines .
neutral	i was checking into the purchase of baggage before my flight and things just were not matching up .
neutral	took a very long frustrating time until things matched .
neutral	if would be nice to have some toll_free phone numbers to be able to call either at travelocity or the airlines .
neutral	i booked a hotel through olotels months in advance .... being the paranoid person i am , i called the hotel to verify the booking ( the price of the hotel was too good to be true so i thought it was a scam ).
neutral	the hotel hadn_'_t received my booking yet so naturally i panicked and contacted olotels who then reassured me that i am in fact booked at the hotel .
neutral	fast forward to the day of my reservation , as i was waiting to board my plane , i called the hotel again to verify ( i was still skeptical )... to which they again had said there was no booking .
neutral	i immediately called olotels , the agent said they would look into it and call back .
neutral	he was great !
neutral	the agent only had 00_mins_before i got on a plane to sort it out for me and he did .
neutral	he apologized for the error and even provided the hotel confirmation #.
neutral	as much work as that was for myself , i don_'_t mind taking the time to make the calls for my own sanity .
neutral	if i hadn_'_t called the hotel_directly , i would have shown up at the hotel at 00pm without a room .
neutral	i would only recommend this hotel if you are willing to take the same steps as i did ....
neutral	i dont like having to spend $_00 . 00 for a special lock that only works there .
neutral	rip_off !
neutral	$_00 . 00 fee !
neutral	!
neutral	it is much more difficult to make reservations than it used to be .
neutral	it is not helpful to have all the other reservation sites show up .
neutral	i used to be able to see the airline options clearly , but not any more .
neutral	it is easier to go to the airline sites .
neutral	i did start receiving applicants almost right_away however the caliber of the people did not meet the standards for my business .
neutral	i did hire 0 of the applicants and they are in training now .
neutral	i always like boohoo dresses , they ' re so pretty but i always have to get a size or two up from what i buy in shops .
neutral	why so skinny boohoo ?
neutral	?
neutral	other than the shipping taking almost 0_weeks , i loved everything that i purchased !
neutral	and i really loved the prices !
neutral	i ordered 0 items from pmtc about 0_weeks before i actually had to have them in - hand .
neutral	the ordering process was easy and everything seemed to be going along well , but then days passed and there was no news about my shipment .
neutral	i finally emailed the company to check on my order and was given a response to contact a specific person at pmtc .
neutral	when i called , i was told they were busy and had to leave a voicemail .
neutral	i called again later when i hadn_'_t gotten a response and the person in question was rude and stated " they didn_'_t even know why i was contacting them specifically ".
neutral	it seems my order was filled and just sat around the warehouse waiting to be shipped , and at_least they did offer to ship next_day ( an upgrade ) when they finally did ship it out .
neutral	i have no_complaints with the actual products or pricing offered by pigeon_mountain .
neutral	the slow processing and nasty personal demeanor will certainly make me think_twice before buzzing past their catalog again .
neutral	this product was better_than my normal deodrant , but i expected it to keep me totally dry , but it didn_'_t .
neutral	i don_'_t normally sweat badly , but since starting the menopause , this is becoming more of an_issue , so i was hoping that this product would work better_than it does .
neutral	in saying that , i will keep using it for the time being , because as already menttioned , it keeps me dryer than my usual deodrant .
neutral	very expensive for the amount ( size ) of items .
neutral	i like the fact that the process was easy but the quality of the shoes wad poor .
neutral	this premier_inn is good value , with a great location being steps only from the terminal .
neutral	its also surprisingly comfortable and quiet .
neutral	however , on turning up to eat at the restaurant i was told i would have to wait 0 hours for a table and given no alternative suggestions for dining .
neutral	it was only on leaving the hotel ( with my 0 kids in tow ) to find somewhere i could feed my hungry children , that i asked a member of the reception team where i could get food for the children that i was told i could order food from the bar .
neutral	i was appalled that i was sent away from the restaurant without being told this especailly as the hostess could see i had two children to feed .
neutral	very unacceptable .
neutral	when we eventually queued at the bar for food for 00_minutes , the food came fairly quickly ( another 00 - 00_minutes ) but was of below average quality .
neutral	kids chicken curry was inedible .
neutral	i would recommend this hotel for the accomodation but do everything to avoid the food if possible .
neutral	the tickets were over 000 . 00 dollars each for a flight from new_york to fort_lauderdale .
neutral	when i went to print the boarding_passes , i was asked to pay for the carry - ons and then the seats !!
neutral	!
neutral	wrong part delivered ... ok ... it happens .
neutral	but 00_hours to rectify ... not acceptable .
neutral	i '_ll be happy when this transaction is over !
neutral	i ordered the wrong parts and when i called in i had a difficult time reaching anyone .
neutral	i sent in a ticket specifically asking for someone to call me and i was not called .
neutral	very disappointed with the level of customer_service .
neutral	i received a response via_email where they needed more information and replied and never received a response from there .
neutral	very disappointed .
neutral	i love kavinace but the recent price increases are forcing me to find a new sleep aide .
neutral	my first order with animed_direct , the price was very competitive , but with a few delivery issues .
neutral	initially the order disappeared into a black hole , but on telephoning quickly resolved and item delivered by courier - although again delayed_due to addressing errors twith courier - order took over a week to arrive but on receipt the items were fine and i would certainly try and order again .
neutral	the item was a good price and delivered quickly .
neutral	however part of the item was damaged , to be fair i got a 00_% refund very promptly once i emailed them , however maybe they could rethink their packaging .
neutral	sizing is slightly incorrect too , i ordered a small which it says on the website is a uk 0 - 00 , however it is slightly too baggy to be an 0 - 00 .
neutral	the local rental_car companies here in cork , ireland do not recognize my american insurance , so i must purchase excess cover or allow them to put as much as 0000 euro hold on my credit_card .
neutral	argus_car_hire online system has a " purchase excess cover " option that is very cheap ( 0 euros total ), however , what they do not tell is that this " excess cover " purchase is not really coverage , it is only for " reimbursement " of any out of pocket expense should i have an accident with the rental_car .
neutral	i was informed of this by the rental_car company and the end_result is that i must pay twice for " excess cover " that was implied to be purchased online .
neutral	a very sneaky ploy on the part of argus .
neutral	i have used hostelworld for about five bookings at this point .
neutral	four out of five went_smoothly with no_complaints .
neutral	one hostel i booked and received an_email a few_days_later .
neutral	the email was from the hostel and said hostelworld had overbooked when there was no vacancy and i should contact them for my deposit back .
neutral	i have tried to call and have sent three emails to hostelworld .
neutral	i have had no responses .
neutral	their office is in ireland which is difficult to reach by phone when i live in south_america .
neutral	i have mix feelings about their system now .
neutral	do i want to risk things going wrong with no response again ?
neutral	you can decide for yourself .
neutral	i wanted to request a room near the elevator & to choose only 0 guest , but i never saw a place to do that .
neutral	i had to call customer_service in order to request the room and they could not guarantee that .
neutral	i didn_'_t like the idea that as soon as i opened the location website it automatically went to this booking site .
neutral	was ok but glasses werent exactly as i expected but thats what you get if you use mail order
neutral	i gave the site a go today and was really impressed with the beautiful bouquets on offer !
neutral	my only issue was with the checkout_process - i got error codes when trying to pay by paypal , when i was trying to look up the shipping address by postcode , and also really struggled to find the promotional_code box as it '_s not part of the checkout_process .
neutral	after manually putting in the address and opting for debit_card vs paypal , i got there eventually !
neutral	it hasn_'_t done nothing for my husband he '_s ocd is still bad
neutral	i ordered the cressi sky snorkel set for our 0 year_old_son .
neutral	the set was great and arrived when expected .
neutral	simply snorkle stated on their web_site that they could not guarantee that the colour of the set would be as featured in the product photo .
neutral	unfortunately any other colour would have been fine but we could not use the set for our son as it arrived in pink .
neutral	please address this maybe include a separate order option for pink .
neutral	in every delivery , the cases are damages , as well as several cans .
neutral	it appears the packages are being handled with little concern .
neutral	bought my family of 00 tickets online before travelling to paris , 00 of us got on a bus with no_problems at le louvre , however my disabled father in law accompanied_by my husband were refused entry on two buses even_though they had the confirmation_email .
neutral	this was really upsetting and meant that they had to sit in a bus_stop to shelter from the pouring_rain until he was able to make it back to our vehicle where they spent the remainder of the day waiting for us .
neutral	it ruined our trip and prevented him from realising his dream of seeing the parisian sights .
neutral	a very disappointing day :(
neutral	i requested a lower radiator hose and you sent me the upper radiator hose .
neutral	i went to pep_boys to get the lower hose and replaced the upper hose .
neutral	i had no_intention of replacing the upper hose .
neutral	but everything is cool .
neutral	the composite type boards used to re - floor our deck is turning upward at some of the joints and creating a tripping hazard .
neutral	the flooring boards were all screwed down originally , but that is not keeping the involved boards flat and even .
neutral	everything '_s fine with the delivery system and deals that you offer .
neutral	the problem for my last three deliveries has_been that the 00 . 0 ounce canned_food that i '_ve purchased has arrived with bent bottoms , sides , or lids .
neutral	they are packed in lots of a dozen , but somehow the packing isn_'_t strong_enough , so many cans are bent or otherwise damaged on arrival .
neutral	hopefully , this doesn_'_t affect the contents , but it sure makes it difficult to open with a can opener that isn_'_t a crow bar !
neutral	the first time i ordered with mr . chewy , my stuff arrived about a week_later which is okay .
neutral	the next time i ordered with mr . chewy , i noticed the website claimed 0 day shipping .
neutral	when it took a week for my stuff to come in , i was a little miffed .
neutral	i don_'_t like to be lied too .
neutral	if you can '_t give me 0 day shipping , just say so .
neutral	it '_s okay if it means it helps you keep your cost down .
neutral	just down lie .
neutral	the clams 00_% broke and 0 lobster was dead :(
neutral	i like the reasonable prices , but it '_s hard to contact the company .
neutral	i have tried_calling , submitting a ticket , ( which won_'_t go through ) and u faxed the company no response .
neutral	i recite bed the wrong part .
neutral	i ordered the weight_loss patches and they did not stick they did call and told me they would not charge me for them but as yet i have not seen a credit issued .
neutral	so i am not real happy with their product
neutral	it '_s easy to book and the options presented are great .
neutral	but even_though you enter the frequent flier # when booking on travelocity , it never carries over to the actual reservation with the airline so i always have to call the airline and wait forever on hold to add it .
neutral	it '_s a pain and the main_reason i usually book direct with the airline .
neutral	this is a very basic flight need .
neutral	what is up ?
neutral	furthermore , my seat reservations were not saved for the second leg of the journey .
neutral	now the options are much worse .
neutral	because there is so much competition on line , and so many pet_supply sites , i shop price and delivery costs .
neutral	this was my first time shopping at petflow .... i found that the shipping was much slower_than other_sites i have used for pet_food .
neutral	this was my only_complaint , but , unless they deliver the food more quickly , i probably will not shop there again .
neutral	i booked the room online .
neutral	when i arrived i could not use my aaa_discount card or my senior_citizen discount .
neutral	that was very disappointing .
neutral	those discounts would have saved my several dollars .
neutral	had to stay because rooms were not available at other_places
neutral	very quick service , however , each of the 0 cartridges i opened to install leaked an inordinate amount of ink on to my hands and the desk !
neutral	!
neutral	very poor finishing .
neutral	i wish someone would have advised . me that i would need . other parts .
neutral	no bulbs or replacement sockets were attached .
neutral	no i have to order and wait before i can repair my tail_lights ..
neutral	i knew the bulbs wouldn_'_t be there .
neutral	but sockets !
neutral	?!
neutral	unhappy ...
neutral	can '_t get through to the phone_number they provide and it just says to call back later .
neutral	no one responds to our emails even_though they claim to respond within 00_hours ?
neutral	still_haven_'_t received an update on the order i placed 0_weeks_ago .
neutral	apart_from that , they do have a good variety of stock and at relatively good prices .
neutral	i was disappointed with the inflexibility of delivery and also the expectation that 0 people were available to help unload .
neutral	i haven_'_t had the goods installed yet and i know there will be no comeback if something is wrong .
neutral	i booked a " deal " without knowing the name of the hotel .
neutral	it said that two stars are best_western , hampton_inn , la_quinta .
neutral	instead of those types of hotels , i was booked into a super 0 .
neutral	not the same category .
neutral	very disappointing .
neutral	i won_'_t likely book a deal without exact hotel name and location again .
neutral	:(
neutral	i once ordered pick_up from truly vegan .
neutral	when i went to the place , it was closed .
neutral	i was not offered anything for the inconvenience of going to get the food when the place was closed .
neutral	when trying to order from two boots pizza , it was not easy to pick certain things like type of crust etc .
neutral	it wasn_'_t very user - friendly .
neutral	having previously had good experiences , i sent my mother some flowers a few_months_ago to cheer_her up and when they arrived they were great but the next_day they were already dying and on day three most had to be binned .
neutral	thinking this was a one off , i sent her some flowers for mothers_day and i upgraded them to the ' deluxe ' version .
neutral	my mother found them on the doorstep when a second bunch from my brother turned_up .
neutral	so , the delivery person didn_'_t knock .
neutral	when i went round to see her i was very surprised to find her flowers were a t very ' petit ' bunch .
neutral	not at all what i was expecting .
neutral	next time i will use the company my brother used , as his flowers filled the house , lasted_longer and didn_'_t cost as much .
neutral	i use to get my orders in a couple days but lately it has_been slower and slower .
neutral	my order from a week_ago today has_been sitting at fedex ten miles from my house for several days accordiing to the website .
neutral	i stopped using my old dog_food company because they were too slow , and you all were great someone needs to findout why it is now taking so long to receive orders .
neutral	purchases are easy but when they have to be delivered i have to constantly chase to get it delivered .
neutral	flowers arrived and i was told they were lovely .
neutral	the problem was that the card was blank which caused a problem as recipient did not know who they were from .
neutral	when i called the lady cpnfirmed that a message was on the system she just said she would call florist .
neutral	no offer of anything_else not great customer_service
neutral	i renewed my multitrip_insurance no prob payed by laser card . all was grand . i had to inform the medical board as i do every year that my husband is diabtic . there is never extra_charge however i was told this year things have changed and there would be a charge of 00 . euro and 00cent . ok thats no big deal i said ill pay with laser and was told they dont except laser only credit_card or cheque hers the thig we don_'_t have a credit_card or cheque book and your man says ask a family_member if you can use their card . its a discrace they were happy to take my money from laser card for main policy
neutral	i '_m editing my review to reflect what my experience has_been since our case was taken up by michael , the president of nsc .
neutral	my fiance and i did have a number of difficulties with our order with this company ( they are listed at the very bottom of this review ), but our opinion has changed drastically since we were able to work with michael .
neutral	our belief is that the vast_majority of people who work with nsc receive a perfect order on the first go around and that when our order had problems , their existing infrastructure was really not adequate to deal with them .
neutral	now , i will say that i hope our rep has learned a lesson about how to treat customers because we were quite understanding and had very simple requests that she chose not to follow_up on ( emailing us when it arrived , calling us once it was time to re - do the ring for the third time , and making sure to look at the ring herself before it was shipped out ).
neutral	that said , our experience with michael has absolutely been perfect .
neutral	not only was he incredibly apologetic over the phone to both my fiance and myself , individually , he also asked us both individually to explain exactly_what had happened from our personal perspectives and really took the time to express to us how much he regretted what our experience had been .
neutral	he offered us a 00_%_discount on our ring in addition to providing a written lifetime_guarantee that we could send the ring back to be re - finished for no charge and also guaranteed that if we decided to change the band from platinum to white gold at some point in the future that his company would remake the band and refund us the difference in the costs of the metal .
neutral	we chose not to accept the discount , though we appreciated that it was offered , because we never wanted to pay less for our ring -- we just wanted what we had ordered and we wanted someone at the company to care about us and our ring .
neutral	we wanted to feel_like we were being treated like people by someone_who cared .
neutral	once we got in touch with michael -- which we did on our first try this past monday -- things were taken_care of incredibly quickly .
neutral	in fact , i am wearing my ring right now ( it arrived last night along with a beautiful pendant necklace that michael sent to apologize ) and it looks perfect .
neutral	i now regret that we spent so much time dealing_with our rep and realize that we should have taken it higher up the chain much sooner .
neutral	in spite of our frustrations , i still support this company because it is a small business and i really believe our experience was a reflection of the fact that it is experiencing growing pains .
neutral	i '_m sure our rep had tons of other orders she was dealing_with and i really think that our experience was a wake_up call for the company that they need to grow their staff in order to take on increasing demand .
neutral	i really hope that no one else will have to deal with what we did , but at the end of the day we now have the ring that we wanted and we have the comfort of knowing that michael is supporting us and is on our side .
neutral	it '_s kind of funny how much it matters for purchases like engagement_rings to be sure that the people you ' re buying from care not just about the money you '_ll be giving them , but about you .
neutral	i '_m leaving the basics of my original review below so that other customers can see what our experience was .
neutral	still , i am greatly comforted in having spoken with michael personally and i am certain that this is a company with strong potential and with beautiful pieces to offer .
neutral	i hope that my review will be an anomaly and that the company can learn and grow from our experience .
neutral	my only advice would be that if other customers begin to face difficulties ( which , again , i don_'_t_believe many do based on other reviews and also based on michael '_s reaction , calling our experience " his worst nightmare " and expressing his embarrassment ) they should make_sure to elevate their order themselves .
neutral	0 .
neutral	we ordered a ring but they had to ship it undone because it was not completed in time for our engagement .
neutral	we understood and sent it back to be finished an re - sized .
neutral	our rep then sent it back and it was finished , but they did not re - size it .
neutral	frustrated , we sent it back again .
neutral	when we got it back it was re - sized but extremely dirty ( black spots all over ) and misshapen .
neutral	this has led to me having a ring for about 0_weeks of our engagement of over 0 months .
neutral	frustrating .
neutral	0 .
neutral	our rep was generally quite dismissive .
neutral	when i would send my precious ring back to their store , i would ask her to inform me when it arrived .
neutral	each time i sent it back ( via 0 - day shipping ) i had to contact her myself ( five days_later ) to ask if the ring had arrived .
neutral	the third time i asked that she call me to speak with me over the phone about my ring .
neutral	she agreed she would .
neutral	she never did .
neutral	she also repeatedly used the excuse that she had many appointments and meetings to justify not calling me .
neutral	* i have learned by talking to michael that their reps do not work on commission so as to avoid situations like ours happening .
neutral	as such , i have deleted what i had previously written about our rep dismissing us perhaps because she had already received her commission .
neutral	still_waiting for a response to my e_- mail from some time ago regarding the negative behavior or your telephone order taker .
neutral	the offers that where dispatch where great value for money but sometimes the product you wish to purchase does not tell you the date you can use it by which comes across as misleading which is a shame it makes me hesitate to book a hotel offer in future .
neutral	overall in the past i have been pleased with the wowchers i have purchased and i have bought a lot !!
neutral	however i was disappointed that a gift i bought for my daughter as a christmas_present and which she could not take adfvantage of within the dates are causing her a problem in redeeming .
neutral	i think she has only been offered a percentage of the money spent rather_than just transfer the full value to another wowcher experience .
neutral	we have never asked for a refund and cannot understand wowcher '_s stance on this .
neutral	this meabs i will not give wowcher experiences as a gift in the future and would not recommend that anyone_else does .
neutral	my tyres had not arrived at the garage at the time i had booked in for .
neutral	i have still not received a refund for the initial deposit i paid - though i have been told this will happen .
neutral	i managed to get alternative tyres at a cheaper price locally .
neutral	however , blackcircles have been very good at getting back to me whenever i have called or emailed , and were happy to cancel my order immediately as the tyres had not been delivered in time .
neutral	the assos factory outlet is hit and miss .
neutral	i found a great umajacket in a never before seen color ( pink and blk ), that arrived in perfect_condition and true to size .
neutral	love it !
neutral	on the other hand , they have jersey '_s listed over a $_000 more then i would pay ( on sale - same jersey ), at my regular cycle shopping website , so not exactly outlet pricing !
neutral	but let the buyer_beware .
neutral	the reason i gave them a 0 was for the bib tights i bought .
neutral	the bib attachment broke before i ever left the house and the length of the bib straps are shorter then the same pair i purchased from my regular shopping site .
neutral	seems the sizing is off on the entire fit for this particular peice , maybe the reason it is at the outlet in the first place , but still would not expect the bib closure to tear off in under 00_minutes .
neutral	did not return as the policy is too difficult , i just sewed them .
neutral	again buyer_beware !
neutral	still love assos , but hesitant to buy from their outlet unless its one of those colors the regular stores don_'_t carry and i can '_t live wotihout !
neutral	we booked a ' greet & meet ' service as our flight was returning late , we called to confirm that we had landed and was asked to call again once we collected our_luggage , even after the second call we had to wait about 00_mins for the driver to turn up .
neutral	i expect meet and greet to be literally when you walk out of the terminal .
neutral	i will write a review when we receive the item .
neutral	shipoing seems to be slow
neutral	the website is easy to navigate , and it '_s awesome that the provide measurements for their clothes , especially for international costumers .
neutral	that said , while their selection of clothes is pretty broad , their actual stock is shit .
neutral	i wanted to exchange an item for a smaller_size , but it was already sold out , even_though i received it not even a week_ago .
neutral	what clothe items i save for later also end up being " no_longer available " within a week or two .
neutral	costumer_service isn_'_t the best either .
neutral	i called to ask about returns , but their hours are weird , and all i got was an_automated_message with bad audio and broken english .
neutral	i tried e_- mailing them instead , and again , i just got another automated_message , a day or two later .
neutral	i was told when i called that no one knew when the back ordered items would be in .
neutral	not good .
neutral	i went to make my payment at the wood forest location and their computer was down .
neutral	i understand things happen so the clerk suggested two locations the federal rd .
neutral	location and another about a mile from that .
neutral	i went to the federal rd .
neutral	because it was closer .
neutral	when i arrived there their computer was also down and that was at_least a 0 mile drive . i gave up after that . since the systems are totally computer driven some other accommodations should be made for customers so that they ' re not inconvience .
neutral	good selection , competitive_prices , shame delivery charges are so high
neutral	and not delivered quicker .
neutral	i had no_idea i wasn_'_t dealing directly with the hotel .
neutral	that was deceiving .
neutral	andafter reading all this reviews i was so scared about my order .
neutral	i just ordered 0 pairs of shoes and to my surprise i got everything i orderd all came in on time and im pretty happy with all of them .
neutral	so i would say give it and see what happens
neutral	your 0000 people do not know any information .
neutral	i was told to go to the property to ask because when i called the fort worth location in river oaks , they did not answer the phone for two_days over different times .
neutral	you seem very disorganized .
neutral	reasonable pricing , however , felt harassed .
neutral	i thought my due date was the 00th of each_month .
neutral	the first month was free .
neutral	then , the second month i waited to pay my bill , however , i received a past due notice around the second week with a late charge .
neutral	i went into the office and told the manager i thought he had told me it was due on the 00th and could he waive the late charge .
neutral	he said " no ."
neutral	i then planned to call the site manager in the next few_days but , in the meantime , received in the mail a notice of lien with even more additional_charges !
neutral	:( to make a long_story short , i ended_up paying 00 . extra in charges that i feel were unwarranted .
neutral	i '_m only still there because i don_'_t want to go through the hassle of moving again .
neutral	first , my property was stolen from a public_storage_unit and it took them 0 months to pay me ... now this .
neutral	not happy .
neutral	the website is a bit busy , but was easy to navigate .
neutral	i added a package of products that touted free_shipping on entire order , but was still charged $ 0 . 00 shipping anyway .
neutral	it isn_'_t a whole lot , but if you say free_shipping , you should mean free_shipping .
neutral	so , i only give 0_stars .
neutral	i may be able to update my review to 0_stars once i receive my order .
neutral	until then , i remain hopefully optimistic that there are no other quirks .
neutral	because , they do have great prices and lots of freebies to add in to your order .
neutral	i love a great value !
neutral	my family and i really_enjoyed getting on the bus at waterloo , the guide was very upbeat and had great knowledge of london .
neutral	waiting for 00_minutes at stop number 0 was frustrating , we were told the wait would be 00_minutes at the most .
neutral	when the new guide got on the bus she was very good and informative .
neutral	my son fell down the stairs when we tried to get off the bus which upset him and made me anxious for our return_journey .
neutral	when we got back on the bus outside hamleys , the bus was very full and there was no guide for the rest of the tour .
neutral	that was disappointing .
neutral	first time ordering from diabloskinz and i was very happy with the great print .
neutral	would have been really happy if they could have sent me both items i paid for instead of only 0 .
neutral	still_waiting for satisfaction and a response ...
neutral	hi there , this was a great product but from the time i paid for it , it took two_weeks to get to me , this was too slow i felt , there was good communication with lots of emails every_step of the way , however , normal online sale is pay for it and it is sent the same day .
neutral	great product , packed well
neutral	i ordered from groupon packaging was good meat i would say iv had better .
neutral	i would like to tell people i also received another package of meat 0 week_later which i did not order .
neutral	the amount £_00_pounds in which i did not order .
neutral	i got an_email from the company stating i was ordering a weekly food package deal ... no i didn_'_t maybe that '_s how they get there money back .
neutral	did this happen to anybody else and no i was not refunded ..
neutral	i would beware
neutral	in 0000 , i ordered a self - styled plaque and it was wonderful .
neutral	it is 0 / 0 " thick .
neutral	it was a good gift for an established / wealthy friend .
neutral	in 0000 i ordered another and it is half the thickness for the same price .
neutral	i am very disappointed .
neutral	the second plaque looks cheesy and low rent next to the first .
neutral	i will not be ordering again .
neutral	they have a wide_variety of wound care products at good prices .
neutral	they charge 00 . 00 for shipping regardless of what you order .
neutral	i thought this was a little_steep for probably less_than a pound of gauze sponges .
neutral	one of the items i ordered has not been received and there was not really an explanation of why or when it would come .
neutral	i got the other items last_week .
neutral	we '_ve had verizon for years !
neutral	we purchased the iphone from them , but the next week a new one came out , and they didn_'_t inform us of that !
neutral	the selling of my first phone was fine but unfortunately there was a difficultly with the sellign of my blackberry and i have not recived the phone back yet as it couldnt not be sold so i am slighty annoyed by this
neutral	a couple of times when i '_ve needed to make_changes , or correct an_error , the service couldn_'_t have been better !
neutral	and anything i order usually arrives in 0 days , or 0 max , so awesome there !
neutral	my complaint would be that the food is about $ 0 -$ 0 more than at a local_retail_store , and add to that the shipping ( don_'_t like to spend the extra $$ on stuff i don_'_t need just for free_shipping ), sooooo , all together i pay nearly $_00 extra for home delivery .
neutral	it '_s good for when i '_m working too much to be able to catch the store when it '_s open .
neutral	but there '_s a lot i could do with $_00 .....
neutral	this service was convenient though there was some initial confusion and i wasn_'_t happy that funds were taken from my account even_though my initial host declined my request .
neutral	i wasn_'_t aware that i would have to request my money back or instruct them to put it towards another property as i thought it would be automatic .
neutral	i may use again but will also investigate other_companies_offering similar services .
neutral	the labels are not exactly_what i thought they would be but will work for what i need .
neutral	i thought they would be cloth but are more like a plastic material .
neutral	i did not realize they were ' iron on ' but i stitched it on anyway .
neutral	i don_'_t think an iron on label would hold up on a baby '_s blanket .
neutral	they are worth the price .
neutral	the staff is friendly , clean room , but to high price for what they offer .
neutral	breakfest is not included , ok , extra 00_euro .
neutral	but for that price a expect a special breakfest , this was good but basic .
neutral	the same for wifi , if you want it , extra 0 euro .
neutral	the week before i stayed in an hostel , breakfest the same as in the hotel , free_wifi ,...
neutral	at a mutch lower price .
neutral	priceline has gotten us some very fair deals but every so often they will slip in a very poor hotel on their express_deals .
neutral	they tell you the type of hotel you can " expect " with the deal they are offering and then slip in a hotel that isn_'_t listed and then say " no refunds " ... too bad , so sad is their line then .
neutral	i would love to know what my product is like , but i haven_'_t gotten it yet : )
neutral	the deals are very good and i have bought quite a few goods and meals .
neutral	however , some goods had a very short timescale to claim or it wasn_'_t clear they needed claiming rather sending direct , so i have lost money on a number or purchases which is extremely frustrating .
neutral	as i have used the site for some time this isn_'_t because i don_'_t know how to use the site .
neutral	the goods i have received have all been good quality and arrived as expected .
neutral	i received my bag extremely quick .
neutral	i appreciated the timely delivery .
neutral	however after using my bag for a month the top clasp no_longer will hold the hook .
neutral	every time i put an item on my hook the weight rips it out of the clasp .
neutral	i '_m disappointed in how quickly the clasp had broken .
neutral	i expected better from this company .
neutral	where did the discount you promised in the email vanish ?
neutral	the delivery of orders is not consistent .
neutral	sometimes the order is here in 0 days and the last order was 0 days in delivery .
neutral	it was a one item order and was shipped the same day so why did it take so long ?
neutral	the pop_up discounts are hard to manage when ordering as i plan to redeem points and then there is another discount option and it is not made know until the order is almost done .
neutral	it would be important to know up front what the discount options will be so a decision about the items to order can be made .
neutral	the graphics on the card were perfect .
neutral	the proposed shipping took longer_than it was supposed to and the tracking_number brought me to the wrong site .
neutral	but the receipient received her gift_card and she '_s happy !
neutral	you did a great job in terms of trying to build a good relationship with us , but overall i came away feeling things were a bit disorganized and so things weren_'_t on time quite_often .
neutral	it looked like things were going to get better with website improvements etc .
neutral	but we ended_up going with another company that was cheaper and uses dropbox for transcription audio upload which makes_life_easier .
neutral	delivery was slow nd one of the items came damaged
neutral	a button fell_off one dress as soon as i tried it on .
neutral	i ordered a skater dress and one of the belt loops came off on that .
neutral	i however had no_problems with the tight body con dresses .
neutral	i purchased 00 " bully_sticks " for my dogs and they absolutely love them .
neutral	i also purchased two ( 0 ) monkey kong toys , believing them to be durable as_described .
neutral	within about 0 minutes of having them , one dog chewed open the head of the toy and then removed the squeaker .
neutral	as far as i '_m concerned these toys were a waste of our money .
neutral	the site is easy to use and with helpful advice on measuring etc .
neutral	the service and delivery were good .
neutral	the only_drawback and its a big one ... ordered a blackout material for pleated blinds and instead of running strings through loops attached to the fabric the strings are run through the blind making the blackout material a laugh as there are 0 lines of holes all the way down each blind .
neutral	its a real_shame as otherwise i like the product .
neutral	managed muck up my order and selected quantity 0 of the wrong_size blind so have had to order another one ... hope the fabric doesn_'_t alter too much between batches !
neutral	first , they should offer a spoiled_rotten dog / cat combo because a lot of people have both and cannot_afford both .
neutral	next , i did try the cat spoiled_rotten program but cancelled after only one delivery because it had too many food items .
neutral	spoiling to me means fun -- toys , surprises and maybe one food treat .
neutral	and it had a brush .... really , a brush (?).
neutral	also , i did not feel it was worth the $_00 as_advertised but i was not familiar with those food items and my cats can '_t eat a lot of different foods ( like most ) or they will get upset tummies .
neutral	i thought it was going to be toys ,
neutral	the fridge itself seems fine .
neutral	it is almost the same as one we bought 00 months_ago .
neutral	sadly that went wrong .
neutral	hence us ordering a replacement one .
neutral	my husband met the two delivery_men .
neutral	it was last thing on a sunday_afternoon .
neutral	they chuntered about our very steep downhill drive .
neutral	my husband actually went to meet and greet and assist them .
neutral	on a scale of 0 to 0 he compaired the delivery wxperience with the last one and only gave them a poor 0 because of their rather negative attitude .
neutral	the website was great for compare units and finding the best one for me .
neutral	only issue was that i made a reservation through the site and when i got to the storage_facility they had no record of it .
neutral	luckily they had a unit available for me .
neutral	really ?
neutral	" i '_m just saying what the owner '_s manual states ".
neutral	" i '_m not trying to sell you anything :.
neutral	" i '_m just saying ".
neutral	is that how you speak to people .
neutral	lovely sales tactic .
neutral	not yet received item so cannot do review . with the bank_holidays i am still_waiting for my items .
neutral	i got my book for a great price and the experience of buying it from bookbyte was great but the book was in worse condition than_expected .
neutral	quick delivery of the cook cart and looks like its made from good materials but lots of washer / bolts for the fixing screws / bolts were missing and after a phone_call next_day i am still_waiting for these to arrive - have spent a week tripping over the parts that fill the kitchen_floor .
neutral	would have expected next_day airmail missing bits so disappointed and worried they won_'_t get sent
neutral	love the fact that delivery . com covers many categories and has an incentive program , unlike_other similar services .
neutral	however , the website needs a full redesign .
neutral	its awful , looks like its from 0000 .
neutral	also , the offers that are emailed to me don_'_t automatically show up in my app and there is no way to apply them to the app since i must click through the email to activate , so it makes using the app inconvenient when i have an offer .
neutral	also , whenever i check " do not provide plastic utensils " the restaurant always brings them , regardless of the place .
neutral	that being said , these establishments need to be communicated to by delivery . com to explain the importance of this .
neutral	its wasteful .
neutral	hotel is convenient to beach , of course lobby is always nice .
neutral	in the hallway on the 0th fl carpet has stains on floor , if you can get pass the dirty walls and doors on the outside of the room .
neutral	inside the rooms was pretty clean but a lil dusty with dust flying off the ceiling fan .
neutral	prescription from vet was on file and i received an_email that my order was received and would be shipped .
neutral	after 0 days , i checked order status and it showed as pending .
neutral	when i called support , they said they needed script from my vet ( even_though written script was on file ).
neutral	my vet phoned immediately to complete order .
neutral	it still took 0 days from this phone_call for order to ship .
neutral	this delay is not acceptable .
neutral	will not order from here again b
neutral	the agents were helpful on the phone and in person at the particular location i '_m renting at but i don_'_t like being refused the bathroom code and having to ask for someone to come and open it for me , what happens when i come after the office has closed ?
neutral	also , there is very little to no lighting at night .
neutral	there are light_bulbs in the unit but they don_'_t work .
neutral	why is that ?
neutral	first time i use this website , the rate for the hotel choosen was the best one , but when booking i had some internet problems and the date choosen changed ... meaning i confirmed a wrong date , and paid of course ... an non_- refundable booking .
neutral	thanks god the lenght also changed into one night ...
neutral	i only lost one night and had to redo it all again , with the correct dates this time .
neutral	it is my fault i know , but usually with other web_site , there is a reminder of what you book before you pay , to make_sure you dont make mistakes ...
neutral	the magnet '_s were fine , but i do have a huge problem .
neutral	when i picked_up the parcel , i put the package in my bag and drove 0 minutes to my house .
neutral	phone dead !
neutral	when i opened the package it had a big hazard triangles on it and said about how strong the magnets were , and not to put the magnets near i - pods , i presumed this meant i - phones too .
neutral	so i checked that my i phone was in working order , cos i had just received a picture , i wanted to save the received picture to my phone and nothing , no power , no broken picture or even flicker , nothing !
neutral	the plastic on the outside of the unopened package was plain and gave no_indication as to how dangerous and powerful the magnets are , the outside packaging needs to have a warning information on it prominently printed , or when the order is placed , there needs to be a separate information e_- mail_stating how dangerous these magnets are .
neutral	the pre_- sales service was great , because i had a lot of questions .
neutral	but now i have no phone !
neutral	kind_regards ,
neutral	sarah mcgahon
neutral	i ordered a shirt , and the first one that arrived was not only the wrong dog on the front , but also the wrong_size .
neutral	upon contacting pet - flow , they immediately took_care of the issue .
neutral	when i got the shirt i ordered , it was correct .. but i had ordered a medium .. and the medium was so big !
neutral	i wish they would have women '_s sizes apart_from the mens .
neutral	oh well .. i guess i can always use the shirt for bed .
neutral	i just booked a trip on bookit and overall was satified with the website and the price we paid for our trip .
neutral	the only_complaint i had was that the site identified the hotel we selected as " center strip " and it is one of the last hotels on the vegas strip .
neutral	this is a significant problem because one of my travel companions has a disability that makes walking difficult .
neutral	we would have selected another resort had ours not been misidentified as being on the center of the vegas strip on the website .
neutral	staff not very helpful .
neutral	i had to ask a lot of questions to get a few answers , but maybe that was just that one individual .
neutral	the car and contract were as_advertised .
neutral	i '_ll use economy again ( i '_ve used them in the past and had better customer_service ).
neutral	i can check for the prices and the most convenient times and places .
neutral	my only problem on my trip to new_orleans was that i booked a hotel ( midtown - new_orleans ) with the help of travelocity - and it was the worst hotel experience i have ever had .
neutral	the room had no amenities whatsoever - not even a trash can , telephone , or smoke detector .
neutral	you might want to consider not listing places where people are afraid they might be found stuffed in a dumpster the next_day .
neutral	other_travelers agreed with this the morning of checkout .
neutral	let the buyer_beware !!!!!
neutral	!
neutral	i love shopping here because the deal is so good , but the shipping cost is high ; in the end , the deal is just ok .
neutral	even_though you lives close by , you cannot do local pick_up to save on the shipping cost .
neutral	you should check you final out - of - pocket cost , as the discount may not be proper applied .
neutral	the customer_service does not issue refund immediately as it takes_forever for them to do this .
neutral	plants havent arrived .
neutral	suggest your survey is prematurely timed .
neutral	i get delivery once a day .
neutral	though i '_m thankful for the point - system , $ 0 discounts , and the other promotions , the app is often hit / miss experience .
neutral	i often receive an " error " message .
neutral	i can '_t save my favorites , because of this error_message .
neutral	great site for car parts !
neutral	items arrived super quick .
neutral	however .
neutral	there online customer_service needs work ... i emailed them about a problem with the tracking_info they sent me and never once did any one get back to me
neutral	i ordered 0 onesies for the christmas_season .
neutral	the quality is not great - i '_m going to have to do some sewing on the one as a seam down the leg has come undone .
neutral	also i didn_'_t get the sizing prefect - would have been mor comfortable with a larger_size .
neutral	the service was good - postage from the uk always takes a couple of days , but that was fine .
neutral	delivery was fine but using your website is always difficult for me .
neutral	the at cost part always goes back to the beginning whenever i order something and then go back to shopping .
neutral	this wastes a lot of time .
neutral	i always have trouble checking out .
neutral	i don_'_t have the same problems with other_sites , so i '_m puzzled as to what the issues are .
neutral	thank_goodness for the chat you '_ve set_up .
neutral	that makes it possible to order with sanity .
neutral	if not for the chat , i probably would have given up on your site a long time ago .
neutral	i hope you can improve the website so as to make it easier for customers to navigate and purchase things quickly .
neutral	the decaf capsules i ordered did not work properly .
neutral	one day after i ordered my alternator on parts_geek i found out that i actually didn_'_t need that part and that it was my tensioner pulley that was going bad .
neutral	unfortunately { as stated all over the website } i could not cancel my order .
neutral	the delivery also took over a week , so if it was my alternator then i would have been without a car for a week so i would have had to pay to rent a car which would more than pay for just paying retail at autozone .
neutral	my advice , if you really need the part and your car isn_'_t working without it i would go elsewhere .
neutral	but i did get my part , and it was what i ordered .
neutral	unfortunately if i return it then i will have to pay a penalty , so i will probably just keep it and kick myself everytime that i walk past it in the garage .
neutral	honestly , i probably_won_'_t order a part online again .
neutral	bought an la electric twelve string diy kit , very easy to put_together , the difficult bits were 0 .
neutral	painting and finishing the body which is made from soft wood and shows every dink and sanding scratch , bare in mind good paint will cost nearly as much as the kit .
neutral	0 .
neutral	setting_up the guitar , to get intonation correct , a reasonable action , and keeping it in tune , all this is going to take some time as the wood is " moving under stress " none of this is the fault of gear0music , i am fairly pleased with my purchase , after all , the product i end up with on a diy kit is really up to me .
neutral	in an effort to save_money i ordered this coffee and although it is good - it is unlike the real nespresso .
neutral	it is not as satisfying and aromatic .
neutral	with normal expresso , i never add milk or sugar because the taste is delicious .
neutral	the taste is lacking .
neutral	sorry .
neutral	i am glad i tried it , but will not be ordering again .
neutral	while i was thrilled that one of the trees had several baby lemons already , one did not .
neutral	another problem i had was that during packing , one of the trees had a large branch broken off .
neutral	the packaging itself and the speedy_delivery were excellent .
neutral	just disappointed about the broken limb ...
neutral	i was very sorry that yor colours were not as shown on the computer , my computer is not at fault re colours .
neutral	i was quoted 00 dollars and when the check got here it was only 00 .
neutral	i know that there is a time limit but it is not my fault that the mail was slow and there was a sunday during the time .
neutral	i sent it out as early as i could .
neutral	this was the first time that i had a bad_experience .
neutral	the site was easy to navigate and easy to adapt the card , which i really liked .
neutral	and i thought it was a good price for someone_who doesn_'_t need a lot of cards .
neutral	however , i chose the " textured " material , because i thought it would be a nicer material than the matte .
neutral	i wish there had been a warning or a photo of what it actually looked like and that it wasn_'_t advisable for someone putting a photo of themselves on the card -- it made my photo look very strange and i '_m slightly embarrassed to hand it out now .
neutral	i would just please advise them to put a warning notice to people choosing the textured option to consider only selecting matte .
neutral	i ordered a case of dog_food on the phone and after a little over a week , i still did not have it .
neutral	i called and found out that the guy_who took the order did not ask about my vet , and this was required because of the prescription of the dog_food .
neutral	he never called back to get that information .
neutral	i did not think to provide it because this was my second order for the same food , so i thought the information was stored in my file .
neutral	had i not called , the order would have remained unfilled .
neutral	sloppy .
neutral	ordering online was great and easy .
neutral	however i never got a password to look up my ups status and on top of that i requested to have my package delivered with a signature required .
neutral	however on nov . 00th at 0 :_00pm the package was delivered and the ups driver_rang the door_bell and took off .
neutral	i was less_than 00ft away from the door and when i got to the door after hearing the door_bell ring i got to watch the ups drive away and the package was left_outside on the ground when i have a screened in front_porch .
neutral	so overall i say for the price of the item and the easiness of buying my item was great but for service and the way my request was ignored i ' d have to say it was very lousy .
neutral	sometimes the clothes were surprisingly good quality for the money ,
neutral	and sometimes what i received looked nice only on the picture
neutral	as the fabric & colours of the received item looked quite cheap .
neutral	still the service is good if you want to send things back .
neutral	i think they used to have a policy that you cannot return an item ,
neutral	you can only exchange it for a different size ,
neutral	but it '_s no_longer the case , therefore 0_stars .
neutral	hi thanks for a quick delivery i don_'_t no why i paid_extra for a 0 - 0 day delivery when the items arrived in 0 days i order these items for my property in france so had them delivered to my mother - in - laws expecting that i would be there for their arrival but no they came far to quickly
neutral	petflow '_s prices compare well to those of other pet_supply sites ( i '_ve visited / used quite a few ), and their shipping rates are lower .
neutral	that '_s the good news .
neutral	the bad_news : they use deceptive advertising practices to gain your business .
neutral	ex : every special promotional ad that states " free_shipping !"
neutral	is in fact referring to their standard shipping policy , while they write it to sound like that particular promotion includes free_shipping on all orders .
neutral	it doesn_'_t become apparent until either calling to clarify , or at check - out .
neutral	beware this flawed tactic ... otherwise they get a woof .
neutral	not happy !
neutral	00 days have passed .
neutral	my account was charged within one hour of web purchase .
neutral	no updates from partsgeek . com at all .
neutral	when i go to track on their web_site it still says ' processing '.
neutral	purchases should not be charged until item is shipped !!!!!!!
neutral	!
neutral	updates about shipping delays should be conveyed thru email to customers !
neutral	order is on back order .
neutral	ask me again when i receive the order as to how long it takes for me to receive the order .
neutral	then i will give my true opinion .
neutral	the service was quick and the products i received were better_than i expected quality wise but to charge me to restock the items is a cheek esp when its an online store and we can return to a physical location ourselves .
neutral	i appreciate returns postage is paid for but majority of retailers do free returns and i don_'_t think i have come_across a stocking charge .
neutral	i don_'_t think i will be using boohoo unless there is something i desperately want .
neutral	i received confirmation of my booking fee this morning with the added note that the remainder of the fare is also due today , but that you will remind_me in a week or so , what '_s happening ???
neutral	?
neutral	i booked online and when i received a confirmation the first page stated the date that it made the reservation as check i .
neutral	and out on .
neutral	the .
neutral	same date , which was confusing , i had to verify that i only booked 0 date later on in the year and hopefully not charged for 0 dates .
neutral	my first order was great .
neutral	no_problems what so ever , timely delivery .
neutral	my 0nd order not so much .
neutral	i responded to a sale email i was sent for items .
neutral	i ordered 00 items and when i received them , only 0 items met my expectations .
neutral	the shipping was poor in the extreme .
neutral	i paid for expedited_shipping and didn_'_t get it when i needed it .
neutral	also , there was a lot of wasted shipping .
neutral	instead of waiting until another order was complete it came in three or four boxes .
neutral	as an example a little tube of cream came in it '_s own small box .
neutral	was it overlooked in the larger order or was it out of stock when the original order was filled ?
neutral	makes one wonder_why ?
neutral	extra packaging and postage .
neutral	hi !
neutral	i love my perfumes from parfum0 .
neutral	i can find all the great brands there that are not available at some of the other online stores . however my last purchase of approx $_000_dollars was met with a ups charge of another $_00 !
neutral	this was not duties or customs but ridiculous ups surcharges .
neutral	unfortunately i have to purchase elsewhere from now on .
neutral	i felt the facility was standard and adequate .
neutral	but i didn_'_t like the low level of security .
neutral	in late january on a monday i went to the facility . the main gate wasn_'_t working and was completely open for anyone to drive in .
neutral	no repair personnel or vehicles any where in sight .
neutral	i thought maybe they were waiting for them to arrive .
neutral	i returned 0 days_later on wednesday , and the gate was still broken and completely open .
neutral	again , no repair personnel in sight .
neutral	also , i don_'_t think it '_s very secure that all the exterior doors leading into the building open with the same code , a very simple to figure_out 0 - 0 - 0 .
neutral	and the door that i used to access the building never closed completely by itself .
neutral	your internet services were good .
neutral	i made a mistake on the date and had to cancel the first reservation and book it again .
neutral	when we arrived at the hotel they only had the first reservation with the wrong date .
neutral	not sure what happened , but the hotel took good care of us .
neutral	i was right in the middle of my flight booking when the price of my airline_ticket jumped up significantly .
neutral	there was also no seat map available to see if i would be denied a ticket because of the location of the seat i was trying to select .
neutral	this occurred twice while trying to book my flight .
neutral	i was eventually able to book a flight by not trying to select a window seat .
neutral	during this process i ended_up spending more than $_00 over the price that was advertised on your sight .
neutral	i have used your sight before to book flights and would like to continue if these issues can be addressed .
neutral	fedex and petflows site did not reflect the same message and delivery was off by 0 days .
neutral	chemist_direct is a great company selling well_known_brands at fantastic prices .
neutral	delivery was very good .
neutral	my only moan is that it states buy one get one free on their malibu suncare but if you buy multiple bottles it changes to buy one get cheapest free !
neutral	still a good offer but not what they advertise on the web_page !
neutral	had to call , the person on the other end not so nice .
neutral	terrible area .
neutral	the hotel decor is nice and so was the staff .
neutral	it just seemed an unsafe part pf town .
neutral	usually excellent product received in a timely_manner .
neutral	this last order my product was damaged and it didn_'_t seem as though anyone was too concerned_about it .
neutral	there was a discontinued product and i wasn_'_t informed prior to my shipment .
neutral	it seems a little unprofessional to send items and not tell me something is out of stock .
neutral	how about a call and a substitution ?
neutral	instead of shipping me stuff , and me contacting you about something that didn_'_t come ? the ease to order was there , product delivery time was good , just sevice was lacking .
neutral	i was told one price on line and when i called they said with the unit they gave_me needed a special lock that had to be purchased from them which raised the price by $_00 . 00 dollars .
neutral	i feel i was tricked .
neutral	very bad you dont have phone_number , when i order duplicate after 0 min .
neutral	try to cancel but you dont have number i was to sad . i just loose money ( so_far for shipping ) and my time . thanks
neutral	the company '_s phone_number has_been disconnected .
neutral	what '_s up with that ?
neutral	my situation has_been resolved .
neutral	i received a pair of defective boots and they have credited my account .
neutral	you need to put the proper phone_number on your invoices .
neutral	it makes one suspicious when you hear a companys phone has_been disconnected .
neutral	this site quote prices without tax added so that it looks cheaper_than others .
neutral	you don_'_t get the final price until the last page on the booking form which makes it difficult to compare with other_sites .
neutral	i booked my hotel with this site as it looked like it was much_cheaper but by the time i completed the booking with taxes added it was more_expensive than the same hotel on other_sites such as booking . com
neutral	on a positive_note it was simple to use and the booking process was very quick .
neutral	i '_ve just finished my first bottle of " green_coffee_beans " and have not lost any weight but now have extremely loose bowels that i can only attribute to this new product .
neutral	it has_become a concern so i stopped using them today to confirm my theory .
neutral	i will see what happens and review again .
neutral	i am frugal so i like the savings but the coffee is much_better when i purchase it from nespresso .
neutral	a lot of items out of stock .
neutral	also says free_shipping but if you don_'_t pay it takes over 0_weeks !
neutral	customer_service was great no question there .
neutral	however , the shirts and hoodies were less_than what i expected in terms of quality .
neutral	i needed thick hoodies that could provide more warmth than an average spring type hoodie and these were definitely not it .
neutral	they ' re thin and the guys don_'_t wear them .
neutral	as for the shirts , same situation on quality , my husband has already torn the pocket on one of the shirts .
neutral	the print graphics are the only_thing that has lasted .
neutral	my overall rating is purely based on the quality and durability .
neutral	it is unlikely i will be ordering in the future from rush order_tees for our company '_s needs as i feel as though $_000_+ was wasted on products that have proven to be inadequate for our needs .
neutral	good luck with other current and future clients .
neutral	i love the prices , but shipping is terribly slow .
neutral	service was speedy .
neutral	however , the entire_transaction would have been much smoother if the merchandise were described in detail such as with what systems the software could be used .
neutral	the booking went_smoothly and the reservation was fine .
neutral	the hotel is lovely .
neutral	staff is a little dicey .
neutral	we found the breakfast_buffet a bit_confusing , and apparently asked the wrong person for eggs .
neutral	the waitress got a bit hostile .
neutral	then , on checkout , we waited and waited for our_luggage to be brought to the front .
neutral	i returned to reception and asked , again , for the bags .
neutral	finally , after 00_minutes , my husband went to the front_desk and asked for the key back so he could get the luggage himself .
neutral	the manager handed him the key , thought better of it , and immediately rang for someone to get the bags .
neutral	they finally came five or ten_minutes later .
neutral	i was sent the wrong order .
neutral	after i emailed and made 0 calls ( got a recording
neutral	each time ) i was then contacted by email with an_apology and email_saying
neutral	to mail back the glasses i had ordered and my correct order would be sent me .
neutral	also they said my return postage would be refunded me , this was obviously a
neutral	mistake and mix up ; none the less an inconvenience and delay .
neutral	i am waiting
neutral	to receive my order and am in hopes it will be correct this time .
neutral	i thought she was very nice on the phone however it was hard to understand her at times .
neutral	and i thought the flight schedule seemed a bit extreme .
neutral	other than that , i hope we have a wonderful time !
neutral	thanks
neutral	experience would have been excellent if a status was emailed .
neutral	when it was shipped and estimated time of arrival .
neutral	i still have not received gift_card and it has_been approx 0 days .
neutral	00_% restocking_fee - so beware of returns .
neutral	return fees are on you as well .
neutral	merchandise is original but shipping can take up to 0_weeks .
neutral	i was not happy with the fact that i placed an order , you said it was packed and was in shipping .
neutral	then i get an_email_saying you had refunded my money for part of my order that was out of stock .
neutral	you should know what you have in stock and not allow any to be purchased when you don_'_t have any .
neutral	i would have preferred to wait for the out of stock items than to have had the refund , but no , you didn_'_t give me a choice .
neutral	being in retail , you always do all you can to please your customer .
neutral	you blew it big time .
neutral	i '_m not sure i ' d order from you again .
neutral	i used autoeurope when traveling to ireland three years_ago and had a great experience .
neutral	i used them again recently for a trip to italy .
neutral	reserving the car online was simple and their website was easy to use .
neutral	my car was ready when i went to pick it up at the pisa airport .
neutral	however , the avis agent was rude and unhelpful .
neutral	there was a language_barrier .
neutral	i had to return to the counter to be sure i had all of the insurance i needed on the car and she made a very rude comment regarding my level of intelligence .
neutral	i have never been spoken to - especially by a customer_service person - in this manner .
neutral	i will probably use autoeurope again , but was disappointed by this treatment .
neutral	different feel from my original oralb toothbrush head but alright .
neutral	my husband is less sure , thinking that he does not get such a good clean
neutral	need to enter this century and add e gift_cards , i know you lost one sale by not offering this .
neutral	another sale was lost because you can '_t order anything on saturdays because you ' re closed .
neutral	not sure why you don_'_t allow online orders during closed hours ?
neutral	the service was very good and i received my harlequin bedding very quickly however i am_currently in the process of returning as the the product did not live up to the colour shown on the photograph .
neutral	i am aware that buying online may mean the colours vary but the same image was used to show the bedding on the actually product packaging which is very misleading .
neutral	instead of white , purple and green bedding it is a dark cream ( almost gold ), light purple and a mustard colour .
neutral	i was very disappointed as i have searched for my dream bedding for my soon to be husband and i to have for our first home and had thought i ' d found it .
neutral	the search goes on .
neutral	maybe i was just tired but ... when we went to check in , our room was not right .
neutral	we had requested a king_room at the time of reservation but was given a standard double .
neutral	we asked for a late check out since it was after midnight already and was told no by the front_desk .
neutral	when we made the reservation , we asked for a room close to the elevator and on a low to mid level floor ... we were on the next to top floor and as far away from the elevator ( and vending and ice ) as we could be .
neutral	like i said maybe i was just tired but ....
neutral	dumb asses sent me the wrong color swimsuit .
neutral	you should have given me something free for your damn screw up !
neutral	bought a brilliant product just disappointed that they couldn_'_t price match the item meant i ended out paying more than i could have .
neutral	was delivered quickly and all goods in good condition .
neutral	as yet we haven_'_t installed the bathroom so yet to know if there are any faults .
neutral	the prices were what attracted us to the site but the delivery was expensive especially given the amount we had just paid .
neutral	needing to check on delivery was a real_pain and the 00_minutes wasn_'_t really enough so we didn_'_t get to open all boxes properly .
neutral	i just hope we don_'_t find a problem as you have to sign before the delivery driver leaves ( he also although not rude stood over us while we checked it over which made the process feel even more rushed )
neutral	quality doesn_'_t seem to bad what we have seen of it so we will just have to wait and see if it stands up to the websites claims .
neutral	...............
neutral	my phone_number was not ok for the first time verification .
neutral	i finally get a code by text but i have the same problem now when i try to buy a second item .
neutral	i hope i will not have this problem each time i try to purshase something .
neutral	bookit i am sure is a great company .
neutral	i had one problem .
neutral	i was not satisfied with my room .
neutral	the next time i am going to have to ask more questions about the room location .
neutral	we were at the top of the mountain .
neutral	very few people around .
neutral	far from the pool , workout room , and the other amenities the resort had to offer .
neutral	wasted weekend
neutral	their best part , i checked is daily_deals on unlocked cellphones and free_shipping on all deals .
neutral	as i guess , you need to enter some promo_code , which is mentioned on product page .
neutral	from start to finish i had a headache when i placed my very first order with petflow ...
neutral	but must give credit where credit is due ... customer_service was extremely understanding and helpful to make it right .
neutral	i was happy with your website when i purchased online .
neutral	i just wish there was more inventory in stock .
neutral	when there was a certain item i looked for that gave_me more for my money it was out of stock so i wasnt able to get everything i wanted but i did get a starter so that was ok .
neutral	service was good but when the email was received saying the cheque was in the post it took nearly 0_weeks for it to arrive , by that time i had cancelled the first cheque and another had been issued which arrived within a week .
neutral	the books , although withing their stated time of arrival , took a long time to get to my house , much longer_than amazon normally does .
neutral	one of the boks didn_'_t get to my house for 0_weeks .
neutral	i probably_won_'_t be usung bookbyte again if i was in a hurry .
neutral	your selection of products seems very limited to me .
neutral	i would like to see a bigger variety .
neutral	good range of clothes , but are quite expensive and sometimes the measurements are wrong .
neutral	i '_m sorry to say this , as san_francisco herbs has_been supplying me and my family with excellent herbs for decades .
neutral	but this time i ordered some fragrance oils , chasing that ever elusive source of some simple floral scent oils .
neutral	what i got was classic dryer sheet cheap scent that stays on your skin even after you wash it ten times .
neutral	i hate dryer sheet scent , and now need to throw these brand_new fragrance oils in the trash to get_rid of that offensive lingering odor .
neutral	thanks for nothing .
neutral	i won_'_t buy your herbs anymore because this fake smell just ticks me off !
neutral	there is no_doubt appliances on line are competitively_priced , however don_'_t be misled with promises of vouchers .
neutral	i bought a fridge_freezer which was supposed to come with which vouchers for iceland .
neutral	the appliance has_been with me 0 months , no vouchers , have e_mailed and had no reply .
neutral	hi , envelopes we just as i expected , so web_site is good at description .
neutral	sadly the packaging was not quite so good and the sides of the large christmas envelopes are slightly_bent .
neutral	ok as these are for my teenage grandsons and they are more interested in the money inside .
neutral	but it would have been a shame if the use had been more important .
neutral	i think the packaging had ' sliped ' somehow - worth thinking about for the future .
neutral	i used the calendar to book my hotel stay .
neutral	somehow i ended_up booked in the wrong month .
neutral	not sure when or how it happened , but my reservation ended_up being in march when it should have been in february .
neutral	the person i had to deal with to fix the situation from the hotel when i went to check in spoke broken english and the phone connection was terrible .
neutral	it took the woman at the hotel and me an_hour to fix the situation and the woman on the phone was not very helpful .
neutral	i ended_up getting charged $_00 for some fee , i still_haven_'_t been able to find out what that was for . the hotel itself was great .
neutral	clean and the staff was excellent .
neutral	i would recommend the hotel to anyone .
neutral	i have no_idea when the rest of my order will get to me .
neutral	i wish i would have been given some_sort of idea what to expect .
neutral	i asked the recipients to send me a photo of their gift that they were very happy with .
neutral	however compared to the photo on your website ( i realise it cannot be an exact replica ) and the flowers sent i really thought it was very small for the money paid .
neutral	if that was a large_selection i dread to think what a small one would have looked like .
neutral	please package the dog_treats in bubble_wrap or crushed paper so that the canned_dog_food doesn_'_t crush the dog_treats .
neutral	i spend extra money to buy natural treats with no preservatives or other harmful ingredients and you put them in the box next to the canned_dog_food .
neutral	whenever the shipper picks_up the box and throws it down , the dog_treats get crushed .
neutral	three bags of dog_treats recently arrived and there is not one whole dog treat in any of the bags !!
neutral	this defeats the whole purpose for using petflow , as i have to go out to the store to repurchase the items .
neutral	otherwise i think your service is awesome , but please think about the packaging of items prior to shipment .
neutral	thank_you .
neutral	i would love
neutral	to review your service but the parts i ordered came damaged and had to be refused .
neutral	when i spoke to the shipping claims agent they tell me it could take 00 to 000 days to settle my claim .
neutral	not very good news since my vehicle is sitting in the garage , undriveable , waiting for the parts i trustingly ordered from your company .
neutral	they close to days got wait_till tuesday to get inform about location and rates .... not good
neutral	clothes came in about a week , very nice but two sizes too small !
neutral	the sizes run small so u have to order your clothes 0 sizes bigger
neutral	i don_'_t like it when they make u write something more then a few words
neutral	i had what started out as a really bad_experience with this company recently .
neutral	i had ordered 0 new phones and was going to switch providers and keep my old cell_phone numbers ( this is called " porting ").
neutral	my phone_number was ported before i actually received my new phones though , leaving me without service for several days .
neutral	i knew i was going to be out of town and i wasn_'_t concerned with getting my phones quickly and had planned to activate them when i got back in town so i didn_'_t choose a fast shipping option .
neutral	but your old service gets cut_off when they port your number and even_though my new provider had me all set_up , i had not received my new phones yet .
neutral	therefore i could not use my old phone and had no phone service .
neutral	i called customer_service to try and resolve this situation and had a bad_experience with that as well .
neutral	the guy kept telling_me that i chose the wrong shipping option when the problem was really that my number was ported before i received the phone and activated it .
neutral	i '_m not sure if this was a fluke or what .
neutral	however , i was contacted within 00_hours of placing a complaint by a manager and the coo and they apologized and next_day aired me my phones and 0 free accessories .
neutral	i still had to go without a phone for 0 days but they really stepped up to correct the situation !
neutral	and i felt_like they were really concerned_about resolving everything so that i was happy .
neutral	so , at the end of the day , even_though i didn_'_t have the best experience in the beginning , they did work hard to resolve it and make it right .
neutral	i placed a order for three shoes but one was not in stock i didnt know until i got an_email .
neutral	i was kinda upset because the size was listed as available so i was not happy at all .
neutral	i shop online all the time it should not show available if it is not .
neutral	then the representative said she wasnt_sure if you all would get them in then said " probably not ".
neutral	the parts came in somewhat of a timely_manner , but one part was broken and needs to be replaced .
neutral	there is no phone_number to be able to talk to anyone and that is very frustrating !!!
neutral	everything is done via_email , but when you need answers there needs to be a phone_number to speak with someone .
neutral	the phone_number on the invoice is a shipping distribution_center that tells you to contact the company .
neutral	the prices are great , but we didn_'_t expect all this when we are trying to get it replaced .
neutral	disappointed to say the least .
neutral	bought an office telephone ( a bt converse ) and was unable to use it as it had the british phone connection at the end of the wire .
neutral	would it not be a good idea to sell irish adaptor with british phone ?
neutral	i decided to shop with bestbuy . com for cyber_monday because they had a few really good deals .
neutral	i opted to do in store pickup because i thought it would be easy .
neutral	the ordering itself was simple .
neutral	however , i did not get a confirmation_email or even a pick_up email .
neutral	i called the store later in the day to find out about the order and i was put on hold for 00_minutes .
neutral	when i got to the store it was nothing but issues and annoyances .
neutral	in the end i got the items at a really great deal ( half the price of amazon which is saying something ) so i guess it wasn_'_t a total loss .
neutral	however , i have done site to store with several other stores and never had this many issues .
neutral	hi , if someone ask me to say something good about this website , i '_m going to say that i really love the way they deliver things .
neutral	they have been honest , like if they say they going to make it in five days and that will happen .
neutral	i really appreciate that .
neutral	they don_'_t really have as many thing as i want to buy but at_least i enjoy_shopping here .
neutral	i have been shopping here once but i feel_comfortable to shop_here .
neutral	they get a cheap shipping , that is soo great ,,,.
neutral	anyway , they are the best !!
neutral	<_0
neutral	i enjoy ordering from you guys , in the past my order would get here in three_days .
neutral	these last two times the order has taken about 0 days and still_waiting on an order that i placed 0 days ago .
neutral	shipping rates are high , coupons would be good to lighten the fees
neutral	it was very easy to book but you have to really pay_attention to dates .
neutral	i was trying to book a 0 day stay on a particular weekend and didn_'_t realize that a different date had come up and for one night only .
neutral	when i verified with the hotel about the size of bed , they told me about the mistake and booked the correct dates .
neutral	my products were okay .
neutral	i didn_'_t like the fact that my shoes didn_'_t come in a box .
neutral	my black jeans were not jeans they were legging material .
neutral	my legging has thread hanging from the zipper .
neutral	love the idea of using your site to get the best price and it '_s easy to use so will_definitely come again but we were not impressed with the end supplier who delivered the oil .
neutral	we would like the option to opt_out of certain supplier deliveries .
neutral	i '_ve purchased from figleaves off and on for many years .
neutral	i am an unusual size and have been very happy with the selection of lingerie and swim_suits .
neutral	unfortunately , you cannot tell what the customs_fees will be upfront , and i received a bill for $_00 ( us ) just for the customs_fees - 00_% more to the cost of my order .
neutral	then , i received a foreign use charge from my credit_card company on top of that !
neutral	the first order arrived just fine .
neutral	the second order was placed on 00 dec 0000 and arrived on 00 jan_0000 !!
neutral	i contacted figleaves by email several_times and they kept putting me off , suggesting i hadn_'_t been home to receive the package ( i work from home ) and then just asking me to wait and wait more .
neutral	i did have to return a few items from the first shipment ( insured ).
neutral	it '_s been a week and a half and i have not received a refund yet .
neutral	the stethoscope arrived and the box was opened only to view the product .
neutral	the product was not touched or taken out of the box until it was opened as a xmas gift .
neutral	it was found that one of the pieces was defective .
neutral	your customer_service person told her to basically try to fix it herself or bring it to a medical_supply_store to fix .
neutral	the fact remains that the product was not in new condition and should have been replaced .
neutral	the big_bus_tour was very enjoyable but was diminished due to the radio thing you put your earphones into not working .
neutral	there were 0 of us travelling together and the very best we could do was 0 of us being_able to hear the tour_guide at any one time .
neutral	i ordered a branded eyeglasses .
neutral	i read the product desciption clearly that it comes with an original case ( and i do value an original blue case ), but it did not .
neutral	the on - line customer_service was prompt , and she told me that all clearance items may be due to open box sale , customer returns , " missing cases " and closeouts .
neutral	in that case , they should put " missing case " instead of " this item comes with an original case , cloth and certificate of authenticity where appropriate ."
neutral	she said i can return it but i have to pay 00_% restocking_fee and shipping cost .
neutral	i regret buying it but i have concern on the returning cost .
neutral	my advise to you : do ask more before you order
neutral	competitive price and fast delivery though .
neutral	i am disappointed that i can not supply my aarp , aaa or senior status for discounts when booking .
neutral	i really liked travelocity until i bought my parents a gift_card .
neutral	it is super restrictive !
neutral	you can '_t even book a flight with it and to redeem it you have to go to a website that is really not user_friendly .
neutral	and the hotels offered there are also restricted .
neutral	i paid cash for it and i just feel_like i should be able to use it like cash and it '_s not like that at all !
neutral	to the point where i just bought it back from my parents .
neutral	the worst !!
neutral	!
neutral	until then i really liked using travelocity .
neutral	their normal website is very user_friendly and offers many options for hotel , flight and rentals .
neutral	airline was late ( us air ) going in and coming out .
neutral	but the hotel and staff were great .
neutral	a true taste of nyc .
neutral	have been pleased with some of my orders but not others , i cannot_fault the service you offer especially with free returns , i would recommend your company to friends
neutral	i received my pkg quite fast .
neutral	i was disappointed to find one of the dog collar_lights ( clip on ) didn_'_t work .
neutral	i was glad i ordered light collars and clip on lights .
neutral	the order arrived , was packed well , and was well priced .
neutral	however , when i purchased it was indicated that the items would be shipped the week of july 0 .
neutral	imagine how pleased i was to receive shipping notification that my package was shipped on july 0 , and would be arriving to me on july 00 .
neutral	now , i have trouble getting my packages from my apartment office , so i left work early on the 00th to meet the ups driver .
neutral	except , no delivery driver on the 00th .
neutral	i checked the tracking again , and this time it showed that no , the items didn_'_t ship until the 00th , and would be arriving on the 00th .
neutral	well , i couldn_'_t take another day off of work , so my cats ' food sat in the apartment office for two_days before i could get there while they were open .
neutral	i wouldn_'_t have minded the items being shipped on the 00th , i just don_'_t like to be told one thong , and then have another happen .
neutral	i had purchased seat selection and when i had received my tickets the seats i had bought were not marked on my tickets .
neutral	well_packaged to avoid_damage with everything included as specified .
neutral	just disappointing that despite extra carriage charge for next_day delivery , the product didn_'_t arrive on time .
neutral	nice cards but when i placed a large order they banged me with a huge shipping even_though every card was coming to my house .
neutral	when they spotted one picture that they deemed unacceptable they cancelled the whole order and not just the one .
neutral	frustrating .
neutral	customer_service told me if i did the shipping wrong i could cancel the whole order again and start again ...
neutral	offered me no aid nor compassion nor spirit .
neutral	i '_ve had a few past troubles with the colour being different then on screen or the product description is inaccurate but overall the products are at a goo price and the delivery is very quick
neutral	wish they had more translated visual novels .
neutral	along with all of the other american flight carriers , delta has gone to hell in a hand - basket in the past decade .
neutral	i purchased an international ticket on delta in april leaving in december .
neutral	they changed my flight details at_least four times between april and december .
neutral	now i was flying through a different city and arriving at a different time .
neutral	i said , " hey , if delta can change my ticket without cost , so can i ."
neutral	i called delta and had them change the details of my ticket - without the usual $_000 charge .
neutral	also , when i bought my ticket , they swore up and down there would be no international transaction fee .
neutral	guess what - i was hit with a $_00 international transaction / currency_exchange fee !
neutral	i called delta and received a $_00 credit_towards my next flight with them .
neutral	i order once a month and when it '_s not complete , it messes my whole month up !
neutral	i booked a room yesterday with olotels . com before doing my research .
neutral	after_reading so many negative_reviews about this company online , i am now concerned_about my reservation that was just made .
neutral	as of now , i have not received an e_- mail with my booking voucher and confirmation .
neutral	the site explains that i should receive this in 0hrs max .
neutral	but i have received nothing .. ( and believe me , i have checked my junk / spam ).
neutral	after reaching out to the olotels . com by e_- mail , i have still had no reply from a team representative regarding this matter .
neutral	fyi - the site makes it very difficult to find a contact number and print off anything from the booking .
neutral	i am quite disappointed with my experience so_far and suggest that they update their website immediately .
neutral	i have also tried to call the number i did find online , but it did not work .
neutral	since i work with companies in china / hk for a living , i know how to dial out the country code properly .
neutral	therefore , i do not believe that i made a mistake when making the initial call .
neutral	luckily my office has an office in guangzhou china .
neutral	if i do not get feedback by tomorrow , i will have one of our representatives call on behalf on me since they are located in hong_kong .
neutral	if someone from olotels team reads this , can you please e_- mail me at both e_- mail addresses so that i can provide my booking information for further review .
neutral	i would like my voucher to be sent and have a few questions_regarding your policy '_s .
neutral	natashalynn . sa @_gmail . com
neutral	hawaiian_ginger00 @_hotmail . com ( this e_- mail used for booking !)
neutral	thank_you ,

neutral	i ordered three items from boohoo , two of the same dress but different_sizes and a playsuit .
neutral	none of the items fitted correctly , something which ive found an_issue with boohoo before but am able to work around because i do like the styles they offer .
neutral	returned the items the day after recieving them .
neutral	has taken over 00 days for me to get my refund back , i emailed and was told it took up to 00 days to process , fine i suppose , but money is tight next christmas and when i have returned items before my money has_been refunded back pretty_much immediately .
neutral	anyway , i would use boohoo again , but i think that i waited so long before i got my money it was pretty annoying .
neutral	maybe i bought the wrong kind even_though it said zynga on it , itried it , the code didn_'_t work . probably_won_'_t do it again . sorry !
neutral	the cost of selling with all the fees ,, is just getting a bit overwhelming
neutral	i could not get into my account to view my itinerary .
neutral	i spent over an_hour on the phone with different representatives .
neutral	they would change my password and tell me i could log_into my account but it never worked .
neutral	at_least i was still able to take the trip and it was a deal which i am grateful for !
neutral	good service , as packages made in home in the same condition however missed the collection from pick_up company even_though i sat in all day and the buzzer never rang to the flat and reorganisation was difficult due to end of term university arrangements .
neutral	phone_number should be passed on to the delivery company in future to avoid such problems .
neutral	my order was supposed to be the grille and " assembly ".
neutral	was very happy that the grille itself was exactly_what i was hoping for but upset that the bolts were not included .
neutral	i guess i thought that was part of the assembly ...........
neutral	product was great .
neutral	but very slow shipping .
neutral	i absolutely love the clothes although some clothes are not true to size .
neutral	delivery is extremely bad - standard delivery is 0 days which in my opinion always results in 0 and you have to pay for that where as other_companies offer that free if charge and deliver faster .
neutral	this always makes me go to other_sites and not shop on here as much as i ' d like to .
neutral	i ordered two books on bookbyte ; one was rented and the other purchased .
neutral	i paid_extra shipping for both books , in order for it to come 0 - 0 days .
neutral	0 days passed and no books .
neutral	i e_- mailed them and , they replied a day later .
neutral	for the rented book , they told me that , at the time i ordered it , they were out - of - stock .
neutral	immediately , my thought was : " why wouldn_'_t they tell me that at the time of order ?
neutral	instead , i had to e_- mail them in order for them to have told me ."
neutral	this annoyed me , as i needed the book immediately .
neutral	nevertheless , they gave_me a full_refund for the rented book .
neutral	that was good .
neutral	however , the other book i purchased .
neutral	that was a bad order .
neutral	i e_- mailed them 0 days after i ordered it , and they answered the next_day .
neutral	they said i had paid for shipping of 0 - 0 days , when the receipt clearly said 0 - 0 days .
neutral	i got the book exactly 0 days after the time of order . however , i checked the tracking_number they had given me , and it turns_out that they had not shipped the book until i had e_- mailed them , one day before the book came .
neutral	this told me that they had made a huge mistake on my order and , in order to cover it , they lied .
neutral	so , i asked for a full_refund on the shipping cost .
neutral	they didn_'_t want it to give it to me , until i said i would fight for it .
neutral	finally , they said they would refund about half the amount i paid for shipping .
neutral	i agreed , and kept the book .
neutral	that was good and now i '_m satisfied .
neutral	overall , the experience was so - so .
neutral	it could have been better if they had been diligent in fulfilling the order exactly as it was and on - time .
neutral	service was very good but unfortunately the product had a tear !
neutral	will still use then again
neutral	hope this keeps my id safe
neutral	definitely suggest the postcard save the date option !
neutral	would have like to have more options to make the " personalized " card more personal as text was limited to just one font , size , and color .
neutral	any other text would have been an_additional_cost .
neutral	my school needed extra algebra 0 books .
neutral	i purchased as many as i could , for the lowest_prices i could find .
neutral	i bought 0 from bookbyte .
neutral	i was warned that they were not in great shape , but i didn_'_t expect them to be as bad as they were .
neutral	most needed to be rebound and were trashed .
neutral	i thought that there would be a large supply of algebra books that were that old , and that i would receive books comparable to the used ones we presently have at school .
neutral	we will keep them because we will get new textbooks in 0 years .
neutral	not impressed with the plants once they arrived .
neutral	the prices were also too high once we compared them to our local plant house .
neutral	we will not order from this company any more .
neutral	great prices but out of my last 0 orders ... there always something that doesnt ship then i got to email them to get my refund ... shipping is super high compared to other_sites
neutral	good company with a wide_variety of goods .
neutral	had to send my purchase back as it was to large this was at a cost to me of £_00 .
neutral	this has put me of shopping with you again as there are other good company '_s out there who offer free delivery and returns .
neutral	sadly i chose another company to purchase the item i had from you , as sometimes you do have to return items because of the fit .
neutral	being careful is always good , but holding the order waiting for the ve to get back to you deserves a phone_call to the pet_owner .
neutral	in our case we were very short on food and hoping shipment would be prompt .
neutral	we ended_up bothering the vet yet again to ask if there was a substitute food .
neutral	we paid more for the substitute food than what we ordered .
neutral	make_sure you only work with the manager and not the inept weekend staff .
neutral	also be prepared to pay a lot more for your unit than planned in fees and unwanted insurance .
neutral	i paid for next_day delivery but received my order 0 days after i ordered it .
neutral	then when i opened my parcel and tried on the items i had bought .... well , i spent all my birthday money on the order , i got 0 tops and 0 pairs of leggings .
neutral	one pair of leggings is ripped all down the bum , the other pair of leggings fit_perfectly , one top is loose so that one fits but one is the same size as the loose one but it '_s far too tight , and the other top is size 00 but looks like its supposed to fit a toddler .
neutral	it '_s already difficult to find clothing to fit me because i have a large chest , but these clothes are beyond a joke , i got the biggest size which was 00 " chest and one was too loose , one too tight and one won_'_t even go over my head .
neutral	i '_m going to order some dresses and shoes and hope that these are better quality .
neutral	i admit i opted for smartbuyglasses for 0 reasons .
neutral	firstly was the cost which was competetive , and scondly as the pair i wanted were marked on the site as available for fast delivery which was what i needed as i was going on holiday .
neutral	i read their_promises on delivery times carefully to see if it would arrive in time .
neutral	only after i paid did i get an_email to say they were waiting for stock .
neutral	so despite what the site had said when i ordered the raybans that they were available for fast delivery , this proved to be incorrect .
neutral	when i replied to their email they did offer me a different pair at a reduced price , but i did not take them up on the offer as i wanted what i had originally ordered .
neutral	i did get my glasses just in time , and they are the real product and i am very happy with them .
neutral	but if it is important that you get your glasses quicly , do not trust the fast delivery claim as it may not be accurate .
neutral	clearly i had made a typo in the area code of my phone_number but the delivery company really didn_'_t try to find me and it would not have been hard .
neutral	it does seem to be somewhat more difficult to get things delivered to a rural address .
neutral	i wish they would have notified me that one of the movies was not being shipped , it creates a slight mistrust to wait 00 days to find out your not getting all your order
neutral	dr mercola highly_recommended this product .
neutral	it just seemed too expensive for my budget .
neutral	very happy with the parts and their delivery , not so pleased with the help i requested !
neutral	i asked a basic question about did gaskets come with the water_pump .
neutral	partsgeek response was what i expected ," they would research the question and someone would be in contact with me with an answer ".
neutral	i have received and installed the water_pump and still have not received and answer to the my question !
neutral	i can '_t give some of these as presents as the packaging is damaged .
neutral	according to the manager , the delay was due to having only one mechanic show up for work .
neutral	are the working conditions bad ?
neutral	or does mavis need more mechanics ?
neutral	i could tell that the manager was frustrated and he did his best to satisfy me .
neutral	my family has_been going to mavis for twenty - two years .
neutral	recently , my dad has noticed that the service has_been declining .
neutral	wake_up mavis !
neutral	you are going to lose a good customer if you do not get your act_together .
neutral	i had an average experience this past weekend .
neutral	when i arrived , i felt that i was being spoken to like they were drill sargents .
neutral	i told them that it was my first time using this parking company but they didn_'_t seem to change their attitudes knowing that i wasn_'_t used to their operations .
neutral	the man that helped_me inside the office was very mind and helpful with answering_questions and showing me what i had to do upon_arrival .
neutral	although the process was convenient , i was a little troubled with how neurotic the drivers were on the roads .
neutral	they were very aggressive drivers and i was uncomfortable being in a busload of travelers having to hold on to the seat in front of me to stop myself from falling over .
neutral	i purchased the parking voucher through groupon , and had i not done so , i probably_wouldn_'_t have parked there , but i was able to park for 0 days for only $_00 plus taxes and fees .
neutral	that being said , if the time comes where i '_ll need to use their services , i may .
neutral	but only if i would be able to use the groupon prices .
neutral	the quality of my dvds was just fine , but i wouldn_'_t use the free mailing offer again .
neutral	it took way too long to receive them .
neutral	but they haven_'_t been delivered yet , so don_'_t know if the flowers will be nice !
neutral	!.
neutral	thought i had brilliant idea not heard off emma_bridgewater glass before so looked on line and thought brilliant present for friend forty birthday came quickly but size really upset at size
neutral	had trouble getting my card cleared to make the payment .
neutral	had to phone them to sort it .
neutral	when the system finally let_me enter the details i got a message that my recipient '_s name was too long !
neutral	i had to figure_out what to do - no hints from the software .
neutral	had to back arrow several screens to get back to the recipient '_s details and fix it then had to re - enter all delivery instructions and - for the 0th time - re - enter my card details .
neutral	tedious , time_consuming and unnecessary - proper software needed !
neutral	young_lady on the phone sorted card problem quickly .
neutral	i wait to see if delivery part goes_smoothly .
neutral	i love that you will deliver heavy products like litter and dog_food at reasonable delivery and product prices !!
neutral	no one else does that and i hate lugging that stuff home !
neutral	two problems so_far though ... when the litter arrived , it was packaged inside of bigger boxes ( ordered four boxes , came in two_sets of two ) and the bigger boxes were not full so they got smashed in the shipping .
neutral	that in turn crushed the litter box ( ever clean ) and opened the box just enough for litter to leak out .
neutral	usable but messy .
neutral	why not offer these in their original case pack so that i could order them that way and you won_'_t have to repack ?
neutral	secondly , i sent a note to customer_service asking about how i could still use my groupon ( where i learned about you ) b /_c i anxiously ordered this litter before i had the groupon , figuring i could use it the next_day ( had to wait one day to use for some_reason ) on some dog_food .
neutral	the groupon was limited to " new " customers which i was no_longer since i placed that first order on day 0 ... i got a response saying that if i gave them the groupon code , they would credit my account on my next order .
neutral	great !
neutral	problem is that i haven_'_t heard_anything back , though i '_ve written to let them know that no credit has appeared and asked what should i do .
neutral	it '_s been several days now .
neutral	i hope you resolve these sorts of problems -- i signed_up as an ambassador and already have two new customers there for you .
neutral	i need this service , and i know others do , too .
neutral	thanks for asking !

neutral	i paid for express shipping but i i got it about 0 to 0 days_later .
neutral	i was disappointed .
neutral	i liked the price for rental .
neutral	das letzte kleid war mit_dem loch .
neutral	es_ist schrecklich !
neutral	they are now selling so many things other than books , via other sellers around the world like ebay , which is not good and causing problems .
neutral	the toy i ordered in the us site , shipped by a seller from the uk , looks different than the photo being shown .
neutral	i am very disappointed .
neutral	i order from you often , and i love everything i receive .
neutral	i just wish you shipped to military over_seas .
neutral	i pay double shipping because i have it sent to my family , then pay them to send it to my fpo ap box .
neutral	it was fairly slow to be dispatched .
neutral	communication not great .
neutral	however i had the absolute_worst postal experience dealing_with fedex .
neutral	i was supposed to have it delivered for christmas_eve and at 0 . 00pm was told if i wanted it that day i need to come and pick it up myself by 0pm as drivers were busy .
neutral	when arriving i noticed all those in my area had been told to do the same .
neutral	disgusting .
neutral	i note that this was out of vision_direct '_s control but perhaps they may change services .
neutral	very happy with actual product .
neutral	i just placed my first order with you and when i went to my email for confirmation of order i got a warning that you failed some fraud detection .
neutral	i am very concerned as i put my card info out there .
neutral	send me a email concerning this .
neutral	they were nice lights but shame all didn_'_t work
neutral	the actual buying experience was excellent , however , after_reading the exceptions on the mfg .
neutral	warranty , we were rather surprised that one of the warranty exceptions
neutral	was that it not be bought on the internet .
neutral	we did go_ahead and register each of the units , to see if mfr .
neutral	would still cover .
neutral	we would suggest that this type of info .
neutral	should be available when you place the units for sale .
neutral	thank_you ,
neutral	john & shirley barnett
neutral	bought a mirrored bathroom_cabinet .
neutral	on arrival though well_packaged the product was of poor quality , basically in the manufacture .
neutral	screw_holes only partly covered .
neutral	screw caps cross threaded that kind of thing .
neutral	the order arrived very slowly
neutral	i am a ltp club memeber and the last two times i had to wait over 00_minutes to be picked_up .
neutral	both_times i had to call a second time and tell them i was still_waiting .
neutral	i saw every other parking service vans stop and many of them multiple_times , while i stood_out in the freezing_cold waiting .
neutral	what is the point of being a member with quick exit if i have to wait forever to be picked_up ?
neutral	i own 0 cats , 0 dogs , 0 large fish tanks , and one amazon parrot , so most of my pet_supplies are purchased online .
neutral	this was my first purchase with pet_flow , and i have mixed feelings .
neutral	the products from this order was mostly for my dogs , and they loved everything i got them .
neutral	i received my order within 0 days of placing the order !
neutral	that was fantastic !!!
neutral	the only_complaint i have with this company is with their website and the ordering process .
neutral	it took almost two hours to get my order placed !
neutral	you have to scroll and choose your products .
neutral	once you choose the product and add it to your cart , it then takes you back to the very beginning .
neutral	even if you had gone_through 0 pages to get one item , you now have to start everything over .
neutral	my total was about $_00 , and it would have been much larger , but once i took the time to select my items , when i tried to check out , my cart was empty !
neutral	so now i have to start all over !
neutral	ridiculous !!!
neutral	i '_m not sure if i will purchase from them again , but if i do , i '_ll have to save a 0 hour block of time in which to do it .
neutral	took time to collect the car - called a good 00mins in advance and was waiting at_least 00_mins for someone to arrive ( not good when there '_s traffic wardens wandering_around !)
neutral	on return arrival phoned after luggage received was adviced would take 00_mins had to call again after half an_hour as car still not returned ( we returned at 0 in the morning - so not the busiest of times !!)
neutral	was told should be there within 0 / 0 mins but waited a further 00 !
neutral	both agents really could have been anyone as they did not have any identification to who they were / what company they were from !
neutral	however the car was returned as i had left it and was reasonable for the price .
neutral	service was good except for the fact that i was talked to like i didn_'_t know anything .
neutral	and the fact that they took my custom valve stem covers off and didn_'_t put them back on probably threw them alway
neutral	ons weekendje londen was een ervaring , maar wel erg vermoeiend .
neutral	de heen - en terugreis duurde wel heel_erg lang en_het afscheidsdiner had zeker een uur korter gemogen .
neutral	ook_de in onze ogen te strakke tijdsplanning voor_de dagen in londen had flexibeler gekund .
neutral	een half uurtje meer speling voor_het ontbijt was niet erg geweest .
neutral	als laatste minpuntje : een hotel iets dichter bij_het centrum zou zeer gewaardeerd worden door menigeen .
neutral	grote respect voor_de chauffeuse en_de manier waarop zij ons door het zeer drukke londen reed !
neutral	de gids ( annemarie ) voor_de tour was in onze ogen een groot succes .
neutral	met veel enthousiasme en humor vertelde zij over het heden en verleden van_de stad en_het land .
neutral	veel plezier aan beleefd .
neutral	hello ,
neutral	wish you had informed me that my order was a partial shipment .
neutral	three day shipping turned into four days and five days respectively .
neutral	i had my mechanic lined_up but had to cancel my appt because only half of my order was shipped .
neutral	traffic to the airport delayed me by an_hour , meaning i had only around 00_mins to check into my flight , as did many other people arriving at the same time ( aimed for 0 . 00 , got there 0 . 00 ).
neutral	at the bus_stop there is no_indication as to how frequent the buses are or how long it will take to get from the car_park to the terminal .
neutral	after waiting around 00mins at the bus_stop we decided to walk .
neutral	a bus turned_up as we were just leaving the car_park , the driver was very helpful , said it would indeed be quicker to walk ( he was estimating an_hour to get to the terminal because of traffic ) and told us rough directions to get to the terminals .
neutral	however , the car_park was very convenient , only a 00 - 00min walk from terminal 0 and not much further to terminals 0 and 0 .
neutral	booking online saved a fair amount of money compared to turning up on the day , but next time i '_ll be taking the train .
neutral	the train will not only be cheaper but will be much less_stressful .
neutral	your web_site did not say the card had to be processed before it would take two to five " business " days for the card to be delivered .
neutral	i regret paying the extra money for what i thought would be a quick delivery .
neutral	the e_- mail saying the order had been received did infer a processing time would occur .
neutral	i did call about this .
neutral	i will never have a special card made again .
neutral	i liked the swimsuit i purchased , and i liked the price .
neutral	however , once i made the purchase , i started getting multiple_emails every day .
neutral	this was excessive and i called to ask if there was a way to limit the emails to one a week , and i was told that there was nothing they could do about it .
neutral	my solution was to stop all emails from metroswimshop .
neutral	the service from this store was good , the delivery of the item was very quick , however , due to plumber issues we delayed putting up the new shower screen for a few_weeks .
neutral	when i did look at it in detail i noticed it was badly_damaged at one end .
neutral	i contacted them and they got back to me straight_away but after a week of two - ing and fro - ing they said it couldn_'_t be replaced as it was over the 00day refund time by 0 days .
neutral	my own fault , but it was only four days and i wasn_'_t trying to get my money back , just wanted an un damaged item !
neutral	not happy with this lack of understanding .
neutral	i have a huge dog , and buy his food which comes in 00lb_bags .
neutral	i have used petflow a couple of times before this and have frequently found that his food arrives way before time , and i have the issue of how and where to store it .
neutral	other issues have been with pet treats that have been mouldy or arrived in crumb form .
neutral	i love the concept , but have had several instances of disappointment with the reality of the service provided .
neutral	i have only had 0 quotes , not enough to form an opinion .
neutral	the bus_tour was fine .
neutral	we were able to see london and the earphones gave_us all the information we needed .
neutral	i really_enjoyed the boat_trip .
neutral	the tour_guide was very amusing and made it interesting .
neutral	my only_complaint was when we were looking for the bus_stop when we first arrived we were given wrong directions by your employees .
neutral	we walked to a stop and it wasn_'_t in use then they wanted us to walk to covent_garden stop , when we checked with the big_bus company they finally sent us to embankment stop .
neutral	so we lost an_hour looking for a bus_stop .
neutral	shoes were very cute but a size too small .
neutral	i don_'_t understand_why .
neutral	must be made small .
neutral	customer_service is superb , but when i returned a defective , non_- working circuit_board i was told i may get but a fraction of the original cost back .
neutral	i am not too happy about that .
neutral	if i was your company .
neutral	i would get_rid of fed_ex for shipping , they close down shipping goods at a drop of a hat !!!
neutral	you would be better off with ups or usps .
neutral	i think it is a great idea , and the price is better_than the pet_store .
neutral	my concern is that , until there are many users , the dog_food will be sitting on the shelves .
neutral	it has_been my experience in the past that food vendors who do not sell a lot of my brand ( wellness ) have food that is old , and gives my sensitive - stomached dog diarrhea .
neutral	we received our first delivery 0_weeks_ago , and he has had several bouts with the poops .
neutral	i took him to the vet and his temp is good and he is worm - free .
neutral	we just received our second delivery , so hopefully this will not be a problem with this bag , otherwise we will cancel our order with you and go back to purchasing from the pet_store .
neutral	i would recommend but i would say just beware as our first driver who picked us up from faro airport thought he was a formula one driver , he liked to drive as close as he possibly could to any other car , constantly bibbed any car that he thought was driving to slow .
neutral	i got to my hotel in around 00 - 00_minutes .
neutral	my return_journey was so much more pleasant driver was a few_minutes early also picked_up another couple had a nice drive back to the airport which took around 00_minutes .
neutral	very careful driver .
neutral	but shipping options are disappointing .
neutral	i like to send seamless gift_cards as gifts to new parents but unless i pay over $_00 for shipping it does not arrive to them for over a week .
neutral	i love the stethoscope and how well it works .
neutral	however , i ordered the ocean blue which looks sort of like a pearly blue in the picture on your website and its actually more of a really dull baby blue .
neutral	got what i ordered quickly , but it was very poorly packaged and arrived partially opened with some damage to the contents .
neutral	it was fast and very easy .
neutral	lots of products to choose from .
neutral	i received my part fairly quick .
neutral	i would definitely order from them again .
neutral	on our visit to dreams a lovely young_man served_us .
neutral	he has very good customer skills and was extremely polite and helpful .
neutral	unlike his manager .
neutral	i was told to come_back to the store on tuesday to pick_up my free pillows as they were out of stock when i purchased my bed .
neutral	i saw the manager when i arrived at the store and was trying to speak to him about the pillows but he was more interested in his food that his college had just brought for him .... and i was almost dismissed with a wave of the hand as the pillows were not in stock .... still .
neutral	i will phone you when they are in . i had no phone_call so on my 0rd visit to the store and they were still unavailable the manager said i will deliver them for me personally on monday .
neutral	being as he never even asked my mane and address i wondered how he was going to do this !!!!!!!
neutral	anyway i phoned the store on the wednesday and the young_man that served me originally delivered them to my home address .
neutral	i think the manager of this store needs to go on a customer care course ..... or take_lessons from his staff
neutral	i bought 0 ford_fusion tail_lights .
neutral	the driver_side fit perfect !
neutral	the right one has a gap in it .
neutral	it was $_00 a peice when ford factory charged $_000 .
neutral	you save a little money but it doesn_'_t fit_perfectly .
neutral	just a heads up .
neutral	looks just like the old one and a comparible quality .
neutral	this is a great company with a large_selection of items .
neutral	they almost always have what i need at some of the lowest_prices .
neutral	the only problem that i '_ve had with them is their shipping - it '_s ridiculously slow .
neutral	it '_s not just the shipping method that they use - it '_s how long they take to ship .
neutral	i just placed an order today .
neutral	i '_m really hoping that they redeem themselves .
neutral	the prices are worth it , if you ' re not in a bind time - wise .
neutral	the car was excellent -- we rented for two_weeks -- and the price reasonable .
neutral	pickup at the rr station worked very well .
neutral	however , return was a nightmare !
neutral	the street location was unmarked and a very difficult turning from the rr station .
neutral	we went into several parking lots first and then had to go beyond the street and make a difficult turn_around .
neutral	once we had made the correct street entry , it was extremely difficult to find the location to deliver the car .
neutral	it was lucky we had dropped our disabled passenger and luggage to the station first , because there was no service to deliver us back to the station .
neutral	i would recommend that initial return be at the rr station ( with staff there to assist with return to the other location , if necessary ).
neutral	when i received my 0 gallon plants they were very nice in good condition .
neutral	however i paid $_00 a piece and after purchasing found larger nice plants at home_depot and walmart for half the price !!
neutral	mind you the plants i purchased were half off should have been like $&( just too expensive for nothing more than i got .
neutral	container 0 gallon plant size gallon or less
neutral	i sent a mpg and yes approved the design but the quality really wasn_'_t that great
neutral	fast delivery and item as_described but it was a good job it wasn_'_t a gift as the packaging was ripped and broken .
neutral	psrking was great bit booked a valet however got a phone_call 0 mins b0 collecting the car to say the valet wouldn_'_t be finished for 0 hours !!!
neutral	so had to canx this part .
neutral	no nice to come home to a dirty car when expecting a nice clean one !
neutral	overall , the glasses i purchased from global_eyeglasses were great .
neutral	they were all good quality .
neutral	however , i had to return a pair because they were too small even_though the website had said they would fit .
neutral	( the website allows you to input your current measurements to see what will fit .)
neutral	i had to email the company to get the return info too because their form online didn_'_t work at all .
neutral	anyway , i also ordered a pair of prescription_sunglasses .
neutral	now that i have them , they are awesome !
neutral	however , it was several weeks after i ordered that the company finally contacted me and said my initial pair were held up in customs .
neutral	they offered to cancel and refund my order or remake my order with a 00_%_discount off my purchase price .
neutral	it was frustrating having to wait so long , but since i had already received my daily prescription_glasses , i didn_'_t mind waiting .
neutral	so , needless to say , i might consider ordering from this company again .
neutral	a lot of the time when i make purchases with wowcher something goes_wrong .
neutral	either i can '_t make the purchase or when i do the item doesn_'_t turn up and i have to contact wowcher .
neutral	they don_'_t have a personal service , all their e_- mails are of a standard pre_- written format .
neutral	i am now very selective in what i buy from them as i have a low tolerance of inefficiency .
neutral	some of their deals are good but i find that items like towels or bed_linen and generally poor quality .
neutral	you pays your money you takes your choice as they say
neutral	wouldnt use again dissaponted passed around customer_service given the run_around still no instructions
neutral	a bit sweet and does not always mix well .
neutral	but not bad .
neutral	still looking for better low_carb options .
neutral	the package was sent to the wrong_address .
neutral	i had to track it down and fight with the post_office .
neutral	i e_- mailed partsgeek to let them know about the inconvenience and received a response that was very rude .
neutral	it was fine , and i would probably order from them again , but only if things were on sale and the cost of shipping didn_'_t negate the savings .
neutral	photos of items were nice , but descriptions were sparse , i . e .
neutral	dog harness didn_'_t say that it was one size with no adjustment buckles .
neutral	our order was missing an item , and there were no instructions on how to report such .
neutral	price was reasonable and cheaper for some items than other_sites , arranging delivery was easy had a call from a very polite receptionist to arrange a time for delivery which was longer_than the delivery time given on their web_site when ordering .
neutral	was told i would receive a call from delivery driver on the delivery day with a time for delivery but he just tirned up when asked about the call he said he does not call customers as he does not have a company phone to use , the delivery man was not to helpfull and did not want to ingage in conversation with us .
neutral	was pleased with fence panels ordered on delivery although myhusband felt they where flimsy for the money and was expecting them to be a bit more sturdier .
neutral	once panels where treated and put up a few_days_later we noticed that some of the slates of wood on a couple of the panels had started to shrink and that some of the nails had pulled through the wood , leaving big gaps in the panels after nailing these back on we are still left with gaps inbetween some of the slates so not very happt at all as we replaced the fence as the old one was falling to peices and to get some privacy from the neigbours kids , but we now have them peeking through the gaps and poking things through them .
neutral	if i had to replace a fence again i would purchase from somewhere_else that i could go and view panels first to check the quality before purchasing .
neutral	so i ordered a left and right headlight_assembly .
neutral	website said they had them in stock .
neutral	i receive one part 0 days_later , and the other is " out of stock , cancelled ."
neutral	well this stinks .
neutral	i don_'_t want to replace just one .
neutral	why was i not notified before it was shipped ?
neutral	so i sent a detailed message to customer_service , asking if the item was back in stock ( website says there are 00 ), could they refill the order , and what is the status of my charge ?
neutral	all i get is " your card has_been refunded ."
neutral	darned if i know how much has_been refunded , that was never stated in any communications .
neutral	so , here i am .
neutral	one headlight .
neutral	do i reorder and try again , or ship the one i have back ?
neutral	stupid place to put your customer in .
neutral	waiting for glutenflam for months now .
neutral	checked again last night , out f stock .
neutral	i was on a waiting list .
neutral	checked with chat line and wasn_'_t really happy with the customer_service girl .
neutral	she could care less if i went to another site for this .
neutral	finally found what i wanted and ordered it elsewhere .
neutral	not sure if i will come_back .
neutral	not enought carts available , no stairs and creepy people hang out there .
neutral	when we turned in our car at heathrow , the agent for auto_europe began doing the usual walk around .
neutral	it was clear that he was disappointed to not find any major damage .
neutral	soon he was kneeling on the ground , squinting and picking at the passenger_side tires and hubcaps .
neutral	there were the usual minor ( read : hard to see unless you are lying on the ground next to the car ) scratches and dings in the tires / hubcaps .
neutral	he stood up and announced that the damage to the ' wheels ' would need to be charged to my account .
neutral	i was furious and demanded that we speak to a manager .
neutral	while waiting for the manager , we watched this same shameful routine playing out with other customers , most of whom meekly walked_into the office and handed_over their credit_cards .
neutral	when the manager finally arrived , she dismissed us with no comment .
neutral	i smell a rat .
neutral	this company should be ashamed for this kind of evil fund raising .
neutral	the tiles are nice and the delivery was smooth , however i am deeply disappointed with the packaging .
neutral	the tiles have , each one of them , a layer of wax / plastic stuck on top .
neutral	they told me it is applied to avoid them to scratch during transportation .
neutral	of course they need to be protected , however there are better methods to do so .
neutral	i will have to spend hours to clean them before they can be fitted on the wall .
neutral	please think_twice before buying from this seller .
neutral	if you order many you will have to take into account the extra time needed to get reed of the stuff / glue they put on top .
neutral	good luck to anybody in my same situation .
neutral	order went through ok but two_days before funeral ( for which flowers were ordered ) i needed reassurance they would be delivered early , as the funeral was an a . m . one .
neutral	i used the online_chat facility and was initially horrified that the operative said they flowers would get there by 0pm !!
neutral	they went off to ring the florist and said they would check .
neutral	i heard_nothing from them and so had to send an_email to the main sales / customer_service address before it was resolved !
neutral	flowers did get there in time but my blood_pressure was through the roof !
neutral	i have had a hard time redeeming my rewards_points every_single time they become available to use .
neutral	i have called twice already and they still_haven_'_t been credited to my account .
neutral	also i have purchased some dresses that looked nothing like the ones pictured in the website .
neutral	i have used bookbyte before and am usually happy with the services .
neutral	however , i got the standard shipping which takes 0 - 00 business days .
neutral	it took the whole time to get here and based on the standard shipping time from other_sites , i personally think this too long to wait .
neutral	other than that i would recommend this site .
neutral	leadtime for coloured_lenses were very speedy and prices were very competitive .
neutral	delivery however was not so great .
neutral	the lenses were put in a box that is bigger_than an average letterbox .
neutral	hence the package was squeezed through the letterbox , damaged the box and the letterbox !
neutral	its maybe worth using a smaller box as you are shipping a lot of air !
neutral	excellent customer_service from boilerjuice .
neutral	they promised the tanker_driver would call one of the 0 numbers i gave them 0 hour before delivery was due so i could unlock the yard gates to let them in .
neutral	then found card on doorstep saying they had tried to deliver but no one in !!!.
neutral	no phone_call received .
neutral	same thing happened again when they went for a second delivery .
neutral	driver said he wasn_'_t given any numbers to call .
neutral	when i contacted the delivery comaony they said boiler_juice had not given them any additional information .
neutral	unacceptable wait time for 0 tire repl of 00_min , recvd text 0 hrs later to say car ready !
neutral	i am not a person to complain however i have found online shopping frustrating at times .
neutral	my orders seem to get delayed for various reasons , i know that it can not always be helped but it has_been a regular occurence .
neutral	ihave to order at_least two_weeks earlier_than i would have with another pet_food company i use .
neutral	we love our sink .
neutral	when i ordered it , i got a call telling_me that the rinse racks wouldn_'_t be ready to order yet , so i told them to send the sink without the racks and then ship the racks when they were ready .
neutral	a couple weeks passed and i contacted main_faucet to get the rinse racks shipped to me .
neutral	i told them we had moved and gave them the new address .
neutral	i was assured they would be mailed to the new address .
neutral	the rinse racks were shipped and delivered but not to my address .
neutral	i contacted main_faucet twice about this and they were ' supposed to get back to me ' about it both_times .
neutral	so , maybe someone somewhere is enjoying my rinse racks in their sink instead .
neutral	i would really love to have them !
neutral	i absolutely love ami !
neutral	i order quite_often and have been for the most part satisfied with the quality of shoes .
neutral	there are four things i feel could make the shopping_experience with ami much much_better .
neutral	0 .
neutral	shipping rates should be cheaper .
neutral	the discounts and prices are good but what good is 00_%_off when that same 00_% is tacked right back on with shipping rates .
neutral	i do just about all of my clothing and shoe shopping online and most sites offer free or cheap flat_rate shipping with all orders without the use of a discount_code .
neutral	0 .
neutral	better product description - if a shoe runs_small or big it should be noted in the product description .
neutral	also garment sizes - it would not hurt to list the models measurements and the size they are wearing in the picture .
neutral	0 .
neutral	this kind of piggy backs on to number 0 but customer reviews should be visible .
neutral	if i notice a trend in customer reviews on a certain product such as " runs_small , i am normally an 0 but exchanged for a 00 " or " color shown in the picture is much darker in person " this will help customers make a better decision when ordering .
neutral	i have personally ordered shoes in my true size that were much too small and since i did not want to go through the hassle of paying shipping for receiving the original item , paying shipping back to ami , and paying shipping again for the correct size to be sent out i either just tortured my feet and stuffed them into the small shoe or just flat out gave them away .
neutral	0 .
neutral	not a huge gripe but still up there is improved searching .
neutral	all_kinds of stuff pops_up when you type in simply " strappy heels " and it can be quite frustrating when you are looking for one item in particular .
neutral	all in all , i will_continue to shop ami i just hope changes are made soon to make the shopping and buying experience better :)
neutral	order was sent last_week and i brought it to the mechanic and i was told it was the wrong part .
neutral	i was told by partsgeek that i ordered the wrong part but when i go on line to partsgeek it pulls up passenger_side_mirror .
neutral	i should have read real good but didn_'_t so maybe the right side was ordered if it popped_up first .
neutral	why would driver_side_mirror come up when i put in passenger_side_mirror i am not sure ...
neutral	i like the convenience of having the pet_food delivered to my home .
neutral	however , there were a few_times ( too many ) where my order arrived in a less_than timely_fashion forcing me to purchase food until my order arrived .
neutral	my dogs eat the same amount of food daily so overfeeding wasn_'_t the issue .
neutral	the issue was inconsistent in delivery schedule .
neutral	the delivery time_frame " the week of " is not efficient .
neutral	although i adjusted the schedule , the deliveries weren_'_t consistent .
neutral	the point of having pet_food delivered is for convenience and peace of mind .
neutral	in the beginning we were amazed with the diversity of options we had to choose from .
neutral	the woman helping_us was very knowledgable and very patient .
neutral	when we decided to go with an all natural bed_frame we were told that it would take up to 0_weeks for it to be made and delivered to our home .
neutral	we also purchased two couches , that were to come in before 0_weeks and we would have to pay delivery fees .
neutral	delivery for the frame was free .
neutral	three_weeks_later , no bed_frame , and no couches .
neutral	when i called , i was told they could not find my paperwork and that they would have to call me back .
neutral	i did not receive a call .
neutral	once again , i called to get a status_update .
neutral	i was told that the bed_frame had been finished and that it was being shipped to san_francisco .
neutral	then , it would be shipped to los_angeles , followed by a final shipment to long beach .
neutral	why did that happen ?
neutral	no explination .
neutral	why didn_'_t they tell me the frame had been done ?
neutral	why wasn_'_t i told that my couches had been sitting in the los_angeles office way before the bed_frame was finished ?
neutral	again , no explination , no apologies , nothing .
neutral	it seems like once the salesperson sold us over $ 0 , 000 in furniture it didn_'_t matter_how and when we got our goods .
neutral	although i '_m happy with the pieces i purchased i '_m not sure i would recommend the shop to my friends .
neutral	if i did , i would warn them about the logistical difficulties they may have to face before they finally get their stuff .
neutral	btw , you spelled my name wrong .
neutral	diana mendoza not ' mendoz '
neutral	unfortunately i have had several bad_experiences in dealing_with this company , which is why i have rated them in the middle .
neutral	both skirts were washed together at recommended temp and wash cycle .
neutral	one has shrunk .
neutral	poor quality item .
neutral	the hose seem to help but the color - suntan - is not suntan !!!!!
neutral	!
neutral	i haven_'_t seen a differance yet .
neutral	i only have one compaint .
neutral	on the ad .
neutral	it said it came with a gel and there was none , had i known that i would have ordered . i rate this product a 0
neutral	i love the crackers !!!!!
neutral	but i was expecting 0 boxes of 000 / bx not 000 packs of loose crackers ....:(
neutral	good price , delivery spot on , but problem with explaining the instructions for the dishwasher were in swedish .
neutral	e_- mailed after a long conversation with customer_services who tole me to put it in a an e_- mail , but response was after_spending 0 minuted typing problems was what is your problem ........................
neutral	have always had good service from vital_choice except for my last order .
neutral	it arrived as scheduled but half of it had
neutral	thawed which_meant i had to throw half the order away .
neutral	the packing was insufficient , the ice was only on one side of
neutral	the boxes of fish .
neutral	the top and other side had no ice at all .
neutral	i also felt that i should have been told that orders
neutral	shipped to the south could have this problem , then i would not have ordered .
neutral	over all ordering was easy ... but i have not received the gift_card yet .
neutral	hopefully i '_ll receive it before christmas as it is a gift for grandson !!!
neutral	!
neutral	bought new asics trainers , they were a good price , were exactly_what i wanted very comfy on
neutral	pleased with my vision results but aftercare becoming a problem .
neutral	things started well with after care in plymouth , now the closest appointment is in torquay or exeter .
neutral	i have made two appointments in taunton as i was visiting that area but they have both been cancelled due to no optometrist being availble .
neutral	this is most inconvenient as i now have to make a special trip to another area .
neutral	i ordered a vest top and a t - shirt .
neutral	after waiting a week for it to be delivered the t - shirt was a lot shorter_than i thought it would be from the pic and the vest top looked in the pic like it had an embellishment on the collar , which is why i chose it , and i was slightly disappointed that when it arrived it was plain .
neutral	after a week of excitement waiting for my package i was disappointed when it arrived
neutral	couldnt return an item as it was already shipped and it would cost ten_dollars to return .
neutral	bad policy , not hapy .
neutral	great value once you get set_up - but they were unclear ( in my opinion at_least ) on the process to set_up a recurring prescription delivery .
neutral	prices are really attractive and the possibility to book an_appointment online is great .
neutral	the only problem i had is that it took almost 0 hours for a simple mot !
neutral	i really liked the talulah perfume !
neutral	the primavera capsules were amazing - i loved primavera everything !
neutral	but the suki floral body_lotion left a lot to be desired - it smelled awful - like it was rancid .
neutral	the lip_gloss is wonderful - i '_m using it every day .
neutral	we had a lot of paperwork during the process and closing was over two hours long and still didn_'_t have enough documents completed .
neutral	there is a lot of funding issues with who signs what when and it '_s very expensive .
neutral	the prices are really good compare to other_websites .
neutral	however there is a problem with the " contact us " page .
neutral	they should have the email option for those who cannot contact via_telephone .
neutral	ordered a flower_basket and wine to be delivered to my daughter as a surprise in australia .
neutral	flora_queen said that they couldn_'_t find the address and telephone_number given .
neutral	i had to ring my daughter from the uk to check address and telephone_number which turned_out to be correct !
neutral	the flowers and wine were delivered the next_day by the same company who the day before said the details were incorrect !
neutral	also the flower_arrangement was nothing like the one on the website .
neutral	from the order and each day got updates on how the shipment was coming .
neutral	all was great .
neutral	the item upon_receipt was inspected and the warranty covered everything except the grommets .
neutral	i unpackaged the cover and the grommets were less_than satisfactory .
neutral	some were crushed ( folded and could not run line through ) others were not placed on the cover properly ( the grommets were not completely on the fabric ).
neutral	this appears to be a second rate pool_cover and i have to cover my pool now .
neutral	i feel those should have been inspected before shipping .
neutral	i am not willing to pay for shipping and take the chance of getting a second faulty cover .
neutral	i appreciate your updates on shipping but the quality of the product is not what i expected .
neutral	i will not order products again through this site .
neutral	the first time i ordered something from the website , it did not label that the items i wanted were out of stock so i waited for a week and realized they didnt ship anything yet so i emailed them .
neutral	took them 0 days to reply and tell me items were out of stock and that they already canceled my order and refunded my money .
neutral	i got a full_refund within a week so i was happy and ordered from them again
neutral	[ 0 / 00 / 0000_] this time they sent me an_email 0 [ 0 / 00 / 0000_] days_later to tell me my items were shipped with a tracking_number that didnt work .
neutral	i emailed them about it and they said that they had to check with the shipping company to see if they lost my package or what not .
neutral	after 0 days [ friday 0 / 00 / 0000_] i called them to tell them the tracking_number still doesnt work and they told me to wait til monday [ 0 / 00 / 0000_] to see if the tracking_number works .
neutral	today is saturday [ 0 / 00 / 0000_] and i checked the tracking_number and it worked and it said the item was picked_up on 0 / 00 / 0000 at 0 :_00pm which_means when they said they have already shipped the package , they haven_'_t .
neutral	it was probably already given a tracking_number but not shipped yet .
neutral	but i received all my items in the correct sizes i ordered .
neutral	my friend ordered from them more than once and every time she ordered she got her package within 0 days of ordering .
neutral	i think its more of a chance thing if you ' re willing to take it
neutral	it took ami more than a week to process the order before it was shipped .
neutral	i called and i was told that there was a technical problem .
neutral	anyways , the boots itself came ok .
neutral	it was kinda dusty even_though it was in the package and i had to wipe the dust away .
neutral	there were a few inches of yellowish glue stains on the zip as well ...
neutral	do your homework on the wowcher you want to purchase as i had a problem with one of mine custoner service wouldnt help i sent emails and not heard a thing regarding a refund i mite as well have thrown my money down a drain as when i tried to redeem the wowcher the salon concerend were vile and nasty so i couldnt have the wowcher id purchased so was very upset and angry that wowchrer head_office wouldnt help me just be careful where you shall be redeeming the wowcher especially beauty salons coz once purchased theres no turning back good luck !
neutral	i ordered a playstation game card and the code was in within the 00_minutes like they had mentioned but i was disappointed when the code did not work .
neutral	i immediately send an_email and got no response .
neutral	i am now out 00 $ and have no card .
neutral	not very happy with the service .
neutral	hoping a response soon :(
neutral	* got a telephone response not long after my comment .
neutral	things were resolved !
neutral	as a consumer i was surprise about the price of the storage .
neutral	is a dollar the first month
neutral	not truth .
neutral	martha
neutral	i recently_purchased a janome gem platinum . i had purchased my full sized janome from you a long time ago .
neutral	your service was very efficient , however , the carrier left a message to say they had been unable to deliver as no - one was at home , this was not true , he could not have been here without opening our farm gate to turn round , with 0 labradors in the yard we always know when someone has arrived !
neutral	! i tried to get in touch with gur and was told all the lines were engaged and to leave my name and number and someone would get back ... still_waiting , 00 days_later !
neutral	i managed , with some difficulty , to contact the carrier who said the driver could not find us , usually they phone if having_trouble , however , he found us the next_day with no further instruction !
neutral	!
neutral	i had to cancel a part of my order because somehow when i went to click on the particular item , it ended_up giving me the wrong isbn #.
neutral	okay , not the first time such things have happened ( still don_'_t know how but whatever ).
neutral	i noticed it immediately after having placed the order .
neutral	unfortunately , there is no such thing as a partial exchange even if the item has yet to ship .
neutral	so , i had to cancel that part of my order off and i am still_waiting for the refund to hit my bank_account .
neutral	it has_been about a week and a half i would say ,
neutral	other than that , yeah , hey why not ?
neutral	they are alright i guess .
neutral	i booked the morning slot from 0 . 00 - 0 and waited in all morning .
neutral	about 00 . 00 i got a call saying they would be late and needed to stop somewhere_else on the way so would be about 0 before they were with me .
neutral	this was unaaceptable as i had to go out .
neutral	they did eventually come just after 0 as i said i had to get them done asap and could not wait in again the next_day and needed to go out that afternoon .
neutral	the changing of the tyres was fine but i would have prefered a call much earlier as then i could have re arrnaged my day rather_than staying in abd then not getting out until much later .
neutral	a lot of research necessary to check on firms .
neutral	shiply could have their own rating_system and checks which would aid the customer .
neutral	at the moment it seems geared to carriers and themselves .
neutral	on positive side i was " lucky " enough to get a top rate carrier but only after doing my own research .
neutral	after checking the dimensions of the desk i purchased i was convinced that the desk would up the two flights of stairs and the delivery_men would take it up .
neutral	little did i know that the delivered box was much wider than the desk and the box was left downstairs in the middle of the dining_room !!
neutral	disappointing or what ?!!
neutral	!
neutral	i was happy to try my first purchase with petflow , however due to the length of time it took to ship my order , i doubt that i will purchase again .
neutral	the order was placed on saturday but didnt ship till wednesday .
neutral	no reasons were provided .
neutral	customer_service sucks
neutral	the estimated time of arrival was spot on , very pleased as i needed my new skinnies for the day after !
neutral	slightly dissapointed with the material ... wasn_'_t what i expected .
neutral	however , i know i '_ll wear them again !
neutral	we had a problem with the car and autoeurope spain told me they ' d have me a new car within an_hour .
neutral	they called 00_minutes later to say they ' d call back in 00_minutes .
neutral	two hours_later they called again .
neutral	by that time we had fixed the problem so i didnt ' answer the phone .
neutral	if the problem had been more serious you would have truly runied our vacation .
neutral	i am still_waiting for my last order and i '_m sort of angry that it has taken so long ...
neutral	this is not normal for kimball .
neutral	i need a working contact number i ordered two tickets to ultra music festival weekend 0 and they haven_'_t even been picked_up by ups yet .
neutral	the concert is on fri march 00 and that is only a few_days away
neutral	trans :_0000000
neutral	trans :_0000000
neutral	i need these tickets !
neutral	and a working customer_service number !
neutral	----
neutral	update_:_0000000 has_been shipped but what about 0000000 ?
neutral	?
neutral	hit and miss buying from boohoo , sometimes the items are great but the other half of the time the items are cheap tat .
neutral	getting the refund always seems to take_forever aswell !
neutral	what a good service , quick , and very efficient , staff were polite and knowledgable about their products
neutral	the coffee is good , but the lever of my nespresso_machine is difficult to pull down .
neutral	i don_'_t_believe the capsule is tight .
neutral	it is most_likely the cover that is too hard to puncture .
neutral	also , i wish you had a longo decaffinated .
neutral	i certainly appreciate the cost of the capsules , the savings are great .
neutral	website failed as i was paying , received no confirmation , rang them , confirmed but never got the email ...... when forwarded confirmation of delivery came it had no time window for delivery , no tracking_number , and no details of who courier was ..... tracking_number was then sent .
neutral	they use nightfrieight as a courier who do not allow you to track your delivery via their website .
neutral	the product we bought was excellent though .,
neutral	saw the hotel we wanted at a reasonable price including breakfast , went to book and up popped a " better deal " a fair bit cheaper .
neutral	great i thought so hit the book button .
neutral	when i got the confirmation through it did not mention breakfast so i rang the hotel to check .
neutral	no , breakfast wasn_'_t included .
neutral	give me a great price by all means but not a different booking from the one i was on .
neutral	wish i could review your service but i still_haven_'_t received the card i ordered
neutral	doesn_'_t taste like food .
neutral	good customer_service but the product just isn_'_t for me
neutral	i did my part with the measurements and payment .
neutral	you did not do yours with ensuring my glasses arrived at the very least , tightened .
neutral	spent nearly_£_000 with your company and made that many calls to 0000 to arrange delivery and sort out .
neutral	dealt_with lady called anne .
neutral	wouldnt recommend in the future to be honest especially when you have cheek to charge £ 0 . 00 delivery when you miscommunicated regarding the day etc .
neutral	appalled .
neutral	spent nearly_£_000 and thanks you get
neutral	after ordering a 00m multi coloured ropelight to brighten_up the decking for christmas , the order process and speed of processing / delivery was excellent .
neutral	but unravelling 00m of ropelight from a reel was quite difficult as it was tightly coiled , and then after i had got it into position it was time for the big switch on - oh dear .
neutral	a 0m stretch right in the middle where the blues and yellows do not light up .
neutral	i '_m not taking it down now !
neutral	if it wasn_'_t for this would have given 0 or even 0_stars , but products should be checked before they are dispatched .
neutral	rueckblickend auf das studium fuehlte ich_mich bei_der ihk - pruefung ein wenig verloren und nicht genug auf_den test vorbereitet .
neutral	ich_habe die pruefung mit zwei berufschulklassen abgeschlossen und_habe in den pausen grosse unterschiede bemerkt .
neutral	zum ersten hatten die berufschullehrer ihre berufsschueler alles was die ihk - pruefer nicht moegen bis ins tiefste detail eingehaemmert und besonders hervorgehoben , welche satzanfaenge zu vermeiden waeren , da die pruefer diese " langweilig " finden .
neutral	eine der prueferinnen war sogar eine berufschullehrerin von einer der zwei klassen .
neutral	zum zweiten hatte das woerterbuch , das von_der sgd vorgeschrieben wurde mindestens zwei woerter nicht aufgelistet und_es_war mir unmoeglich diese woerter zu uebersetzten , eines davon war photovoltaik .
neutral	in der berufsschule wird das groesste woerterbuch von ponds benutzt und_es kostet um die 00_euro .
neutral	ausserdem moechte ich noch vermerken , dass fast alle lernhefte fehler enthalten .
neutral	z . b .
neutral	stand in einem englischen geschaeftsbrief das deutsche wort " datum ".
neutral	die fehler lenken sehr ab_und_es faellt schwer sich auf das wesentliche zu konzentrieren .
neutral	more or less happy with service , prompt , efficient and good value .
neutral	i registered and did a dummy run on my laptop in bulgaria with no_probs .
neutral	came to uk - no laptop just a smart phone , what a balls ache .
neutral	not being a techno freek , basically a bit of numpty having to prove my id and take photos was a nightmare .
neutral	luckily i had documents with me too .
neutral	hi there , delivery was late0 day no information given about that no email no calls then the driver didnt say a word to me gave_me this thing to sign off and went in silence but never mind bed is lovely just one thing more no invoice i need it pls ;)
neutral	overall the items seem excellent despite_being expensive .
neutral	unfortunately my dogs ( beagles ) can pull down the sides and get into the side compartments exposing the wires and getting dog fur everywhere .
neutral	we will have to look for alternative solutions as this does not securely protect the boot .
neutral	prior information about purchasing the auto glym silicone remover would have been useful .
neutral	ordering options online were good .
neutral	email_notifications of status of order was good until it said " is processing " - i heard_nothing back since then december_0th and called on the 00th to find out the status .
neutral	it was shipped united_states postal so there wasn_'_t any tracking and was told it should be received by my local post_office between the 00th and the 00th .
neutral	that seems like a long time to receive a gift_card .
neutral	i ordered a gift_card from amazon and had it in my hands within a weeks time and was able to track the shipping .
neutral	i probably will not order from gift_cards again .
neutral	i booked a last_minute hotel and didn_'_t receive a confirmation_email .
neutral	i paid with paypal and that '_s the only email i received .
neutral	when i phoned the next_day to inquire , the guy on the phone told me to check my spam_folder .
neutral	duh , i had done that prior to calling !
neutral	he then sent me the confirmation_email , and i went to my hotel .
neutral	they couldn_'_t locate my reservation .
neutral	ends_up it wasn_'_t under my name .
neutral	it was under bookit ; not sure if that '_s a bookit or this specific hotel thing .
neutral	i received a confirmation_email later that day ( after i had checked into hotel ), so i '_m guessing confirmations don_'_t go out live ...?
neutral	will probably give them another try down the road since the guy on the phone was so polite and tried so hard to be helpful .
neutral	in the process of building , we rented three 00 x 00 stalls and have paid on auto pay for the last 0 or 0 months .
neutral	we were promised the same rate if we needed another stall .
neutral	i called yesterday to rent a fourth stall and found out there was a new manager .
neutral	he would not honor the promised rate that we have .
neutral	this is mainly for people who have several pets and need a lot of supplies .
neutral	for the majority of people who have only one pet , it gets a little_disappointing when all the promotions are only for repeat orders .
neutral	it sure is nice to get pet stuff delivered to the door , though !
neutral	love the fact that i don_'_t have to make a stop after work .
neutral	it '_s delivered to my office and i just have someone load it into the car .
neutral	very easy .
neutral	it usually goes well but this delivery was shipped a day late and then took 0 days to get here .
neutral	normally they are here on time .
neutral	delivery points are awesome ... wish seamless had those .
neutral	that '_s probably one of two reasons i use delivery . com .
neutral	the other is the $ 0 off $_00 regular coupon offer .
neutral	i don_'_t like the way the app looks and theat you can '_t search for food items .
neutral	also the checkout is super annoying too - i would like to be able to set a cc to auto fill in .
neutral	pros_:
neutral	- has the most diverse selection of hostels out of any other hostel booking site
neutral	- many many honest reviews by backpackers like me , so the ratings are pretty reliable
neutral	cons_:
neutral	- does not save your isic info by hostelworld account , and have to open up a new window to use isic service fee waiver every time
neutral	- if you accidentally refresh the page , the dates change to today '_s date .
neutral	which is extremely annoying because you have to reinsert the dates all the time .
neutral	- maps section sometimes shows the hostel in a different location than when you type on google_maps .
neutral	also would be very convenient if you could click on the hostelworld map and it would open up a google_maps version in a new window
neutral	the mattress was delivered promptly on the allocated day .
neutral	the delivery man asked me to inspect the mattress which was wrapped in 0 layers of thick polythene with no tears or damage .
neutral	however , upon removing the packaging , there was a small_hole in the top of the mattress .
neutral	it seems that your quality control systems may not be working effectively .
neutral	i have ordered from them three_times .
neutral	i like the clothes for the price .
neutral	the first time no_problems but the shoes i ordered the second were out of stock so they didn_'_t send them .
neutral	they didn_'_t send my money back nor did they credit anything to my account .
neutral	customer_service keeps telling_me they are working on it but so_far with little success
neutral	i ordered two bags of dog_food .
neutral	they arrived on time but the shipping carton was heavily damaged .
neutral	it had been repaired with tape somewhere in its journey .
neutral	the potential for a kibble disaster was high .
neutral	i will order from petflow again and hope the problem has_been solved .
neutral	the delivery and ordering was fast and easy but the glue on the bonded extensions melts when i dry my hair !!
neutral	!
neutral	had to put my details on card in five times as kept sticking , had to add address details twie as removed them !
neutral	frustrating ,
neutral	the ink that i ordered came in the mail quickly .
neutral	unfortunately , only the color ink was the correct one .
neutral	the black_ink was wrong and did not work in my printer .
neutral	the checkout_process took so long , one of my gift_cards was purchased by the time i was able to check out .
neutral	the search process is really annoying too .
neutral	ordered both fridge and freezer , booked a delivery date and was alloocated a time between 00pm and 0pm .
neutral	what time do they turn up ?
neutral	at around 0 . 00 .
neutral	didnt even call to say running_late and when arrived no apology made either .
neutral	two men turned_up , one said hello while the other didn_'_t even ackhnowledge me .
neutral	i ordered the ken bomber ladies jacket from your website unfortunately it was too small on the arms and the large was not available . cant find it in any stores so maybe last seasons .
neutral	when i went to the shop to return it they said i could only exchange here and had to send back by post for a refund .
neutral	when i went to the post_office i was very unhappy to realise i had to pay over_£ 0 in postage to guarantee you received it .
neutral	superdry should offer a free refund .
neutral	mit_der qualität der lieferung war_ich sehr_zufrieden , aber habe die vorauszahlung am tag der_bestellung direkt gemacht und musste dennoch drei wochen warten nach zwei mal nach fragen , das war nicht so schön
neutral	i think the web_site is slower and i don_'_t like the new system with picking a hotel prior to seeing what flight is being offered when you are checking a flight and hotel package .
neutral	i am very happy with the vehicle i got from drive time it just took entirely too long like a 0 hour process .
neutral	the people who were working that day were leaving to go home before my husband and i left to go home .
neutral	i love your products , prices and speak offers but i have been severely impacted and disappointed in the shipping process .
neutral	the routes are good bit the commentary was virtually non_- existent .
neutral	the info is the main_reason_why we go on the buses but we spent 00_% of the journey listening to music on the on board pre recorded_commentary .
neutral	there is so much history in london you should be struggling to work out what to leave out not what to say !
neutral	ticket number 000000 . amount to credit 00 . 00 plus tax please give immediate attention .
neutral	thank_you
neutral	i had to return two collars that were the wrong_size .
neutral	they did the return / exchange for the correct size but failed to mention there would be an_additional_charge on my account .
neutral	the charge was actually les than the original order and actually i should have just gotten a credit of 0 dollars ..
neutral	however , no one informed me of this happening and it was an unpleasant surprise .
neutral	to mention i am still_waiting for the original 00_dollar order to be credited_back to may account .
neutral	it '_s great shopping_experience .
neutral	but deilver bit_slow
neutral	quick shipping of ink , but i ordered two black and received 0 black and 0 color .
neutral	once notified , they provided a shipping label to return the color_cartridge and immediately send out the black one .
neutral	..... but i am a little_concerned that i am still yet to receive my policy documents .
neutral	well ....
neutral	i can '_t give the ink a good review ...... but i can say the customer_service is fantastic !!!
neutral	!
neutral	i still have not received my sunglasses .
neutral	it was not a good experience sending back my original package .
neutral	i paid s / h and it wasn_'_t cheap then it took_forever to get back .
neutral	too long of a wait for me .
neutral	i will not be ordering here again .
neutral	sorry 😣
neutral	i went into my account & changed my auto order right after the last order arrived .
neutral	last time i made the mistake of ordering large_breed food , but i figured since it was my mistake , i ' d just use it .
neutral	the postage to return the bag was too much .
neutral	but the large_breed food was sent again this time , with no attempt to see that the orderwas correct before sending out the auto shipment .
neutral	i am not happy .
neutral	i wish i could get a refund
neutral	after the long wait on hold the service was very kind and efficient .
neutral	i enjoyed the products purchased , and they arrived in good shaped , very quickly .
neutral	however , the shipping was more than the products .
neutral	hate that .
neutral	feel_like you want to catch travvellers with bi handluggage but you miss so many check everybody or nobody .
neutral	i had a regular handbag and my husband a carryback so we had no problem but felt bad because you had no stabil police
neutral	i have order from you several_times .
neutral	this is the first time i have received my merchandise without_having to e_- mail you about not receiving it !
neutral	i liked my order but it took a week to receive .
neutral	i didn_'_t realize the company was on the west_coast .
neutral	i live in nj and will probably go with a company that is closer .
neutral	you sent my order promptly , but apparently you think that one order gives you permission to load my email inbox with stupid and unwanted emails .
neutral	please take me off your email list .
neutral	also , i found that your dog_food was probably more_expensive than my local_pet_store , with postage added .
neutral	i cannot buy huge amounts at one time to save postage as i am elderly and cannot lift_heavy_bags .
neutral	so , i will probably not order from you again .
neutral	i think it '_s a pain having to sign for your tire , you should have the option to click to leave with out signature .
neutral	some people can '_t sit and wait for the tire to show up .
neutral	i bought a dozen roses bouquet with fillers and a vase .
neutral	everything arrived on time , but the flowers were not as in the picture .
neutral	they were small and the never opened .
neutral	love the beads , etc .
neutral	and the service .
neutral	the shipping was confusing .
neutral	i thought i had chosen the pouch shipping and i think the items would have fit .
neutral	but when i looked at the invoice you had applied the most expensive shipping .
neutral	i probably will shop around next time to get a better shipping rate .
neutral	again , your service was great except for shipping_costs .
neutral	one of my gift_cards never arrived , and was not showing as having been used , yet to replace it i was charged a fee .
neutral	unfair .
neutral	i liked the products when i saw them on screen but one was very different when i tried it on and so i sent it back .
neutral	others were ok , luckily they were on sale as i would never pay the full price for them !
neutral	initially the man_who answered the phone was nice but seemed to suffer from adhd .
neutral	i had to repeat things several_times such as how many months i needed the storage , i told him four different times how long .
neutral	i explained the items i had and we had to go thru piece by piece .
neutral	the phone_call took a lot longer_than it needed to .
neutral	i just wanted some info .
neutral	i also felt_like he thought i was an_idiot and needed to explain to me very basic things .
neutral	the purchasing process was easy and i thought i had found the site i would use as i frequently buy gift_cards for family .
neutral	but , after the card was delivered to my grandson , his mother had difficulty activating the card .
neutral	i tried_calling and going on line .
neutral	when i finally talked to a call_center representative , i was given improper instructions and was told to ' register ' the card before activating .
neutral	i explained to her that these instructions were not provided either online or with the card that was sent .
neutral	in fact when you click the register menu , it takes you to a page to set_up a new online account .
neutral	this should not be required to activate a card , but only to purchase a card .
neutral	we finally figured it out and was able to activate the card online .
neutral	for improvement , your call menu tree should be modified to more clearly take you to what to do to activate a card and there was no code put in the mail to me as the purchaser even_though this was the information provided .
neutral	also , customer_service representatives should be better trained and able to answer basic questions .
neutral	the bus_tour in itself was good , it captured all the main_sights , but the audio commentary was awful , as other reviews have stated full of static and incomprehensible .
neutral	i do not like that you charged my credit_card for two_nights the day that i called to make reservations .
neutral	normally you hold the card number and do not charge unless it is a no show or the person arrives .
neutral	i called to cancelled my reservation due to change in plans and i was told that it would take 00 - 00 days before the credit would show on my card .
neutral	this is wrong on so many levels !!!!!!!!!
neutral	!
neutral	i '_ve purchased some wonderful clothing for my husband , but shipping seemed bit_slow .
neutral	one of the items wasn_'_t in stock and i didn_'_t realize it when checking out .
neutral	quick and easy
neutral	front staff ladies , very pleasant .
neutral	rooms were very cleaned .
neutral	it '_s a good hotel for a good price !
neutral	wifi was horrible , so wasn_'_t able to get any work done .
neutral	get your money back .
neutral	we called at 0 : 00_pm the day before a night walking_tour through chinatown , and by my calculations , it was 00_hours before the trip , but by viators calculations it was not .
neutral	i was on vacation and i didn_'_t want to fight , but i have to tell you , it left a sour taste in my mouth , considering we had booked 0 trips through viator .
neutral	we are now going to los_angeles in august , and i '_m not totally sure that i will book through viator .
neutral	i actually sent an_email with a question about pick - up at my hotel .
neutral	i received a confirmation and was told someone would get back to me .
neutral	no one did .
neutral	so , as you can see , i '_m having my doubts as to whether i want to give my money to them , when there '_s plenty of other tour companies .
neutral	i thought the spoiled_rotten boxes should be more " customized ".
neutral	small dogs and breeds can '_t handle large items .
neutral	any rawhide product is scary for small dogs .
neutral	despite advertising free delivery to all of the u . k .
neutral	i was charged £_00 for delivery !
neutral	this is because aberdeen is now in the highlands & islands - apparently .
neutral	it '_s not , it '_s in aberdeenshire .
neutral	i dislike the sneaky way i was charged .
neutral	when i put the order through , there was no mention of a charge , it was only about 00_minutes later i got an_email through telling_me my order wouldn_'_t ship unless i paid delivery .
neutral	and when i tried to pay it online it also charged me an extra £ 0 . 00 to pay for the bonus of the " free delivery "!
neutral	having brought an expensive tent costing £_000 . 00 , i am not happy with the false_advertising .
neutral	first , a little background .
neutral	i needed to make a reservation for 0 rooms to host a small family_reunion in shawnee mission , ks .
neutral	as i visited numerous sites , i realized that rooms were filling up quickly .
neutral	so i reserved 0 rooms and asked the agent if these room would be refundable if i did not need them all .
neutral	as of now i still do not know for sure how many are coming .
neutral	i '_ll be i asked the agent that question 0 times and each time he said " yes ."
neutral	after i hung_up and received the confirmation_email , i noticed that it said " nonrefundable ."
neutral	so i called ( it was a different number from the original number because it was a question about a reservation .)
neutral	and talked to a different agent .
neutral	he asked me several_times if the first agent had read me the cancellation_policy and i told him he had not .
neutral	i hope to need to keep all the rooms , but if not , i will be asking for a refund .
neutral	and i expect to receive it .
neutral	es sollten auch gutscheine nach gemachtem umsatz verschenkt werden !
neutral	lige et_par tanker i punktform :
neutral	- jeres telefonkø er uacceptabel .
neutral	fortæl i det mindste folk , hvad nummer de er i køen !
neutral	- det_er fint at i er flittige til at svare folk her i trustpilots forum , men_det virker useriøst , når det bare er_en sludder for en sladder .
neutral	lad være med at svare , medmindre i har noget vigtigt at tilføje , en decideret undskyldning fx .
neutral	- jeg finder jeres netforbindelse tilfredsstillende for det meste , men i perioder er den ustabil , men så_er i søde til at hjælpe med_en løsning .
neutral	- jeg_synes i skulle tilbyde en løsning så_man_kan bruge googles chromecast .
neutral	vær med på moden !
neutral	jeg_er_en helt almindelig pige der kan lide god lyd .
neutral	jeg_er_ikke super til at lave ting selv , og_jeg ved ikke alt om hi -_fi .
neutral	jeg_skulle købe en pladespiller og en blu - ray - afspiller , og blev mødt af_en noget dum - smart sælger i hi -_fi - klubben odense , jeg tænkte ... han hører faktisk mere hjemme i fona eller ekspert , ikke i saglige hifi - klubben .
neutral	næste gang skulle jeg så afhente min pladespiller , og købte en bedre pickup med .
neutral	jeg spurgte om den var nem at sætte på selv .
neutral	" ja , ja , " lød det korte svar .
neutral	jeg spurgte mere ind til_det , og_fik at vide at der lå værktøj i kassen til_det .
neutral	da_jeg kom hjem , viste det sig , at det_ikke var så nemt .
neutral	jeg_var faktisk lidt ked af at han ikke tilbød at skifte pickuppen for mig , det ville have taget ham 0 minutter .
neutral	jeg_synes ikke sælgerne i hi -_fi klubben odense er professionelle og venlige mod kunderne , men måske er_det fordi_jeg_ikke_er " hi -_fi " nok ..?
neutral	site was good , a bit dissappointed that we have to wait_until may for the delivery .
neutral	but we can live with that .
neutral	only_thing that is disturbing is they keep sending us emails saying our basket is still open - but we '_ve paid and been invoiced .
neutral	i don_'_t understand this , twice_now next time i '_ll be phoning them .
neutral	i ordered a case for my ipad_mini .
neutral	i ordered it before i preordered the mini ( one week before mini released ).
neutral	the ipad came last friday .
neutral	it '_s monday , and snugg is asking for a review .
neutral	the cover won_'_t be here until wednesday .
neutral	i can '_t review the case , but i '_m already disappointed that my ipad has no case , yet .
neutral	honestly , if i had known it would take so long , i would have just waited and ordered a different case from somewhere_else .
neutral	this snugg was only offered in black , but i accepted that because i thought it would be here at the same time as my ipad .
neutral	i probably would have ordered a different color ... but too late now .
neutral	update_: the case did arrive later on monday .
neutral	it '_s actually pretty nice .
neutral	however , there is a letter stating that apple moved the magnets at the last_minute , so the ' smart cover ' aspect doesn_'_t work at this time .
neutral	they promise to send a revised ( fully functioning ) version in the next 00 days , this case , so_far , is for protection ... and i won_'_t have to return it when the new one arrives .
neutral	nice_touch & the rating is getting better .
neutral	the black is alright .
neutral	i do wish it came in other colors , but this will do .
neutral	we '_ll see if / when the 0nd case arrives .
neutral	update 0 : the replacement case arrived today .
neutral	it was a little more than 00 days , but the new case is just the same , but now the smart cover feature works .
neutral	regardless of whatever timing issues i had , the case is a good quality and feels nice .
neutral	l did not get any kosher meals on all flight as l don_'_t eat everything .
neutral	when i called the company the man taking the order was extremely polite and helpful , he took the order and explained what was going to happen next .
neutral	great i thought , going well .
neutral	the company used for the delivery were most unhelpful and when my husband spoke to the girl in their office she was very rude and obviously in the wrong job , as she had no communication_skills whatsoever .
neutral	the delivery man was a jobsworth and didn_'_t have 0 ounce of flexability .
neutral	the bathroom that we ordered was fine everything as it should be , which is what we had paid for .
neutral	i suggest a different delivery company is used by betterbathrooms or feedback will always be negative .
neutral	there were ants coming from under the door jam in the bathroom .
neutral	and if you can believe it , there were ants near and in the pool !
neutral	so my kids were commenting on swimming with the ants .
neutral	breakfast was okay , only cheerios and raisin bran for cereal and thin dried out sausage patties ... not awful , but we expected better for the price .
neutral	i feel good with the service but bookbyte is always making promises about return it a percentage of the payments but i never receive it .
neutral	i '_ve rented at about 0 books and nothing :(
neutral	this time i had a minor change to make to my business cards in that i wanted to add my email address .
neutral	whilst i appreciate a minor change still constitutes a change the order was not progressed automatically at all and was missed by my local team .
neutral	when i chased it 0 days_later i was sent a proof and they had used the incorrect email address , despite my amendment notes showing the correct address .
neutral	in fairness they didn_'_t charge me for the change , but there was no urgency at all and no offer to deliver the cards that finally were ready a week late .
neutral	i dealt_with a different person to the member of staff that usually deals with my printing , and i must_say that the experience could not have been more different .
neutral	usually i receive excellent service and was disappointed that i felt as though i was an inconvenience on this occasion , it has made me reconsider using printing . com in future just in case i have to deal with this person .
neutral	had to call twice after waited 00_minutes without bus .
neutral	when i told dispatcher i was waiting under the sign stated on my ticket , he said they were in fact using another spot for pick ups .
neutral	he was very apologetic , which was nice , but it was cold .
neutral	also , i could not help but notice that three of the parking_spot '_s buses came by as i was waiting in the cold .
neutral	i got my struts 0 days after i order them .
neutral	haven_'_t installed then yet . i will let you know how it goes .
neutral	i placed my order july 00 , 0000 , and as for today , july 00 , i have not received my sunglasses !
neutral	the sway bar links that i ordered did not seem to be installable .
neutral	there was no spot for the hex key in the end of the bolt and there was no flat spot for a wrench .
neutral	i googled the part number and it wasn_'_t the part that i got .
neutral	the search_results showed a much more substantial rubber bushing , this part has more of a flexible rubber dust cover .
neutral	i had already attempted to install the part so decided_against trying to return it .
neutral	in the end i was able to install it after i purchased an impact wrench and socket , so this was no deal .
neutral	it was nice to be able to purchase a seamless gift_card , but the fees were too high , i was unable to print the gift_card on my computer and the shipping fees were exorbinant .
neutral	for a $_000 gift_card , i paid almost $_00 in fees !
neutral	will not order from giftcards . com again .
neutral	i placed an order online one day , and the following_day i was called to sign_up for auto_ship .
neutral	i did say okay .
neutral	but they auto shipped me from the last time i ordered back in may .
neutral	which gave_me a double order , and a double payment .
neutral	so they took double out of my checking_account .
neutral	i do not have a lot of funds in my checkbook .
neutral	so , i was not able to pay another bill on time .
neutral	you are making me wait for my refund until you receive the order back that i did not order .
neutral	i immediately gave it back to fed_ex .
neutral	with the prepaid_label .
neutral	i was told that before an auto_ship i would be notified so i could change an order .
neutral	i immediately cancelled all future auto ships .
neutral	i am very dissatisfied .
neutral	i am healthy and slim with a waist of 00 inches , my lower belly is 00 inches and underbust is about 00 .
neutral	i had got a size 00 inch corset and it is way too tight .
neutral	even when i lace to 00 inches , i feel_like i '_m gonna die .
neutral	these corsets are not made for grown women .
neutral	:( the corset i had gotten is " my - 000 - green brocade underbust " it is cute though
neutral	got a call today from cheryl and i guess there was a misunderstanding about the insulin syringes i ordered .
neutral	she was very nice and said they would reimburse_me for the shipping .
neutral	the needles that were sent were the standard veternarian needles not the ones for insulin and she appoliged for that .
neutral	in the future i would order from them because they really seemed like they wanted to make the mistake right again which i appreciate .
neutral	the package was delivered quickly and everything was taken_care of in a very timely_manner .
neutral	seems like a good company to do_business with & they care about their customers .
neutral	really pleased with the items i ordered .
neutral	good price and good quality .
neutral	just disappointed with the delivery service as ordered a couple of minutes after the 0pm deadline shown online , paid_extra for next_day delivery via_royal_mail special delivery but the items didn_'_t arrive until 0 days_later .
neutral	when i queried this with character . com i received an_email_saying their dispatch cutoff is 0pm - their delivery policy on their website states 0pm !?
neutral	will use again , just won_'_t trust the delivery policy on the site .
neutral	unfortunately the batteries sent did not work , and replacement batteries did not work also .
neutral	thought it may be our phone until we got some batteries from local market that work just fine .
neutral	have no_idea as to why .
neutral	was disappointed only received one item of the two i ordered , not even sure if reimbursed .
neutral	but , the one item was very nice .
neutral	i am a loyal french connection fan and have always enjoyed their fashion forward lines .
neutral	recently , i was a bit disappointed in the fabric quality on a recent website purchase .
neutral	i ordered 0 articles of clothing , and i was disappointed with two of the articles .
neutral	the fabric was quite thin , and the colors were not as vibrant as how the website depicted them .
neutral	this was a first for me - i have always thought that french connection quality was superior to other competitor brands .
neutral	i will_continue to shop french connection , but only in their bricks and mortar_stores !
neutral	i tried to reach the parts department unsuccessful would some one please call me i need to place another order need to speak to some one
neutral	the last two times i ordered a prescription product my vet sent the approval fax back and vetrxdirect did not acknowledge it .
neutral	i had to call the company and get the fax situation straightened_out .
neutral	this slowed delivery time of the product which my dog needs on a daily_basis .
neutral	delays are not an option .
neutral	prior to this there had not been a problem .
neutral	i was disappointed that the paperwhite narcissus that i ordered for a gift too so long to arrive ( which could easily have been due to the cold_weather in january ), but more disappointed that it failed to bloom .
neutral	however , the customer_service people were eager to send a replacement to my gift recipient , and while it isn_'_t a spring bulb , it is a lovely plant .
neutral	i don_'_t know whether the failure to bloom is an_issue with quality control or inferior bulbs or damage in shipping ; the bulbs sprouted and grew , but did not form viable blooms .
neutral	this seems like a problem with the bulb itself , or its forcing prior to being shipped .
neutral	haven_'_t found a job yet using your site .
neutral	don_'_t like the fact that what they ask for is so generalized and price they will play is so general / like five to ten_dollars an_hour .
neutral	and when it is higher it doesn_'_t tell you if that '_s per hour or per day .
neutral	some don_'_t even how many children that do have or the specific ages .
neutral	and if they think a nanny will watch 0 children for 0 - 00 $ an hr .
neutral	they are crazy !!
neutral	the other ones that want a baby sitter , tutor , house cleaner , cook and chauffeur and only want to pay 0 - 00 $ an_hour are really crazy !
neutral	paid the courier company for a saturday delivery at £_00 - courier delivered on wednesday and threw parcel over garden gate as we were out .
neutral	i then spent over 00_minutes on the phone to organize the refund - at over 00 p per_minute .
neutral	quite a money spinner for the courier !
neutral	i would use country_attire ltd again but only if they could assure me of a different courier .
neutral	there are a lot of issues with google .
neutral	i used them & then i get lots of unwanted interruption in searches .
neutral	would like this to stop & would like to be able to choose what i want to see on my screen .
neutral	we ordered 0 costumes .
neutral	i tried on my medusa costume and when my husband was zipping it up it was a little tight and then it ripped !
neutral	now , i have a party in 0 days have to figure_out a way to alter it .
neutral	not real happy !
neutral	it was a size l and i where a 00 in ladies so that should be fine .
neutral	need to reduce delivery charges
neutral	it '_s tough to review because i haven_'_t received all the cards yet .
neutral	i did , however , receive the virtual card .
neutral	it was quick and so easy .
neutral	my grandson was extremely happy with my purchase for him .
neutral	i '_ll let you know about the other two cards when i receive them .
neutral	they are expected in a few_days .
neutral	on the 0th of december i believe .
neutral	looking_forward to it .
neutral	good delivery , good website .. small sizes nothing actually fits !
neutral	well , i started to booking process and got to the payment option and it kept asking me for the same information to verify - after checking and rechecking i then tried to call the " help " number on the site - this is a non_- working number - again , i '_m human , thought maybe i ' d made a mistake and tried again ....
neutral	i then thought maybe since i didn_'_t register ...
neutral	so i backtracked and registered instead of trying to check out as a guest .
neutral	when i went into my e_- mail to confirm my registration i had a fraud_alert from my visa account , and of course dropped everything to call them : it seems trying to book on easytobook raised some red flags as their headquarters are in france ; i '_ll admit to being a little_slow here - i kept telling him that i wasn_'_t trying to book a room in paris - just a suite in maryland !!
neutral	luckily the capital one agent was very patient and professional for he didn_'_t laugh out loud !!!
neutral	even after he hipped me to the fact that the great advertised price that drew me into the site was actually in euros - not us dollars !!!
neutral	( duh ) after being totally shamed that i hadn_'_t caught that , i was too embarrassed to quit and completed the booking .
neutral	( and yes , this virginian has_been to the uk and totally understands pound vs dollar ... just didn_'_t catch the euro thing ) incidentally i checked with the hotel ; it was the same price as i would have paid if i ' d just called them directly !!
neutral	not a penny less , let_alone a euro !!
neutral	that '_s an_hour and a half of my life i won_'_t get back .... lol
neutral	so , first clarify the currency_exchange_rate , and next : if you have a phone_number for customer assistance - please make_sure it is working !!
neutral	!
neutral	happy trails !
neutral	!
neutral	i as disappointed in how long it took to actually deliver the gift_card .
neutral	i think that over a week is not acceptable .
neutral	as stated i love most of the pens , i have bought , they do justice to the prize winning hand writing , the nuns taught me with split nib , and the ubiquitous ink wells , that luckier girls had their plaits dipped in .
neutral	i have lamy pens with the wrong_size and colour .
neutral	i have fine pen , supposedly near universal refills , and way to many fine tipped , pens of every type , roller_ball , drawing_pens , roller gel .
neutral	no compatibility with refills and pens .
neutral	i write a lot , as a counsellor , using write extensive work notes before entering final copy on client data bas .
neutral	as post grad student am never without 0 - 0 of your pens in various colours , as sub topics of thesis notes and articles are written and filed by colour .
neutral	i have had a different pen turn up to the one i was sure i had ordered .
neutral	i did not recieve the correct amount of ' free lamy ' promotional pens , to correlate with the promotion requirements .
neutral	and most frustrating of all i have a number of small foil sachets with fine point pens refills and despite having many fine line pens , that get thrown_away .
neutral	i find the website a nightmare .
neutral	have not told any of my stationary ' nut ' about you foot that reason .
neutral	all would be forgiven if contact with sales staff was easier , and you you could tell me where i can buy some letter sized suspension files .
neutral	given a gorgeous american , piece of furniture / letter file , bit no sets pension files .
neutral	have not been able to locate anywhere .
neutral	file will nearly hold a0 suspension file , but not quite comfortably accommodates quatro / a0 manilla folders .
neutral	so that information and the name of the pen i have all the proudly acquired refills would make the service fabulous .
neutral	thanks
neutral	just think a bit more marketing and products for younger generations of makeup users would be helpful .
neutral	have always had the image of my grandma using these products .
neutral	seems like they ' re trying to do elderly posh .
neutral	i '_ve heard good things about the products just wouldn_'_t ever go buy them .
neutral	i ordered from other_sites on the same day - i received their packages , but a week_later received partsgeek .
neutral	i have been a customer of petflow . com since right after they launched .
neutral	the selection of food , toys and treats is outstanding .
neutral	delivery is prompt and the threshold for earning free_shipping is very reasonable .
neutral	customer_service is polite and satisfactory .
neutral	they are * so close * to earning a five - star_rating ... except for the website .
neutral	it ’_s awful .
neutral	there is no way to limit your searches to products you actually want - for instance , i buy nature ’_s variety dry_dog_food .
neutral	i can pull up nature ’_s variety products , but i have to scroll_through canned_cat_food , dry_cat_food , canned_dog_food .... looking for the items i want .
neutral	don_’ t even think about trying to put more specific product descriptions in the search_function ; you will get a wild mish - mash of completely unrelated products .
neutral	i also have more than one ‘ flow ’ or regularly_scheduled delivery .
neutral	i rotate the food my dogs eat with each order , so i have to go in and change the contents after each shipment .
neutral	once i have changed the dry_dog_food shipment , i must log out and log back in to change the canned_food shipment because even_though i have saved my changes and closed the dry_food ‘ flow ’, when i open the link for the canned_food ‘ flow ’, the dry_food order shows up and will not close unless i do the log out - log in dance .
neutral	they should be simple things to fix ( hire a programmer ?)
neutral	but month after month i ’_m forced to deal with these issues because petflow hasn ’ t .
neutral	come on , petflow ... just fix it already and get that five - star review !
neutral	flurry of emails - all very good .
neutral	product doesn_'_t keep flies off .
neutral	the service was fast and prompt .
neutral	however , the color i ordered was a purple and the lettering color when it came was pink .
neutral	no i did not contact them , but i was disappointed .
neutral	i loved the finished canvas and would recommend the company highly for this .
neutral	however , i was away for a week when it was delivered .
neutral	instead of posting a card through my door to arrange redelivery , the canvas was just left there .
neutral	luckily my neighbour took it in but this is most unsatisfactory and for this reason i will never use the company again sadly
neutral	i stayed at this hotel one week prior and the rate was $_000 . 00 / night .
neutral	reservations this week were going to cost me $_000 . 00 / night which is a ridiculous amount to pay for a hotel room .
neutral	i was very disappointed in the rate .
neutral	i travel a lot for business purposes and we have a budget we must stay within for hotels , which is much less_than $_000 . 00 / night .
neutral	although i really liked this hotel price will probably keep me from staying here again .
neutral	de plaatjes van_de behangvoorbeelden laden niet .
neutral	heel vervelend .
neutral	their good but not worth buying from if your doing small orders , because they charge way too much in shipping fee '_s !
neutral	i ordered a shirt size large when i received it around the rib cage the shirt was really tight we ' re the rest of the shirt was not it was not what the picture showed
neutral	can '_t rate your service - i haven_'_t received what was ordered ~ thanks
neutral	the slipper socks were the exact style i wanted and the right material - terry cloth .
neutral	i had had a pair like that and wore them for years .
neutral	that pair was a little heavier terry cloth - soft - clingy - stayed put and easy to put on and take off .
neutral	they were just the right weight for our california valley winter temps .
neutral	the pair sent me from easycomforts arrived quickly and the price was good - but there is where the comparison stops .
neutral	two holes appeared in one sock immediately upon slipping it on my foot - and the other sock has a tiny hole as well .
neutral	when i wear them the material stretches and allows the sides of my feet or my toes to slide past the composition sole .
neutral	the terry needs to be thicker to give a little more warmth and the elasticity needs to decrease some .
neutral	i was going to order one or two more pairs if they were satifactory - but they weren_'_t .
neutral	i would pay a higher price for better quality .
neutral	( i sewed up the holes to get a little more time out of them - but it won_'_t last ).
neutral	transportation was okay , a bit late on the pick_up and some_confusion on the way back .
neutral	as tour had a few german tourist , the tour_guide was german so all commentary were in german and english ... a bit long_winded so missing some of the sights while the translation is going on .
neutral	not too bad but i think the itinerary / time could be improved .
neutral	the customer_service was friendly and helpful .
neutral	we did receive our product a day later than they originally estimated .
neutral	other than that everything turned_out ok .
neutral	i may use them again .
neutral	your e_- gift_card designs are unattractive and limited .
neutral	you still have christmas designs up !
neutral	however , your customer_support has always been stellar .
neutral	it wasn_'_t until after i bought my tickets to see bruno mars that i saw how much bad_reviews viagogo a gotten .
neutral	i '_m really tatting to get worried and i was also curious to why they deliver so close to the event date .
neutral	petflow fills your inbox with too many emails .
neutral	if you really spend a few min . s too look on the site , you will find some decent deals , however , i was expecting more wholesale type of prices ... also i got billed on the 00th this mth , but as of today , the 00st , still no pet_food :/ so you have to gauge the days by at_least approx .
neutral	0 days out for shipping time , if your relying , on the food being there for your pet , and if your not relying_on it ?
neutral	it '_s still not seeming like there is that much of a perk here .. i may quit soon if i find better deals on my dogs ,' roll ', of food .. she '_s quite old & it '_s her special treat , besides the very occasional bits of real , beef or steak .
neutral	the products , buying process and delivery have been great , but searching for products on the website is pretty difficult .
neutral	needs some determination to find some more unusual spices / herbs .
neutral	this could definitely be improved .
neutral	glad to have received the part two_days sooner_than_expected but following the tracking status was a bit misleading .
neutral	took 0 days to receive part but the part matched perfectly
neutral	although i am really pleased with the speed , value and quality of my item i was really disappointed that my refund for the cancelled item was delayed for over 0_weeks with no_explanation .
neutral	i chased them twice but to no_avail .
neutral	only refunded once i raised a complaint with paypal so left me feeling less likely to use them again .
neutral	have used holiday autos on many occassions and they have always been really good , however this time they sub contracted to firefly which is located in the car_park ( not an easy trek with suitcases etc ) only to discover we had to take a number and we waited in it for over an_hour , really not good enough to have only two people to serve at_least two incoming flights .
neutral	the walking_tours were good and one of the bus_tour_guides was good , but the others were not .
neutral	our first guide talked really really fast and he just rambled on about random facts without delving into anything important .
neutral	for example , he hardly said anything about important spots in london but then prattled on in high speed about random unrelated facts .
neutral	the worst part of the experience was trying to find the bus_stops .
neutral	they were surprisingly difficult to find .
neutral	if you hopped_off and hopped back on at the same spot ( like at harrods ), you will be fine but if you walked anywhere and then tried to find the bus_stop , it was very very difficult .
neutral	ordering was easy .. and i '_ve ordered before and felt that it was a great experience .
neutral	i '_m a little frustrated not to have received my book after over 0_weeks
neutral	their products are not bad .
neutral	it '_s fair with the price
neutral	i received the ink in 0 days so was relieved that i could start again .
neutral	i also had to have someone show me how to remove the plastic covering because i couldn_'_t remove it
neutral	now i am using the black_ink only so_far .

neutral	i buy a chest of drawers and get a phone_call within hours to say that it can be delivered within a week if i pay lots more money .
neutral	but refusing to be conned in that way , i opt to wait weeks and weeks for delivery instead .
neutral	if the product is available and can be delivered quickly , why not deliver it quickly ?
neutral	it is poor after sale service in my opinion and very disappointing when the products are so good .
neutral	smarten up the delivery time , oak_furniture people .
neutral	incidentally , delivery guys were lovely white van men , polite and friendly .
neutral	i was contacted about 0 times to confirm delivery .
neutral	didn_'_t see our mat yet !
neutral	loved it online and have reasonable prices .
neutral	customer_service sucks .
neutral	it took_ages to sign_up , and the website asks for a lot of personal information , and even a driver '_s license and / or facebook confirmation ( i don_'_t put real info on facebook so i had to scan my dl in ).
neutral	it was lengthy , but secure .
neutral	the starting limit '_s pretty low ( after verification , i could only buy $_000 in one day and only about 000 monthly ?)
neutral	so i assume it '_ll eventually increase with more business .
neutral	onto the most annoying part .
neutral	i thought visa only called to make_sure the transaction was authorized for overseas websites but nooooo , visa called and woke me up at 0 am to have me verify the transaction was legit .
neutral	if this happens every_single time i decide to buy $_000 in gift_cards , i '_m just going back to walking down to 0 - 00 and buying the physical cards - because that is a wake - up call i don_'_t enjoy having .
neutral	all in all , okay , but super lengthy time .
neutral	required tons of personal information and resulted in visa giving me a wake_up call to make_sure that i actually did buy this .
neutral	ugh .
neutral	it took them forever to ship my product .
neutral	when i asked them why , i was told because it wasn_'_t in stock .
neutral	i would have liked to know that sooner .
neutral	but they did offer a small discount for it taking so long .
neutral	i ordered a few items a couple of mo . back 0 of them came in a timely_manner then i was notified that the other items where out of stock so after going back and fourth in the email i agreed to replace them after waiting for then to arrive 0_wks past i emailed rep . she said there where on the way ok waited 0 more wks again emailed rep . then i guess she got mad cause i said i wanted a refund cause they were taking to long so she said to me let_me explain it to u as usual and i hope u can understand it . so i again emailed her to let her know mot to talk to me like i don_'_t have an education she shouldn_'_t be talking to people that way then on top of it all i just received the items after waiting 0 plus mo .
neutral	for it i '_m going on vac 0 / 0 i wanted the order way before now so if it didn_'_t fit i could send it back etc .
neutral	but it '_s to late now thanks a lot
neutral	your orders are always short , most advertised items are on back order , company computer is outdated otherwise everything is okay
neutral	as nice as they were to deal with , the ink that i bought to use in my epson_printer did not work .
neutral	granted , it was not genuine epson_ink .
neutral	but i still thought if a company markets something for use that it would work .
neutral	now i have to replace the replacement and will end up buying ink twice to use it once .
neutral	i still_haven_'_t tried the hp_ink i purchased .
neutral	but i think i '_ll buy it '_s backup before i try it .
neutral	that one is for work and i can '_t leave it to get something that will work .
neutral	i need it to work when i need it .
neutral	thanks for trying , inkfarm .
neutral	i went to town_fair with an_appointment with my 0 year_old they took my car right_away but i still waited over 0 hours ( got 0 new_tires ) they didn_'_t have enough seats for everyone and offered no bathrooms
neutral	we were very happy with the peugeot 000 that we rented for a week in quimper .... at the train_station .
neutral	the only problem was the person at the desk said we did not have insurance on the car and had us sign another form which would cost 000_euros more !
neutral	when we asked auto_europe to check this , they responded_immediately saying that we did indeed have insurance .
neutral	they said to call the quimper office and tell them we had insurance .... and that we might have to return to quimper ( a 00 minute drive ) to settle the problem ..... luckily , the person answering the phone at avis said she would remove the charge and cancel the insurance .
neutral	we have not been charged , so_far , for the extra insurance .
neutral	i don_'_t think i will order from this company again .
neutral	the iron on name_tags don_'_t stick well .
neutral	they are peeling_off after one wash .
neutral	rates were good , but would have love to have known about the coupons on your web_site .
neutral	found a link about coupons at the bottom of the page ( small link ) after i placed our reservations .
neutral	i could have saved an_additional_$_00 . 00 off our reservations
neutral	i always get great service although sometimes it just seems like people there hate their jobs or simply do not enjoy being there .
neutral	after waiting the 0 days as stated in the website i contacted for a status_update only to be told that the waiting time is up to 0 days or more .
neutral	they just need to state this on the site ..... under promise and over deliver , not the other way round !
neutral	that way you will have people think ' what a great fast service ' rather_than ' bit_slow as they said it would be faster '.
neutral	i would have been happy to wait 0 + days if that was the timeline stated .
neutral	also , if you are going to be late , then an_email update giving the reason would be helpful , rather_than the customer having to chase for info .
neutral	glasses are great though , and great value for money , just need to tidy up your customer_service processes .
neutral	i purchased the scripto tech dual ballpoint stylus ( item #: 0000 - 00 ) from pinnacle_promotions .
neutral	i was really pleased with the customer_service at pinnacle_promotions , but i was disappointed how cheap our pens looked .
neutral	there are two seams on the barrel of the pen .
neutral	these seams were not visible in any of the preview pictures on the website .
neutral	our logo is directly above the seam so the seam is very obvious and it makes the pen appear very cheap and junky looking .
neutral	i will not bother to buy products from pinnacle_promotions in the future .
neutral	these are not quality promotional products that i am proud to pass out to potential_customers .
neutral	i have to say this website was very helpful ; filled with many , many hotels and hostels listed with great descriptions .
neutral	i really like how you can conveniently look at a map to see the location of the hotel and it '_s surroundings .
neutral	i did find reading the reviews ( both good and bad ) helpful in which hotel to chose .
neutral	however , when you see the " low_prices " listed on the page , i didn_'_t realize that it was a percentage of the grand_total of $_000 .
neutral	the total price is listed in a smaller don_'_t which was misleading at first .
neutral	i knew it was a too good to be true moment , but thankfully i saw the actual price before i purchased that hotel .
neutral	after learning this about the website , i did still find a good hotel and a price that was better for me !
neutral	it was alright but kinda far away from kamakura and a bit too pricey for what it was .
neutral	coffee is very weak .
neutral	also , i was charged a foreign_transaction fee , which i did not expect .
neutral	i like petflow for the most part , but i '_ve had my run - ins with their website - it leaves a little to be desired in the user_friendly department .
neutral	the only issue i had with my public_storage experience was that i left before my months rent was up and there was no money refunded to me .
neutral	first off let_me point out that i continue to use answer . co . uk and will shortly also be using it for my second business .
neutral	why ?
neutral	because of the 00 / 0 availability and low_cost .
neutral	if money were no object , i might think again .
neutral	some niggles - the website is clunky to use and really needs updating .
neutral	it '_s apparently very easy ( as i discovered ) to update your instructions in the wrong place .
neutral	looks right on the website , apparently doesn_'_t come up on the receptionist '_s screen .
neutral	not helpful .
neutral	in addition , you have to be very clear with your instructions - think giving instructions to a 0yo .
neutral	the receptionists don_'_t have a clue who your business is - understandably , given the amount of businesses they must answer calls for .
neutral	so you can have some very weird messages coming through !
neutral	but they do their best .
neutral	be clear in your own mind - do you want it to sound like a call_centre ?
neutral	do you want to sound like you have a whole sales_team just waiting in the middle of the night for them to put calls through but already overflowing with calls ?
neutral	" the lines are all busy at the moment , can i get someone to call you straight back ?"
neutral	isn_'_t ideal at 00pm when you ' re a one - man band !
neutral	takes a bit of work with them to get that to not happen and they could be more proactive and personal about their account management in that respect .
neutral	you can get a much more tailored , integrated service elsewhere - but at massively more cost and i haven_'_t found one that does 00 / 0 - the fact that answer . co . uk does 00 / 0 without offshoring to asia or charging a huge out - of - hours premium is a massive plus .
neutral	positives - they answer quickly and efficiently , the messages can come through on email and / or sms , you know someone '_s always going to answer your calls when you can '_t , the prepay option is really easy and very cost_effective .
neutral	would i recommend them ?
neutral	well yes , i '_m going to be using them again - but with the caveat that you must update with them regularly and give very accurate , clear_instructions .
neutral	call your number occasionally to see what your customers are experiencing and tweak accordingly .
neutral	and if you can get an account_manager to check over everything with you to make_sure everyone '_s on the same songsheet , even better .
neutral	overall though , excellent value for money , just a little hard work if you want to get them not to sound like a call_centre .
neutral	i like to use boiler_juice cos hopefully u get me the best price but this time fuel company messed me around on more than one occasion
neutral	i even spoke to the company to check when they were coming so i could be there and they still didn_'_t turn up .
neutral	also when i called them to find out what was happening they never called me back terrible customer_service but helpful driver once it did arrive .
neutral	as usual efficient service from boiler_juice but u might want to consider not using [_link ] too often , thanks .
neutral	i use to be able look at one to three_days plus or minus
neutral	around days i was looking at for best travel
neutral	rates .
neutral	now it '_s gone and when you talk to
neutral	customer_service they say depending_on
neutral	who you talk to it '_s still there or they removed
neutral	it for better customer_service
neutral	i love your shoes , and great prices , but i never get my email that its been shipped and my tracking_info , and its really fustrating .
neutral	information and rates were excellent ; however prepayment was a surprise .
neutral	unfortunately parcel_hero have twice delivered goods which on arrival were chipped or smashed however good customer_service received after the event .
neutral	they gave_me my order very quickly , but they were not selling authentic karma koins .
neutral	they were nx cards .
neutral	normally , this isn_'_t a big deal , but i was trying to put $ 0 on one account , and the rest on another .
neutral	it charged the entire card on that account , because only karma koins have the option to put however many points .
neutral	hello !
neutral	i have several animals , am super busy , and i hate to shop - your perfect customer .
neutral	but had i known the delivery would have taken a week , i would have looked elsewhere , or hit the stores .
neutral	but i am almost certain deliveries have been much_faster in the past .
neutral	perhaps i am thinking of a different delivery service .
neutral	could it be that it took so long because i purchased " extras " that i did not need .
neutral	is that so ?
neutral	it would be a good thing to know for next time so i could buy strategically .
neutral	thanks for asking
neutral	i have traded on ebay since it started .
neutral	at the beginning it was a much_better resource where people connected with one another to sell their stuff .
neutral	it was a great way to sell things that you no_longer needed ( or wanted ) or to find components you could not find locally .
neutral	things once sold at garage sales were suddenly available through ebay .
neutral	the prices were really decent .
neutral	there was a nice community of folks , too .
neutral	still is .
neutral	unfortunately ebay has evolved into a place where prices have gone way up and scalping is not unusual .
neutral	i have seen items selling for more than msrp ( sometimes double or even triple , depending_on how scarce the item is ).
neutral	usually it is something kids want with parents who do not know the value of teaching delayed gratification .
neutral	as in waiting until something is available at a reasonable price .
neutral	when a new video_game system is released , demand is usually much higher_than supply ; and , to some , no price is too high .
neutral	the same goes for some popular video games .
neutral	some will say this is a good thing .
neutral	i '_m not sure that greed is ever good .
neutral	when i say greed , i am not strictly speaking about sellers .
neutral	it is on the part of the buyers who must have something no_matter_how much they pay .
neutral	that was bound to happen .
neutral	ebay is no_longer the small community it once was .
neutral	it is still a darned good place to find things you cannot find anywhere_else .
neutral	vinyl albums ... older games , movies , etc .
neutral	that is what made ebay a good thing in the beginning and that has not changed .
neutral	just make_sure you know your prices .
neutral	and use paypal to protect yourself .
neutral	we bought the omega 0 test_kits .
neutral	our results were incredibly identical despite gender difference , nutrition differences , activity differences , supplement differences , historical background differences .
neutral	makes us think it is all bogus .
neutral	the first black_cartridge i used was half empty after just one day , with very little printing .
neutral	also , one of the color cartridges apparently leaked in the plastic container so i didn_'_t even open it .
neutral	i would like to return the color_cartridge in the unopened contained which had leaked but don_'_t know how to go about it ..
neutral	if you are from canada and want to use it to book in canada you get charged us funds because travelocity is a usa company .
neutral	which doesn_'_t make_sense .
neutral	the bouquet that was finally delivered to my dear_friend was very beautiful .
neutral	having 0 different delivery dates where the flowers were not delivered was frustrating , however my inquiries were always answered quickly and professionally , and finally the difficulty was solved .
neutral	i am glad they have a place to " track delivery " on their web_site or i would never have known there was a problem with the delivery , especially_since i do not live in the uk .
neutral	because of this delivery tracking ability i would probably use serenata again , i am sure this problem was highly unusual , although also highly frustrating .
neutral	i know there was a delay in the shipment because of weather , but i have still not received my food after a week when it was ordered .
neutral	i had to go buy more food to make it until my shipment arrived ( at a higher price , no less .)
neutral	i am a breeder , feed 0 rhodesian ridgebacks and having food is kind of critical .
neutral	i hope this is not the norm in the delivery from pet best .
neutral	prices are great , free_shipping ... hoping that after this initial shipment things will be more timely .
neutral	it would have been nice to recieve some_sort of notice that the shipment had been delayed so i could have planned more appropriately .
neutral	i '_ve referred this company to many of my puppy families so hoping we ' re going to get better service after this .
neutral	i found buyfencingdirect while desperately hunting for fence panels in a period of " national fencing shortage ".
neutral	the panels were reasonably_priced despite the national shortage and appear to be of good quality ( certainly much_better_than the oddments i had seen in large diy superstores ) and all match .
neutral	the delivery was a bit hit and miss .
neutral	having booked a day off work my delivery didn_'_t show up on the expected day due to a problem with the drivers , however the company did call relatively early on in the morning to explain this .
neutral	my delivery was then scheduled for the next_day , which wasn_'_t really convenient , but i was told since the van had been loaded it couldn_'_t be unloaded (!).
neutral	when the van arrived it turned_out only half my order was on it .
neutral	the driver was excellent , friendly and very helpful , he went beyond his call of duty and carried the fence panels into the garden , and got in touch with his boss to establish where the other half of my order might be .
neutral	he told me customer_services would be in touch within the hour .
neutral	a day later i rang customer_services to prompt them and they told me it was the first they ' d heard about the missing items .
neutral	a week_later the remaining items - landscape stakes - have arrived , again they appear to be good quality , were extremely well priced and were delivered by a ( different ) very courteous driver .
neutral	in a nutshell , the goods sold from buyfencingdirect seem to be worth the delivery hassle .
neutral	delivery unclear , and i received no status_updates on my order ( although i was emailed to say i would be notified when my package was shipped ).
neutral	the items are not anything like the images .
neutral	one item for instance , a dress , is two layers and still completely see through .
neutral	it has nothing to do with the style of the dress , rather it is simply low quality .
neutral	unimpressed with the products and service .
neutral	here goes friend !
neutral	i like the rugs i got !
neutral	i do not like they can not be put in dryer !
neutral	now the good part , i orders 0 rugs , large , medium and small .
neutral	i know i ordered one in the tan , or thought i had .
neutral	so have 0 maroons .
neutral	the medium one is not cut straight !
neutral	it is really off .
neutral	the other two are pretty good .
neutral	i would send them back , it is expensive so guess i will just keep them
neutral	whoever does the checking of the rugs , need fired !!!
neutral	!
neutral	sincerely a not happy customer ,
neutral	jo jordan
neutral	the shipping and selling part was easy , however once my books were received they were sold for a lot less_than i was quoted .
neutral	about 0 / 0 less !
neutral	by then it was too much_trouble to cancel my sell .
neutral	i just went along with it but can '_t help but feel_cheated .
neutral	next time i sell books i '_m going to look around .
neutral	it '_s probably my fault ?
neutral	i was able to place the order - paid and received a confirmaton .
neutral	then the day of delivery i was sent an_email_stating that it couldn_'_t be delivered that day as there was no florist available - i was disappointed as i would have probably tried another_vendor if i was told before ordering that it could not be delivered on saturday .
neutral	on the plus side - i was offered an upgrade to be delivered on the next business day or the opportunity to cancel .
neutral	i chose to upgrade .
neutral	i can '_t really follow_up with the recipient as they are sympathy flowers so it would be inappropriate - so i just have to assume that all is well .
neutral	this hotel is close to jfk and this was a plus for me .
neutral	the room was clean but service was poor .
neutral	the only breakfast item available was coffee .
neutral	i was a little disappointed !
neutral	with regards to dog_food orders i have been very pleased .
neutral	however petflow advertised a special on mountain tee_shirts .
neutral	i ordered 0 : one golden ret .
neutral	sz small and one stripe cat face sz small .
neutral	the order was accepted and several days_later i received a whoops we were just getting ready to send and found out we don_'_t have it .
neutral	i called and was told pf had the cat tee but not the golden_retriever .
neutral	so i called back and asked to make an addition to my order .
neutral	i was told now they had the golden ret .
neutral	but not the cat tee .
neutral	how did that happen ?
neutral	weren_'_t they holding what they had of my order ????
neutral	i was told they would send everything but the cat tee and that was due in anyday .
neutral	the next_day i received and email_stating it was in and on it '_s way to me .
neutral	two_days after that i received another " whoops we were just getting ready to send and found out we don_'_t have it .
neutral	what on earth is going on ?????
neutral	not happy needless to say .
neutral	either way .... i have not received anything so i don_'_t even know if the first part of the order was sent as_promised .
neutral	the service was stress_free for us and helpful as travelling with a small baby .
neutral	the only down_side was not being_able to get through to the mobile number given .
neutral	they should have more than one number
neutral	i sent a thank_you gift to my aunt and uncle from the states and i wanted to ensure they received it .
neutral	therefore , when asked about delivery options i chose knock on the door .
neutral	the gift was left_outside the gate although they said it was a secure area .
neutral	so as of now i am still unsure if my gift was received .
neutral	i '_ve order a few different things from inkgarden .
neutral	while i love their options and the ease of which you can create projects , i '_ve noticed a difference in color quality when i receive my purchases .
neutral	my last purchase was included three different mugs .
neutral	two of them had bluish undertones and the third seemed like the picture had bee lightened a bit .
neutral	the quality of the products is great , but the color seems inconsistent compared to my original photos .
neutral	i was to get a gift_card , instead i received a store credit_card !
neutral	when we had to change our return booking we knew it would be £_00 but in the end it cost us £_00 and when i asked what .
neutral	the difference was i was told it was because the ferry company had put up their prices .
neutral	saffron_rouge has really great products , ( although somewhat limited ).
neutral	however they can be penny wise and pound foolish .
neutral	for instance they advertised a big sale on vapour makeup ( a brand i love ).
neutral	when i put the product in my cart the discount didn_'_t show but i thought " ok it must be one of those things where the discount goes through when you check out ."
neutral	unfortunately that was not the case , so i contacted customer_service when my card was charged the full_amount , and it turned_out that only 0 shades were on sale , and the other shades were full price .
neutral	i felt this was deceptive , and they eventually gave_me a discount , but with a very grudging attitude .
neutral	it '_s a pity because i '_ve been a customer for years and have spent way more money than i want to admit with them .
neutral	it shouldn_'_t have been like pulling_teeth to get a discount especially when it was their promotion that led to the misunderstanding .
neutral	the end_result -- i prefer to buy my products on other_sites .
neutral	sad .
neutral	takes for ver to get refund and not only once .
neutral	right at this moment i haven_'_t got my refund for over 0_weeks not a good service :(
neutral	i '_m waiting to see if i get the correct_part and a rma in a timely_fashion .
neutral	i was pleased that the parcel came in good time , infact i was really impressed at the speedy_delivery , however , the box that the shoes were contained in was really worn and torn .
neutral	that was a great shame as it was meant to be a gift for someone .
neutral	i ended_up keeping one of the items and sending the footwear back which wasn_'_t made particularly easy as i had to cut out and stick plain paper over my address replacing it with a handwritten returns address .
neutral	no real problem with that but in this day and age returning goods should be made as convenient as possible for the consumer , right down to the company providing a sticky back returns slip .
neutral	it was nice to have a heavy_bag of dog_food delivered right to my door .
neutral	it was so convenient .
neutral	the draw_back was that i paid the same price i pay at the store for a larger bag , so ultimately , i paid for the luxury of not going to the store .
neutral	if i was home bound , i would definitely continue using this service , but since i '_m not , i '_ll continue to do my own shopping , since i try to use my money and time wisely .
neutral	i booked a ticket but enter a wrong return date .
neutral	now i would like to change that asap .
neutral	i just sent out the email ( this is the only way to contact you !!
neutral	), and after 00_hours , i got my reply .
neutral	i replied immediately for further request , no one reply to my request !
neutral	!
neutral	i have replied several emails now but got no reply !
neutral	!
neutral	so could the customer_service be a little quicker ?!??
neutral	your work load is that heavy ?!!
neutral	?
neutral	i have waited 00_hours now and i need to change the return date of my ticket asap !
neutral	!
neutral	will you reply my email then i have to wait 00 - 00_hours again ?!
neutral	could you be more efficiently ?
neutral	!
neutral	even i tried your online_chat but it is never online !
neutral	!
neutral	the room was comfortable and the staff pleasant .
neutral	however ... we were there for 0 nights , and after the first night , no one came to clean the room , make the beds , or change the towels .
neutral	possibly we returned to the room before the cleaning staff arrived , but to my knowledge no one asked if they could come and clean , or when would be a good time to come_back .
neutral	i had gone down to the pool area to relax , and there were a bunch of unsupervised teenagers running up and down the multilevel staircases , jumping over the gates , and being both disruptive and unsafe .
neutral	no hotel staff were anywhere_near to intervene .
neutral	trying to sleep at night was impossible .
neutral	several families across the hall had loud parties , crying children , and screaming adults well after midnight .
neutral	we seriously thought of leaving but at that hour weren_'_t sure where else to go .
neutral	i was exceptionally disappointed , especially_considering the reputation most marriott hotels have .
neutral	again , if i could get a reservation elsewhere i definitely would .
neutral	seriously , great job guys .
neutral	i was pleased that everything i ordered arrived only a few_days after i checked out ... however , i was really displeased that i got double_charged initially for the books because my address was not updated when i tried checking out for the first time .
neutral	that is something that should not have happened at all and it really ruined my day because i didn_'_t know that i was $_00 dollars down .
neutral	if i hadn_'_t caught the problem on time i could have been charged a lot of bank fees .
neutral	they tried , but the mattress needed replacing ( really sunken down on one side ), and the cold_water taps in the showers in both of our rooms were frozen shut .
neutral	my 00 - year - old_son finally got our tap free , but he was afraid that he was going to break the pipe in the process ( he '_s a weight - lifter ).
neutral	when i called the desk , they offered to have us shower in another room , but it was not worth the inconvenience since it was on a different floor and we needed to get going .
neutral	the man on duty was very apologetic and told me that their water is incredibly hard and causes lots of problems , so i understood what happened .
neutral	since i have really nasty hard water at home , i can sympathize , but it seems like the housekeeping_staff could turn the taps in unoccupied rooms and keep on top of problems to keep this from happening .
neutral	i wish you didn_'_t screw the delivery_men and restaurants when you take your cut .
neutral	i wish restaurants actually paid attention to the ' send no utensils / napkins / etc ' thing .
neutral	good price , but the delivery instructions are never acted on , so is there any point in writing them ?
neutral	not just a one - off - same problem with every order .
neutral	still - good value and i will_continue to use boiler_juice , but it '_s only chance that the order gets put in the correct tank .
neutral	identity_guard is pretty good - but i wonder_how accurate the results are ?
neutral	but , i would say to get it because they do give accurate alerts .
neutral	i have bought many items from oakfurnitureland which have mainly been very good .
neutral	the salesmen have been very pleasant and helpful as have the delivery_men .
neutral	the customer_service has not been good at all .
neutral	on one occasion i was told that i could not just have a replacement chest of drawers in place of a damaged one , but that they would repair the damaged one .
neutral	i was also told that if imreturned it and tried to order another one the same i would be refused by the online team and also that " what did i expect for the price i had paid ".
neutral	not what i expected from customer serrvice .
neutral	i have just been refused another exchange for a drawer with a lopsided handle .
neutral	i must send a photo and a photo of the label on the back of the chest o drawers , which i cannot get to as we had to remove some skirting board to get the drawers in with the help of a friend to lift it in , and my husband and i are unable to lift them .
neutral	after_spending over_£ 0 , 000 with the company i would really like better service when they get it wrong .
neutral	you can '_t go wrong with the clubmasters .
neutral	they are perfectly stylized , crystal - clear , and true quality .
neutral	however , my first order was lost , and the process to receive my glasses ended_up taking two months !
neutral	i am very satisfied with the glasses , but i would have trouble ordering again and trusting that my order would be received .
neutral	otherwise , beautiful glasses and worth the price .
neutral	the photo is cropped too close to the top -- doesn_'_t look good in a frame -- not like it was on the proof -- very disappointing !
neutral	business cards were great .
neutral	but i ordered ' postcards ' and supplied design for the front .
neutral	thinking form the website pics that it was standard postcard graphics on the back and nothing for me to do for that .
neutral	no comment made by the shop .
neutral	but they came back as printed only on one side , effectively a0 cardboard flyers , looking a bit odd .
neutral	feel it should have been picked_up on , and the postcard should be supplied as a postcard , otherwise i would have gone for a flyer .
neutral	initial contact was haphazard by e_mail but i think that was due to summer holidays from staff .
neutral	website works well .
neutral	ihan kohtuulliset valikoimat ja edulliset hinnat verrattuna monn muihin sivuihin .
neutral	toimitus tuli 0 päivää tilauksesta .
neutral	hieman epäselvät sivut kun osa englanniksi ja osa suomeksi .
neutral	rahan lähteminen tililtä kesti todella kauan ja näin ollen epäilin ettei paketti koskaan edes saavu , mutta tuli se sieltä lopulta .
neutral	:) aion tilata uudelleen kun ymmärsin tämän maksusysteeminkin viimein !
neutral	the car we rented was great .
neutral	it was a ford_fiesta .
neutral	driving back to london , we stopped at the last
neutral	service station on the m0 before we dropped the car off at avis .
neutral	we looked for another chance to top up the car but couldn_'_t find one .
neutral	after driving 00_miles on a very full_tank to get back to the drop_off point , avis charged us 00 . 00_pounds for not having a full_tank .
neutral	i think this was totally unreasonable and just put a huge blemish on a really good experience .
neutral	the product arrived and was exactly_what i expected .
neutral	the downside was that order processing took over 0_weeks and then it finally shipped .
neutral	their prices were the same or slightly_higher_than those in my local_pet_store .
neutral	add shipping onto that and i end up paying more .
neutral	i have no plan to work with them again , unless some really good deal comes into play .
neutral	otherwise the experience was fine , shipping was quick .
neutral	the 00 cans of dog_food were packed on the bottom of the box , shrink wrapped together in a smaller carton .
neutral	the three five pound_bags of dry_dog_food were on top of the cans .
neutral	there was dry_food spilled throughout the carton since the three bags were torn .
neutral	now i '_ll have to tape up the two bags that won_'_t be needed for awhile so the food stays fresh .
neutral	ordered wrong product .
neutral	tried to call and was on hold for over a half_hour .
neutral	you need more help to assist new customers .
neutral	i am returning the wrong product and want the correct product .
neutral	ordered left power mirror 00000 00000000 and the support_ticket is 000000 .
neutral	i checked online again and found the correct one that is the left side driver power remote mirror 00000 00000000 .
neutral	all i want is to exchange the mirror .
neutral	i am not happy with waiting on the phone to get help from you .
neutral	i hope i get the right mirror on exchange .
neutral	when you put an order on line , surely they should let you know if the item is in stock or not .
neutral	i was hoping to complete a couple of projects over the easter_weekend , but as i only received clock hands and not the movements , this could not happen .
neutral	disappointed or what
neutral	i called a few different times just because i needed a walk through on the website with a couple different things and they were trying to charge me a manual fee !
neutral	for helping_me ?
neutral	i just though that was weird ...
neutral	but other than that everything is great ...
neutral	i '_m not overly impressed .
neutral	i ordered a beatles gift pen set which included the pen box for $_00 . 00 .
neutral	i received three beatles pens in a zip lock bag that sells for $ 0 . 00 .
neutral	i called and was told they would send me the correct item .
neutral	i '_m waiting .
neutral	i paid about $_00 for a hotel room ( online it was shown as $_00 + taxes ) i was given a bill at the hotel showing the actual charge to travelocity '_s card , which was $_00 .
neutral	i expected a service fee : a markup of $_00 for the booking seems too steep .
neutral	i '_ll call the hotel next time .
neutral	i just don_'_t get excellent service .
neutral	the phones are good , but other than the mytouch slide , they ' re just average phones .
neutral	i only get 0g for about 0 mins at a time , and then it disappears for like 00_mins and then comes back .
neutral	i tend to shy away from this site because of your extreme shipping prices , only ordering when i absolutely have to to get the shoes i need , which are usually on clearance , so i can make up for the shipping .
neutral	please lower your shipping so i can order more often !
neutral	please !
neutral	i do love your shoes .
neutral	so much extra fabric looks hand made not frm a actual store . no tags cricket hemline just not wat i expected
neutral	i mistakenly ordered food for my dog (# 000000 ) on november 0th and then realized the last time i ordered i set it up for automatic delivery .
neutral	i immediately contacted petflow and " talked " with danny .
neutral	i was told to just cancel the order i had just placed and it would ship out on the 00th (# 000000 - the originally scheduled automatic date ).
neutral	i did that and guess what , i got the order placed november 0th ...
neutral	i then went in and cancelled all of my automatic_shipments and had to contact petflow again , this time " talking " to tracey to ensure that i wasn_'_t going to get another bag of food .
neutral	at that time , she told me that everything had been cancelled .
neutral	luckily i was able to catch the fact that the mistaken order was still being shipped ... hopefully this will never happen again ( my mistakenly ordering food when i have it set for automatic_shipment ), but what should i have done differently ?
neutral	most reviews state same thing .
neutral	can '_t speak to a real_person .
neutral	so i pressed 0 , for a new order and guess what ?
neutral	an actual real_person ...
neutral	i was disappointed that the antlers split so easily .
neutral	my puppy swallowed too much and was ill until she had loose stools and threw up several_times .
neutral	when the shards came out she settled down .
neutral	if information is shown as free cancellation - and you faced that it '_s not free and hotel will change you the whole stay !!!
neutral	you would be very frustrated !
neutral	it had a king_size bed for close to $_00 a night , plus tv and all the nice little sample - size trinkets .
neutral	plus it had a window and some hotels don_'_t have windows .
neutral	the only bad thing is that it had no complimentary_breakfast , the pool was closed for the season , and the outside wasn_'_t that pleasing to the eye .
neutral	but to come to rest after a long day of sight seeing , it wasn_'_t that bad .
neutral	had been told that delivery would be two working days but it wasn_'_t .
neutral	so i rang rubbersole up to be told there had been a delay .
neutral	anyway , they arrived safe and sound yesterday while i was in london
neutral	i love all the clothes here on yesstyle . com .
neutral	whatever style i '_m looking for is on this website .
neutral	however , the sizing options are so limited that i rarely buy anything because i know the thing i '_m looking for won_'_t fit .
neutral	delivery . com needs a few things to get where it needs to be .
neutral	first , the ui is ugly and at times nonfunctional .
neutral	it needs to be more fluid .
neutral	second , more restaurants need to participate .
neutral	seamless has many more than delivery . com .
neutral	i do enjoy to $ 0 coupons they give out from time to time .
neutral	have placed at_least 00 orders with this company over the last 0 months , delivery can vary from 0 days to 0_weeks , out of stock items are not highligted on ordering , i have apid for cat wormer presuming they are in stock only to be told 0 days_later they are out of stock , no good when you have kittens that need worming .
neutral	also had items never turn up waited a week for them to arrive but to no_avail only turned_up when i contacted the company by phone .
neutral	good prices but service and delivery could vastly be improved if i treated my pet shop customers this way they would not come_back to my shop .
neutral	i was expecting a free hairbrush which did not come with my order !!
neutral	not overly impressed i have to say !
neutral	!
neutral	my package had two products that had opened in transport .
neutral	my cat_litter was opened and spilled into box .
neutral	the pack of dog_treats bones was opened and in the box .
neutral	delivery is very good but i took delivery of a t0000 a couple days ago and it keeps showing as nearly empty and as the epsom is not the easiest of printers to reload cartridges this is very inconvenient .
neutral	delivery . com is a great site and i order from the site frequently .
neutral	discounts on food are frequent and the payment / delivery system is overall efficient .
neutral	however , the ratings on certain food venues are not as reliable , and have room for improvement .
neutral	there are some glitches on menus of certain places that could also use attention .
neutral	other than that , delivery . com ensure fast , decent food when i need it .
neutral	i was very happy with price and service but there was no card with the flowers which ruined the whole point of sending flowers .
neutral	a bit of a shame
neutral	it was nice to order some flowers from the united_states and have them delivered to the u . k . to my husband ’_s nan for her 00th_birthday .
neutral	i searched several sites to find a good deal and found teleflorist . com they seem to have a nice bouquet for a really good deal .
neutral	i ordered them with no_hassle , ask for them to be delivered in the morning and they were as requested , but the unfortunate thing is the flowers didn ’ t look anything like the ones advertised online .
neutral	they almost made me feel embarrassed to even have sent them to her .
neutral	lesson_learned i guess ‘ you get what you pay for ’!
neutral	site is ok although not as clean as before , assistance in office is great , very personable .
neutral	but why does public_storage continually try to raise my rent when i pay by automatic payment over many , many years without_fail , without being late , without hassles .?
neutral	it is so very annoying to have to call to readjust my rent all the time -- why ?
neutral	i have had a space since 0000 , and have down sized , and may find another place altogether because of this .
neutral	items arrived quickly but one box was faulty .
neutral	the vision was blurred and was fine with my old lenses .
neutral	i spoke with a customer_service representative who seemed helpful but it took further call to arrange replacement .
neutral	i understand that manufacturer problems occur but be aware normally with lens_store you would be expected to send back the lenses , they then get then analysed and then send you replacements .
neutral	not sure what you are supposed to do without in meantime .
neutral	my problem was / is being sorted but only because of insistence .
neutral	i love this site !
neutral	the only problem is before they use to have $ 0 . 00 shipping on orders $_00 or less and now they '_ve changed it .
neutral	so i have to wait for an awesome deal to place an order since i '_m on a budget and i don_'_t like paying so much shipping .
neutral	other than that this site is wonderful and a life_saver !
neutral	picked_up a new merc from venice airport , no manual on how to operate the car , even that the car engine cuts out when stopped in traffic or lights .
neutral	makes it very hard to use all the features of the car , becomes trial and eroor and time_consuming process
neutral	now that i have spent $ 0 , 000 dlls .
neutral	with bookit , i can not get any information on the tour or hotels , i have booked with them ?
neutral	like where to get picked_up , address of hotels ??
neutral	?
neutral	checked the site but from one night to next the price and available rooms varied greatly .
neutral	should have booked right_away instead of waiting to find a better price .
neutral	i ordered two beach towels from simply_beach .
neutral	they were both faulty , the stitching on the simply_beach logo was unravelling on both towels .
neutral	i spoke to customer_services and they advised me to send them back which i did .
neutral	i was refunded for only one towel and have been told that i will have to wait_until they have done a stock check before i am refunded for the second towel .
neutral	i think this is poor service .
neutral	apart_from this i have been very pleased with this company .
neutral	one of the planes was cleaner than the other .
neutral	everything was sold out like wine etc at the outbound flight from stockholm , not good
neutral	i paid_extra to get it in 0 days . but it did not come in on the 0nt day . was to come in on tues and did not get it till wed im not happy to have paid for to day shipping and it took 0
neutral	i '_m still_waiting on parts that i ordered
neutral	don_'_t know if it was the plant ( which looked healthy when it arrived ) or the transplanting , but it promptly died .
neutral	it was quite pricey ( went to 00_% the day after i ordered ), so i would be reluctant to try again .
neutral	i have used travelocity many_times .
neutral	always had a good experience .
neutral	however , with my last trip , i flew with jetblue .
neutral	my morning flight home was canceled due to a crew member being sick .
neutral	jetblue had no contingency plan so the flight was canceled .
neutral	not another one until the next_day .
neutral	they would not put me on a flight with a different airline even_though flights were available .
neutral	they didn_'_t offer me vouchers or pay for my extra expenses staying one more night .
neutral	when i called travelocity to get help getting on another flight , they could not help me .
neutral	i called three_times .
neutral	all three_times i could not understand the customer_service rep . two times i was kicked off the phone_call due to system problems and had to call back .
neutral	very frustrating travel experience !
neutral	will never fly jetblue again .
neutral	love the variety available but a bit disappointed that i have not received confirmation of actual delivery ... i will mail myself next time ...
neutral	waited in all day and it didn_'_t arrive .
neutral	still heard_nothing two_days_later .
neutral	had to ring pine_solutions and they gave a £_00 . 00 refund for the problems we had received .
neutral	not too impressed ..... our first order .... and the drawers are not flush on the unit .....
neutral	sloooooooooooooooow shipping !!!
neutral	it was like waiting for the pony_express !
neutral	fedex is awful !!!
neutral	ordered on oct 0th and didn_'_t get it until oct 00th .
neutral	this is not normal for petflow . com to take this long in getting my purchase to me .
neutral	typically i am very pleased w_/ petflow and i receive my order within 0 business days .
neutral	i placed my order on friday_morning , may 00 and today is tuesday , may 00 and i still don_'_t have my product .
neutral	my cats are getting extremely low on food !
neutral	fedex shipping is the worst way to send it !
neutral	parts are a decent price .
neutral	however i was in one state where i needed my car part sent to and you would not ship to me here .
neutral	i called and was on hold for 00_minutes before i hung_up without ever speaking to a csr .
neutral	i then ordered the part with a different card and it went through .
neutral	i sent numerous_emails to cancel the first order with the explanation , still no response .
neutral	i am assuming and need to check that the first one did not go through as i received a email_saying it was on hold .
neutral	i ordered a " skid plate " for my car , as mine had fallen_off on the interstate .
neutral	i took it to the oil change folks , who typically have to take it off to change the oil .
neutral	they said it didn_'_t have the connectors ( bolts ?
neutral	fasteners ?
neutral	whatever ?)
neutral	to attach it and therefore they couldn_'_t put it on .
neutral	i had a several email exchange with partsgeek , with many days between each , with the upshot being that partsgeek didn_'_t feel it was necessary to provide the parts to attach the plate .
neutral	not helpful at all with customer_service ... i am not happy with my experience .
neutral	i received the books in a timely_manner but the used books were in horrible condition .
neutral	last_year i ordered double bloom roses , meyer lemon_tree and a lime tree .
neutral	while the roses were supposed to be the same size , two came much smaller and one had to be replaced this year .
neutral	the lime tree produced many limes during the summer but died inside during the winter , cause unkown .
neutral	the lemon_tree is doing well .
neutral	this year i ordered lavendar which arrived completely out of their pots and grey - they were all dead .
neutral	i ordered one bouganvilla which arrived not in a pot but wrapped in " wet " paper towel that was dry by the time it arrived .
neutral	plant was dead .
neutral	i called brighter_blooms and they replaced it however new plant arrived in same condition as prior .
neutral	i didn_'_t call to complain but bought one from a local_nursery that is doing fine .
neutral	unfortunately , i won_'_t be ordering a plants from this company in the future .
neutral	petflow has good pricing but shipping and customer_service needs improvement .
neutral	i bought some small items to check out shipping before purchasing dog_food .
neutral	i live in las_vegas and thought that my order would ship directly from the las_vegas warehouse to my house .
neutral	however the order shipped to az first then back to las_vegas .
neutral	when i contacted cs regarding the issue , i was advised this is how it is done and the agent referred me to the 0 - 0 day delivery schedule .
neutral	not only was i disappointed in how my order was handled by way of shipping , the agent seemed to not care too much about my complaint .
neutral	petflow needs to state on their site how shipping works and let the customer decide if they want to place orders with this shipping method .
neutral	not take our money , then report how it will be sent .
neutral	i have been in dogs for over 00 years .
neutral	i run a dog rescue and train dogs .
neutral	i look for good prices and good customer_service .
neutral	as long as i know in advance how my items will ship , i can then plan orders and delivery times to meet the needs of my dogs and the needs of my customer '_s dogs .
neutral	petflow needs to improve before i will be placing another order or refer them to anyone_else .
neutral	sincerely ,
neutral	barbara h
neutral	code of honor working dog rescue
neutral	i was pleased that the colors were true to what was presented on the site .
neutral	however , my magnets are misshapen ; they are not rectangular .
neutral	also , the text that i had aligned on the computer was not aligned on the actual magnet .
neutral	once my order was shipped , it took an_additional 0 days to arrive .
neutral	i will be taking my business elsewhere next time .
neutral	things i loved :
neutral	poncho , map & headphone give - aways
neutral	the route and choices of route
neutral	things i wished for :
neutral	some info on any potential delays - e . g .
neutral	roadworks .
neutral	this would have helped_us . we would have known quickly that we would not get to buckingham_palace in time for changing of the guard due to road works and made an_alternative route .
neutral	i had a schedule that would have meant we would have got there in plenty of time but for road works .
neutral	there should be an obvious sign on the bus if that one is carrying a tour_guide ( or at_least the driver should have notified us ).
neutral	we preferred the buses with tour_guides as_opposed to the headphone guide which lacked personality and was temperamental .
neutral	all - in - all i do not feel i got value for money .
neutral	i like this website and was super happy i could just rent my textbook and send it back .
neutral	i was a little shocked when it came and it was a " loose_leaf " edition .
neutral	i have never had a book in loose_leaf format , but it was what i needed so i didn_'_t think it was a big deal .
neutral	what got me bent outta shape was that the print color was so light on a lot of my pages that i could_barely ready it without straining my eyes .
neutral	i have to be in super bright light to read this book , this aggravates me and i think it stinks .
neutral	my course is only 0 more weeks so by the time i send it back and get a new the class will be over .
neutral	i am not even bothering with it .
neutral	i used the system to send airtime and was very excited how convenient that was .
neutral	later tried to send money but couldn_'_t , no option for money transfer from us to kenya .
neutral	am i the only one who is not getting it ?
neutral	very pleased with my purchase but unfortunately i will not be purchasing again .
neutral	sorry to say but the cost of your postage and packing makes the item expensive .
neutral	i still_haven_'_t received my order and i '_m almost out of blanche '_s pills .
neutral	not sure why it would take so long .
neutral	i usually get delivery of on - line orders within 0 days tops .
neutral	i ordered 00 plain cow_ears and received 0 bags of 00 - white dried cow_ears that my dog enjoyed each and every day !
neutral	i place a second order but was very disappointed ... upon_receipt of 0 bags of 00 each - the total white dried cow_ears in the first bag was 0 .
neutral	the rest of the cow_ears are brown and greasy and my dog hates them .
neutral	i will not order from petflow again - i '_ll pay the higher price in the stores to get what i ask for .
neutral	it '_s great to be able to personalize a card , but why does it cost over $ 0 to send just a basic card ?
neutral	wish you can extend discounts to long - time customers : customer_service rep are not very friendly at that suggestion
neutral	placed my order on line last wednesday , then called to make_sure i could get the food for delivered by friday .... was told it would be delivered on friday when i arrived in atlanta .
neutral	received it on saturday ( two meals too late ) ..... not good since my dog is usually on a raw diet ( hard to travel with raw meat long_distances so tried this food when traveling with him to nc ).
neutral	thought i would try it again but ran_out of time so asked to have it at my destination by friday .
neutral	oh well .
neutral	lyn
neutral	just placed my first order .
neutral	so will rate when order received .
neutral	ordering was easy
neutral	i feel that it is a good website overall but it is very hard to find exactly_what you want .
neutral	my item is now on back order .
neutral	i will not get it for another month !
neutral	it is a very unorganized site but over all it had the cheapest prices for what i was looking for
neutral	i am_disabled and decided it would be much_easier to buy my pet_supplies ( 0 cats ) through delivery by pet_flow .
neutral	last_week , the delivery man delivered four boxes and dumped them in my foyer .
neutral	when i opened the boxes , two of the boxes of litter had torn_open on all four corners and litter flowed all over the foyer tile and living_room carpet .
neutral	i had to run to the garage ( and i certainly don_'_t run well ) and grab litter_boxes to try to contain the mess .
neutral	meanwhile the cats were sniffing around and i was afraid they would eliminate or defecate on the litter .
neutral	i then had to sweep up what i could to keep the cats away and hire someone to come the next_day to thoroughly vacuum .
neutral	i don_'_t want anything -- you asked for my opinion and you now have it .
neutral	believe me , it would have been easier to bring the litter home on the bus which my residence provides weekly for shopping .
neutral	in all fairness prior to this time i had a positive_experience with pet_flow and was glad to have found them .
neutral	when i am paying for 0 day shipping i expect that my order will go out the next_day , not 0 - 0 days_later and then 0 day shipping .
neutral	i '_ve used other_sites and there 0 day shipping is truly 0 days .
neutral	charged 0 / book to be shipped out and they were small books and came in the same package , could understand if they were two different packages , but 00 / for one package was a little excessive .
neutral	in they end they worked with me on the shipping issues and made good with me which i appreciated .
neutral	i was told i can '_t order through the contact in watford because he isn_'_t linked up to the web offers or something , so ended_up having to pay for postage when i usually pick it up myself , which is quicker also .
neutral	otherwise all very good and punctual and good service .
neutral	thanks
neutral	great experience buying products but the ' no_hassle return_policy ' hasn_'_t turned_out to be that way .
neutral	i am still_waiting to hear back from someone about trying to return two products i used that said " unconditionally guaranteed ' on the box .
neutral	because they didn_'_t work for me , i want to return them but was told i ' d have to wait to get a call back with their decision .
neutral	been two_days , called twice .
neutral	blah , blah ...
neutral	i ordered two t - shirts for my husband .
neutral	one was a boston_terrier shirt , and the other was supposed to be a french_bulldog t - shirt , but was actually a picture of a pug , not a french_bulldog .
neutral	the shirt even had frenchy embossed on the front of the shirt .
neutral	the hotel was just fine , and the staff was helpful .
neutral	however , they asked me for a credit_card to put on file ( as always ), then accidentally charged me for the room the next_morning , even_though i had purchased the room through_travelocity .
neutral	that is when i found out that i could have gotten the room for $_00 cheaper had i simply called the hotel .
neutral	it was quite a disappointment .
neutral	it caused me to just make reservations directly with the hotels for the remainder of my trip .
neutral	i did check prices on travelocity for these hotels beforehand , and the pricing was about the same .
neutral	i always thought that i was getting a better deal through_travelocity , but i have learned differently through this experience .
neutral	the pass was not received before my departure , thus i needed to arrange for self collection , but the collection_point was difficult to find and very inconvenient .
neutral	the pass does not cover the journey from airport to other stops in paris which is something may not be known by the buyer .
neutral	will not recommend paris pass to my friends and relatives
neutral	its good , but to much .
neutral	some flowers didn_'_t arrive in the best condition .
neutral	i was very surprised that my parcel came from sweden especially as it cost over 0 pounds to return shoes too big .
neutral	i was not given a return_label so was somewhat disappointed .
neutral	thgis should have been made clear when ordering
neutral	some of the big_bus workers were abrupt and did not feel that they should answer the questions you asked .
neutral	the vouchers were not immediatley given , you had to ask for them and then signposted to a hut to obtain them .
neutral	at no point did anyone inform you that these were available for you on the trip .
neutral	i did not feel that the bus transported you to the venues to enable you to make use of the vouchers .
neutral	i am not unhappy with the service or product but to pay considerable postage only to have the item damaged because it had not been put in packaging correctly would make me think_twice about buying online from this company again .
neutral	the drop_off was good although had to wait some 00 - 00_minutes but no problem as arrived early and although parked on yellow lines no one was around to move me on .
neutral	the collection was very frustrating as i could not make contact on the phone details provided which resulted in a a 00 minute delay and approx 0 phone_calls later having been directed by their telephonic system to gatwick and heathrow and through my perserverance eventually_managed to obtain a local contact number .
neutral	the staff were very friendly but debateable if i would use them again .
neutral	the range of products is fantastic , with heaps of stuff you can '_t find in stores .
neutral	but be careful of the images !
neutral	the images are heavily photoshoped , so colours can come out very differently ie something that looks white can turn out to be yellow .
neutral	and fabrics will often be cheap less durable fabrics .
neutral	really inspect the photos , and if in doubt , don_'_t get it !
neutral	all that being said i have had some really good buys , with super_fast shipping and usually decent customer_service ( they accept_returns for faulty goods , but not colour or appearance variances )
neutral	the brush is a waste as i have a cat and does not like it too rough and he likes combs .
neutral	so i will give it to someone with a dog i guess .
neutral	the bracelet is impractical .
neutral	however the treats and toy is a hit and great .
neutral	i will buy them in the future .
neutral	i will cancel the monthly package so i can get the items form petflow i want for my cat instead of getting items not practical for a 00 yo cat .
neutral	be nice if you asked for info about animal to meet needs .
neutral	thanks any way for giving us a chance to try new items that is great
neutral	this is a terrific site with good info to help you decide what to buy , but i am disappointed with the latest change in the website .
neutral	i was told the shipping on my epson paper was free , but when i checked out , it did not offer free_shipping , but instead made me choose which shipping option i wanted for $ 0 . 00 .
neutral	bait and switch is not appreciated .
neutral	maybe i '_ll use adorama next time if this isn_'_t fixed .
neutral	i was disappointed to find that petsmart had better prices .
neutral	i guess the benefit is that the food is shipped to the house but you still pay extra for that .
neutral	overall , it '_s not worth the extra money unless you have a coupon and get free_shipping .
neutral	the capsules from fine_coffee club are made of plastic rather_than aluminum , so the look and feel is not the same .
neutral	it is a bit more difficult to press the lever down prior to making a cup .
neutral	at first we were afraid we might break the machine we had to press so hard .
neutral	but it appears to be working fine now that we are used to it .
neutral	overall the quality of the coffee is good , maybe not quite as good as nespresso '_s .
neutral	the shopping and delivery was flawless .
neutral	bought a lot of xmas stocking_stuffers .
neutral	funny stuff
neutral	i flew out of minneapolis on the same morning as president obama flew in .
neutral	we sat in our delta plane on the tarmac for 0 . 0 hours !
neutral	missed my connecting_flight out of atlanta .
neutral	at_least finding and purchasing tix via travelocity was smooth - sailing .
neutral	c ' est la vie !
neutral	good service and received calls from drivers on the morning of the flights .
neutral	only issue was i received confirmation emails and texts which matched up to the flights i booked , but on the ' print screen ' pages , the collection times were different .
neutral	i think there is a cell on your website where it asks for collection time but it '_s not clear whether it '_s for the outbound or return flight so there was a bit of confusion .
neutral	thanks
neutral	you were supposed to notify when you shipped food and the food was here before needed .
neutral	took 0 more weeks
neutral	very easy to find and compare prices .
neutral	once we got to the storage_facility that we picked , it was quite the same descriptions / prices / sizes as stated on selfstorage . com
neutral	i have " attempted " to place 0 separate_orders on 00dollarmall . com and each time i paid and received a confirmation_email .
neutral	the first order , i received very promptly however , it was missing something .
neutral	nobody bothered to tell me that one of my items was out of stock and it wouldn_'_t be re - stocked - i had to call them to find out !.
neutral	they were awesome at the customer_service part , extremely_helpful and nice ( i know it wasn_'_t there fault the website showed items in stock that really weren_'_t ).
neutral	i then placed a second order , same thing !
neutral	i received a successful order confirmation and it wasn_'_t until a couple of days_later - this time i did get an_email_saying my order was canceled - however with no_explanation so i called .
neutral	was told the item was out of stock !
neutral	take it off your website then before people place orders !
neutral	so frustrating !
neutral	( i really wanted those boots too !)
neutral	:)
neutral	amazon has almost always been a very good website , though i have encountered an_error .
neutral	i was charged for something i never recieved .
neutral	i believe this was the fault of a third_party , but i think it reflects poorly on amazon as a whole that there is not assurance or screening process for whom they deal with .
neutral	easy shopping , efficient delivery , however quality of product disappointing .
neutral	have returned item and are waiting for refund .
neutral	i love the idea of giving out gift_cards that could be used anywhere .
neutral	i '_m all for it !
neutral	but i have seen some problems .
neutral	the designs are very limiting , i could not find too many that i liked or matched what my recipient ( my music loving sister ) wanted .
neutral	i also had no shipping date or tracking_number .
neutral	how would i know my gift arrived on time ?
neutral	or when it was going to arrive ?
neutral	i wouldn_'_t .
neutral	however , that being said , the site was friendly and payment was easy .
neutral	i have yet to receive my third item i ordered almost a month_ago .
neutral	and no money returned .
neutral	i was really excited to see the layout of the program .... very user_friendly .
neutral	then i got to the id vault section that is included with the subscription .
neutral	that is when i realized it requires windows xp , vista or windows 0 .
neutral	i am an apple mac user all the way and shocked they didn_'_t allow for those not on microsoft .
neutral	very disappointing !
neutral	!
neutral	i am really surprised this review was sent to me as it took 0 visits before my dryer was repaired .
neutral	it is now operating perfectly .
neutral	i really believe it was a personnel issue .
neutral	my dryer had a strange smell but was was getting hot and drying the clothes .
neutral	repairman came said the smell was lint fires , he cleaned everything took 0 0 / 0 hours n left .
neutral	i used the dryer and now it had a different odor .
neutral	he came back and said something had dislodged and it was venting inside the dryer .
neutral	he fixed it , apologized and left .
neutral	i used the dryer it was ice cold .
neutral	same guy returned and said some part had worn out ( like my patience ).
neutral	i called the company they sent a new repairman who was here less_than 00_minutes and all is well .
neutral	the company was very responsive so i give them credit
neutral	i really like this site , but they don_'_t always ship what you order then you have to email them to be credited for items not shipped . if you call on the phone for customer_service , plan on being on hold for an average of 00_minutes .
neutral	it is very frustrating not receiving what you order , and have to get_ahold them to be refunded !
neutral	!
neutral	i have ordered a 0 times , just this past week , and was short shipped on both orders
neutral	i like the facility , however it seems that the corporate headquarters have only the bottom_line in their heads .
neutral	the bait and switch comes to my mind , you are given a somewhat great deal to start , then look out a few_months later the price increases starts .
neutral	i had a problem with another facility and was advised to speak to the main office .
neutral	let_me tell you i was so disgusted with the way that man spoke to me , i would not recommend this company to anyone .
neutral	he was very unprofessional , and now i understand the reason_why some of the lower level people act the way they do .
neutral	it must be a bitch to work for for this company
neutral	due to the fact that my items were shipped from two locations i was charged $_00 . 00 and i feel that i should of only been charged 0 shipping charge for the order that i placed
neutral	i received the product ordered in a timely_manner without_any fuss , but when package arrived the product packaging looked like it went thru the war .
neutral	product was all over the box .
neutral	not professional .
neutral	ordered highway to heaven 0 and it didn_'_t come with order sooo blow off answer when i asked when i would get it was " gee your the second one today to call about that "-- when i asked again " oh i don_'_t know , call us if it don_'_t show up in 00 or 00 days "-- would have been nice if i had gotten a firm date .
neutral	i only got five items and ended_up returning three .
neutral	all of which had some_sort of readily apparent defect .
neutral	i spoke to the company and they assured_me that their items were not defective .
neutral	i just don_'_t_believe that ; that many defective items tells_me that that is what they are buying wholesale ; defective merchandise .
neutral	i took them out of my facebook likes , as well as their sister company " 00dollarmall " ( seemingly the same deal : selling defects ).
neutral	i would not recommend either site , and neither will get my money going forward .
neutral	took a week and a half to get my part , bad customer_service .
neutral	i won_'_t order from them again
neutral	i hear of that twitter is so popular around , so i register it , but i found it is difficult to me , i don_'_t know how to post photo , find friends and many other things , oh , i think i am out
neutral	easy to use website .
neutral	good deals .
neutral	nice gui and presentation of info .
neutral	it frustrates me to pay another fee when paying with credit_card .
neutral	so if i find the same deal , in another website , without_having to pay credit_card charges , i will change to that website .
neutral	comprar foi fácil , o único problema é que eu nunca recebi os produtos .
neutral	fico muito triste com isso pois , já passaram mais de três meses , e nada .
neutral	o pior de tudo é que o número de rastreio não funciona , eu coloco para rastrear no site dos correios a mensagem que tenho é que não há dados da compra , e coloco no site muambator , aparece como pacote não rastreável , e pior de tudo é que fiquei sabendo pelo correio que_se a encomenda não é rastreável , eles vem em casa com tres tentativas de entrega , mas como nao dá para rastrear , a encomenda volta , e nao tem como eu saber se vieram ou nao , pois eles nao deixam aviso para esse tipo de encomenda .
neutral	é uma grande pena , pois eu faço uso de suplementos , mas infelizmente fiquei no prejuizo , e nao tem como comprar mais , pois nao sei se vou receber , e também nao quero mais perder dinheiro .
neutral	the display boards arrived within 0 days of ordering , but they do not click onto each other very well .
neutral	our room was fine until we tried to sleep .
neutral	the curtains could not close , they were narrow decoration though made to be light stopping .
neutral	someone had placed a strong clip on one curtain and i soon pulled both curtain edges across the window and clipped them together .
neutral	still there was a triangle of light at the top of the window that beamed through near my pillow .
neutral	there are many very bright lights on very tall poles on the highway just across the parking_lot .
neutral	i chose not to stay at the end of our trip abroad because of that and the cost that more than doubled from our sunday_night_stay to the friday nearly two_weeks_later .
neutral	though the hotel was near the airport they did not provide free parking , they required payment to allow my car to be parked in a nearly empty parking_lot .
neutral	no free breakfast either .
neutral	petflow has_been a great place to order my dog '_s food , treats etc .
neutral	from .
neutral	because of my satisfaction with their service and prices i decided to try the spoiled_rotten program .
neutral	i was very disappointed !
neutral	this box cost me $_00 . 00 after i used a special $ 0 . 00 coupon .
neutral	the contents in the box added up to $_00 . 00 - all of which were available on sale from their website .
neutral	i could have had twice the items for this price .
neutral	i should have sent it back but i will just call it a lesson_learned .
neutral	no more unseen purchases !
neutral	i thought it would be a fun experience - not so !
neutral	no problem in getting into car_park but on exit the ' barrier ' was telling_me i owed £_00 .
neutral	not what i wanted to see at 00 : 00_hrs .
neutral	had to wait several minutes whilst waiting for ' assistance call ' to be answered and luckily a long_queue had not formed .
neutral	i saw an advertisement for leash '_s and collars that light up when you are walking your pets at nite to help keep them safe .
neutral	i ordered them and 0 really cute little bone shape '_s that would also light up at a very special low price .
neutral	they did not arrive with my order although i was charged for them .
neutral	when i complained , my money was refunded for the two bones i did not receive i was told i would receive them free of charge for the inconveinance once supplies were available .
neutral	( they were out of stock ), of course i didn_'_t ever get them .... now they are available but when i tried to order them again they are no_longer on sale ........ i like the items i received ....... not happy with their follow_up customer_service .
neutral	there were 0 of us , we all bought the passes on the friday_afternoon .
neutral	however , we tried to go to top of the rock , but there was a problem , so we pre_- booked for the next_day .
neutral	however , this activated our cards , and we lost an entire day '_s use ( although they did refund a day afterwards ).
neutral	also check whether what you want to go to is open every day , and also whether there are any events ( such as the cycle race ) which will limit your travel on any days during your stay
neutral	i like everything i buy from easy_comforts but i don_'_t have a computer ( i '_m 00 ) i order by mail or phone .
neutral	i returned the clothing because the sizes were too big and not the quality i .
neutral	expected
neutral	im very happy with my purchase , however , i think more than 0_weeks is a bit much to wait ..... especially if you really need your glasses ..... i will order again .
neutral	they have great prices , but you cant call them when u have a problem or question !
neutral	that is a problem for me !
neutral	and emails are slow , so im not sure i would use them again !
neutral	it was not typed as accurate as i thought it would .
neutral	makes the conversation look different than if you listen to the recording .
neutral	missing information that transcriptionist couldn_'_t understand .
neutral	sangat smart idea dan sangat membantu
neutral	setup was simple and easy and truck driver was helpful and nice .
neutral	upon_arrival at the storage_facility things were very disorganized .
neutral	i was ignored and i waited far too long .
neutral	my boyfriend uses this website regularly and receives his items the next_day , as_advertised throughout the site .
neutral	when i ordered an item recently , i assumed it was in stock as i wasn_'_t told otherwise , however i received an_email 0 days_later saying that it had finally been dispatched .
neutral	however , my account my order status had been ' completed / dispatched ' for a few_days already .
neutral	a bit annoyed with the lack of communication_regarding my item clearly not being in stock / the delayed dispatch , as this item was a gift for my boyfriend .
neutral	disappointed this time .
neutral	the quality of the products received are great !
neutral	however , i got 0 products that i did not order and was charged for those and i did not get 0 products that i had ordered .
neutral	pro_world returned them and issued credit for them without_any explanation to me .
neutral	i also paid for 0 day shipping and it was 0 days getting to me , not sure if that was a pro_world issue or the shipping company .
neutral	i did not like the way the box was packed . a 00_lb_bag of dry_dog_food was in with some crunchy cookie treats and a 00 pack of canned_food .
neutral	there were no peanuts or any kind of bubbled plastic to cushion in between , so the treats were crushed .
neutral	what we ordered arrived , and the bathroom fitments were good quality .
neutral	but the arrangements for delivery are poor - we live in a flat , the driver dropped the pallet on the kirb and had no interest in helping to shift the items upstairs , or in disposing of the wooden_pallet left over .
neutral	i have been researching this cancun trip for 0 months and every time , i see a better rate and flight , i try to book , but then the flight changed and it was either more_expensive or the flight times were outrageous ( 0 hour layovers , or 0 stops instead of 0 or overnight ).
neutral	so finally , i checked on easter_weekend and found a reasonable flight and lower_rate for this gorgeous all - inclusive resort at grand sunset princess suites and was lucky to book it with no changes .
neutral	but then i emailed my friends to join us and all the flights had all ready changed .
neutral	unbelievable .
neutral	my suggestion is to book it quickly or wait for another opportunity .
neutral	usual rushing about but my suitcase got mangled going and murdered coming home
neutral	offered led dog_bone for 00_cents with an order and after it was shipped told me they were out of led dog bones , cheat !
neutral	it was easy to purchase the gift but i was a bit annoyed to pay so much for shipping .
neutral	still , it was easier than going shopping .
neutral	my husband and i were using a contoured memory_foam pillow until we bought the duplex buckwheat / millet pillow .
neutral	we spent a lot of time adjusting the pillows and my husband is happy with his but i still have not been able to get comfortable .
neutral	i wake_up with neck_pain that i never had before .
neutral	i wish i could love the pillow but i am sadly disappointed .
neutral	i placed my order on november_00th .
neutral	the portion shipped from royal_canin arrived on nov . 00th and petflow reported issues with getting a verbal okay from my vet during thanksgiving week .
neutral	the remainder of my order , which was shipped from petflow , didn_'_t arrive until the 00th .
neutral	my original confirmation_email from petflow said my order would begin processing on monday , nov . 00th , yet i received no further information on shipping until i complained on friday , nov . 00rd .
neutral	seems to me like it just got spaced out .
neutral	my dogs are happy , i am happy , my mother is happy , my land lord .....
neutral	i felt_like the customer_service was excellent and i enjoyed_working with people that were attempting to meet my needs .
neutral	i was a little frustrated as i felt trapped in which i needed a car for work but had bad credit .
neutral	i was charged almost $ 0 , 000 over the price of the car and my interest_rate was incredibly high .
neutral	by the time i am done paying for this car i will have paid almost $_00 , 000 for this car and that in itself feels_like a rip_off .
neutral	i wish there was a car company out there that was willing to help people get their credit back on track without costing them an_arm and a leg .
neutral	the shipment was correct and timely .
neutral	however , the chicken treats i ordered did not explain online that they were made in china .
neutral	after the recall i refuse to buy any treats or dog_food made outside of the usa .
neutral	you would think a reputable_company such as dogwells wouldn_'_t support dog_food products made in china .
neutral	i will be returning the treats and hopefully your return process is as smooth as the order process .
neutral	extra large size is really a medium_size , disappointing for the price .
neutral	if you want one item you should be able to buy one item .
neutral	i had to buy 0 items to get the one i wanted .
neutral	i wanted the pet zoom only .
neutral	it is not worth the price .
neutral	it doesn_'_t release well and it does not adjust
neutral	after shopping around , i found the dog_food i wanted at a great price and was excited to find that delivery time was 0 - 0 days , just like all the other online pet_food companies .
neutral	similarities stopped there .
neutral	on two occasions , delivery took at_least 0 business days from date of order ( with my pets food out there in 000_degree plus heat ) to arrival and i live in the middle of the u . s .
neutral	when petflow says it shipped and fedex '_s system of product receipt do not reflect the same date , so i '_m going back to one of the other_companies that gets me my pets food in 0 - 0 days as_advertised .
neutral	i bought a shower riser bracket , soap dish and shower_gel hook .
neutral	the riser did not fit even_though i checked my measurements , the soap dish sits at an angle because it is too big and the gel hook does not fit at all .
neutral	i '_m going to start all over again .
neutral	although the collection and drop_off timings worked well on drop_off driver struggled to understand_english which constituted in my completing the ticket on his behalf !
neutral	rather frustrating and too timely when you are in a rush to get into the airport !
neutral	asked same questions several_times , called 0 times
neutral	i enjoy facebook very much , i on the other hand do not like all the changes that have occured .
neutral	i will still be an_avid facebook user , just wish they would slow_down all the changes and let the techology paused catch up .
neutral	the collect_plus service takes a lot longer_than the old way of sending via_royal_mail , it took a week to reach you !
neutral	also the processing time was redicously long !
neutral	all in all it '_s taken almost 0 month to get my money !
neutral	the website makes it look and suggests quickness and ease , i found this not to be the case !
neutral	i don_'_t remembering it taking this long last time and would seriously reconsider using the service again !
neutral	really disappointed !
neutral	i like the idea of auto_ship - i selected once a month - to try different dog_food ( abby - lab_mix ) is a picky_eater - but however - i wanted to select different food once a month - i couldn_'_t figure_out how change my options - maybe i wanted to try something different every other month .... i got frustrated - and made me want to cancel the whole thing .
neutral	i had to email them and ask them for help - emailed me very next_day ( which was great )
neutral	ask them how to change the food if i wanted to - and i had to email them back with what i wanted to change - . like i said , i may want to change the food every_month - or every other month on auto_ship - and i want the option to decide every_month what i want to change - my dear abby has allergies - and not every food i order will agree with her .
neutral	please help me - i really like the idea of auto_ship - but i also want the control and freedom to change the food every_month - or every other month - or even adding items .
neutral	on my own - without email someone of my choices - and they make the changes for me - because next month - i may decide on a different food - and will have to go through the emailing process all over again - about changes .
neutral	i may cancel the auto - ship all together - and perhaps find a pet - auto_ship site that will allow me to have that freedom .
neutral	i do like pet - flows choices of high_quality food and treats - but i like the freedom to shop - browse and chose on my own with auto_ship items - without evolving a 0rd_party ... love u petflow and your site - but i need more elbow room --- and please - please make it easy - abby keeps me on my toes with her picky eating_habits - and allergies
neutral	yes thank_you the sales dept .
neutral	did what i asked and designated my cartridges be sent by aus .
neutral	post .
neutral	but
neutral	despatch put the two small packets into a box four times their size ( ex wine box ) and sent it by australia post but to be signed for on receipt !!
neutral	!
neutral	which_meant that the postie left a parcel card in my rsd ( roadside delivery ) box beside the road - yes i live in the country .
neutral	so i still had to travel to swan hill to the post_office with the card and sign for and collect the box with the two small boxed cartridges inside .
neutral	i have no trouble with ink_station products just with the delivery .
neutral	by the way ink spot has no more discount shopper dockets - your spot has_been taken over by wholesaletoner . com . au
neutral	recievied my order on time .
neutral	the items were ( 0 ) 00 " hx 0 " w x 0 " d . the box was 00 " h x 00 " w x 00 " long .
neutral	packaging for protection was loose and not protecting the items at all .
neutral	i ordered a pair of ruby red slipper shoes with sequence all over them for my daughters wizard of oz theme_party , along with seven pairs of ruby red slipper style slip ins for her guests .
neutral	after less_than an_hour of wearing the shoes the sequin began to fall off , i found them all over her carpet .
neutral	i called customer_service and the operator told me repeatedly that i should expect that , because they ' re only costume shoes ( that cost 00 . 00 ).
neutral	after explaining to her that i realize that they were costume , but i feel_like they should have at_least lasted for her 0 hour party , she said she couldn_'_t replace or return them because they have been worn .
neutral	she offered 0 %_off the order .
neutral	so , not the greatest product , customer_service wasn_'_t all that great either .
neutral	i wanted a cover to protect my kindle_fire and thought this would be a great cover .
neutral	unfortunately , the cover slightly cuts off my vision om the left hand side of the screen .
neutral	also there '_s a permanent bend in the cover , only i '_m not sure where or how i '_m supposed to be bend .
neutral	i " ll figure it out eventually .
neutral	it was an easy and quick site to use , other_sites i tried ordering from were tricky to figure_out .
neutral	had a variety of label options that were customizable .
neutral	only problem that i had was the package showed_up slightly_bent and the label paper had a small crease .
neutral	i put it under some heavy books and t looks fine now .
neutral	however , maybe look into sturdier packaging .
neutral	overall a good experience .
neutral	beautiful coats but sizes were smaller_than stated ( i measured my sons ).
neutral	had to return them at a cost of over_£_00 .
neutral	the box arrived today .
neutral	in it was a small bag of dog_food and a box of honest_kitchen dog_food .
neutral	the small bag was ripped_open in the middle ... no_longer usable .
neutral	hope it keeps as i wasn_'_t ready to open it .
neutral	customer_service was excellent .
neutral	i specified specifically which type of contact_lens i needed in the notes , but the wrong ones were mailed out .
neutral	the company immediately mailed out the right ones when i called in .
neutral	the delivery was within_00hours but they sent one man for a huge box clearly_labelled that it need two .
neutral	he then moaned as my front_door was about 00metres from the kerb and stated he should leave to 000kg box on the kerb .
neutral	given that i have a serious back injury and live alone i told him to take it away .
neutral	he eventually brought it to my door but again said he had to leave it outside .
neutral	i persuaded him to at_least shove it into the hall - we did this together .
neutral	he left .
neutral	it took me 0hour 00_minutes to get it the 00 feet from my hall to my dining_room .
neutral	i couldn_'_t move the next_day .
neutral	most_recent order for canon cartridges did not fit .
neutral	printer could not recognize the particular ink tank .
neutral	requested resolution to this problem 0_weeks_ago , and they have not updated the status , i . e_., if they can provide the proper cartridge .
neutral	i have never had any_problems with inkfarm in the past , they '_ve always been able to take_care of the very few minor issues i had .
neutral	i '_ve used their remanufactured_cartridges for 0 - 0 years .
neutral	twice i '_ve had deliveries that came on the 0th day of a 0nd day delivery ( yes , it was placed early in day ) and both_times they were damaged .
neutral	tablets crushed from being tossed around .
neutral	the last shipment arrived looking like it had fallen_off the truck and been run over , looked accordion - like .
neutral	i '_m still_waiting for the return_label so i can get my money back , not sure how easy or fast that is .
neutral	as far as the product goes , when deliveries work out well , i have no_problems .
neutral	i do believe you can get good rated products at good prices and they arrive timely * for the most part *.
neutral	still_waiting for back - ordered item
neutral	i am writing this review at the request of opticontacts , although i haven_'_t received my order yet .
neutral	at this time , the order status is still " processing_".
neutral	so , i will update my review if i am able to when / if the shipment goes out .
neutral	[ 0000 - 00 - 00 ] -> processing
neutral	[ 0000 - 00 - 00 ] -> verifying rx
neutral	[ 0000 - 00 - 00 ] -> order received
neutral	in general , goldstar has offered tickets for many events that i '_m interested in at a good price , but there have been a few problems .
neutral	on 0 may , 0000 , we took the blue and gold alcatraz boat_cruise .
neutral	the address listed to pick_up tickets was 000 beach st . , which was wrong - the actual address was the blue and gold ticket window on jefferson st , 0 blocks_away .
neutral	as my husband is physically disabled , this was a hardship for him .
neutral	the cruise itself was very interesting , and the goldstar price was very reasonable .
neutral	there have been other problems as well - a couple of times , i '_ve paid for tickets for 0st balcony or mezzanine performances and when i go to the box office , they give me 0nd balcony tickets .
neutral	when i explain that i bought better tickets , the box office says that we have to resolve it with goldstar , which of course , i can '_t on the night of the performance .
neutral	i think this is more the box office '_s fault than goldstar , but it '_s still annoying .
neutral	swim caps were fine .
neutral	delivery was fast .
neutral	but no wonder shipping is so expensive : a few tiny lycra caps that would have fit in a business envelope were shipped in an_enormous box .
neutral	such a waste .
neutral	when the iron is on low withe the covers the patch peels off a little and gets a little distorted .
neutral	the designs are good and work for the basic purpose
neutral	i ordered 0 sets of christmas_tree lights , one lot were fine the other set were not as good as i expected , i called and asked to return and was told i would be charged £_00 but only £ 0 if i placed another order .
neutral	i would happily have ordered the higher volume of lights but they don_'_t stock them , and therefore i couldn_'_t place another order .
neutral	i returned via_royal_mail at a cost of £_00 .
neutral	the delivery was quick and the items were well_packaged but i would only use again if i knew i would not need to return the item .
neutral	i ordered topper for around my ceiling .
neutral	i got 0 double rolls of wallpaper
neutral	it should have been so easy , but it took me two phone_calls and a lot of time to make hotel reservations for four rooms .
neutral	i thought it would be easier to call the hotel reservation line directly and get the best price .
neutral	the associate was very nice and tried to be helpful , but i had to ask for the discounted price i had seen on line .
neutral	i don_'_t know why , but it took her a very long time to make the reservation ; unfortunately , she had not noted that we preferred to be on the same floor either , so she had to go back into the computer to add the request ; we need to double - check at the desk when we arrive to see if the hotel can accommodate this request .
neutral	all the rooms had to be put in my name .
neutral	i received the confirmation by email within_seconds , which was good , because it was wrong .
neutral	she had booked us for only one night !
neutral	so i called back to correct the reservation .
neutral	the person i talked to insisted that i do a separate booking because the first reservation is " non_- refundable ."
neutral	no changes can be made .
neutral	then the associate told me that it was going to cost the full price per room on saturday ; that the promotion was only on friday .
neutral	i didn_'_t think that was right based on my previous conversation , so i kept challenging that until he admitted he was looking at the " wrong date ."
neutral	i then asked him to note that we do not want to have four rooms on one night and then have to move again on saturday with the second reservation .
neutral	he said it shouldn_'_t be a problem , but that he would make a note , and that we should confirm at the desk when we check in .
neutral	we now have two confirmation numbers , one for each night .
neutral	very frustrating .
neutral	next time i '_ll do it on line with expedia .
neutral	customer_service representative was less_than helpful when i called to ask a question about how fast the card would be loaded and available to my sister .
neutral	the only response i got was it would be processed within 00_hours after they opened on monday_morning .
neutral	the website did not state that a purchase would not be processed on the weekend .
neutral	a scan bar would also be helpful when the gift_card prints out since we needed to wait for a manager to override the system to hand key the number in .
neutral	i '_ll bet that causes you to lose sales .
neutral	women that we collected the tickets from was one of those people who made it very obvious she would rather be anywhere_else than at work that day .
neutral	she was irritated by any questions outside the sales speil she is trained to give , zero eye contact with the customer and wholly uncivil in her demeanor .
neutral	both myself and my partner commented that had she worked for us she would be gone .
neutral	from then on a completely positive_experience pass saved us time and money the bus loops were brilliant , and the discounts from on the spot prices brilliant , definitely would recommend the pass and have done only yesterday .
neutral	attitude adjustment needed from the woman_who served_us that morning .
neutral	i always expect a dented can or 0 depending_on how many i buy ,.. but ; out of 00 cans over half were dented & many of them bad enough that i had a really hard time opening them : however , they were not " bloated ", and so_far i haven_'_t come_across any compromised seals , & the packaging ( padding ) was acceptable , & the plastic over the bags was in good shape ...
neutral	so , for those reasons , the shipment gets 0 instead of 0 .
neutral	nice that i can find the bags that i need for my canister vacuum , however not so nice that the cost to ship the bags was almost as much as the cost of the bags themselves .
neutral	not so impressed with this .
neutral	0 .
neutral	the box took to . long to get here .
neutral	0 , there should be more in the box .
neutral	the things that were in the box were okay .
neutral	there should be a more variety of things .
neutral	i had a problem checking into the hotel .
neutral	i '_m still_waiting for resolution .
neutral	i was quite disappointed , i had purchased from you some time ago and felt it was lot cheaper , quicker and better quality .
neutral	the material came to a lot and to be honest was not that great quality , delivery took 0 days and cost £ 0 . 00 , so i thought it would be a lot better .
neutral	apologies my postage was just under £ 0 , still disappointed !
neutral	i have trying to contact someone about my order .
neutral	i left a msg friday .
neutral	hope to hear from you monday .
neutral	you need more phone contacts for customer_service .
neutral	so we can feel more assured we will be taken_care of .
neutral	thank_you ,
neutral	my oil was delivered quickly but i wish the driver had got in touch with me as i wanted him to put in the boiler max additive which i had ordered and paid for .
neutral	i was in the house at the time but didn_'_t hear him .
neutral	i was told the driver would contact me before he delivered .
neutral	hi i order dis item last wed and i haven_'_t received it yet i need it for friday nyt cheers
neutral	really surprised that customer has to pay for returns .
neutral	it stopped me re ordering in a different size .
neutral	you could use collect +!
neutral	like other_companies do
neutral	difficult to fill in order form .
neutral	i kept having to refill rejected information .
neutral	took four tries to complete .
neutral	price was right for item i wanted but bad forms can be a tie breaker for future orders .
neutral	missed friday shipping when ordered , lost weekend moving towards me = 0 extra days to arrive .
neutral	part was a ac_compressor and made noise and would not hold pressure until it ran for almost an_hour .
neutral	would have exchanged part but would have had to pay honda double labor $_000 x0 .
neutral	works good with fingers_crossed but still slightly_lower pressure .
neutral	have to run ac fan one position less_than full speed or air comes too fast and is warm .
neutral	if it never breaks it will be ok
neutral	the sales_assistant last time was so helpful and so pleasant .
neutral	i didn_'_t find the staff quite so friendly and helpful this time .
neutral	though i knew the journals i ordered were not leather , they looked to be of better quality in the photos than what they actually are .
neutral	perhaps a clearer description of the material they are made of would have painted a more accurate picture .
neutral	the length of the strap on the journal also covers part of the logo .
neutral	i didn_'_t have a choice of where to place the logo and on the sample pictures the strap does not cover any of that logo .
neutral	i am pleased with the quality of the debossing .
neutral	i will probably try one more product before i make my final_decision with the company .
neutral	i am very glad i ordered the minimum quantity .
neutral	i am happy with the service so_far , they have already caught something with my personal record that i would have not found unless i was looking .
neutral	the only_thing i am not happy with is the computer protection .
neutral	they do not have protection for mac computers yet .
neutral	come on now , identity_guard , get with the times , there are a growing number of mac users out there and we should not be forgotten .
neutral	so i signed_up for separate computer protection from a different company .
neutral	i am happy with the customer_service so_far , when i signed_up , i signed_up for the $ 0 . 00 package , and later my husband signed_up also and for some_reason it was $_00 . 00 for the same package .
neutral	i called and they made us both have the $ 0 . 00 package no problem .
neutral	it matters where you sign_up because they have different promotional rates .
neutral	the only matter we found disappointing about our delivery was the amount of rubbish we were left to deal with .
neutral	we had ordered a lot of furniture and each piece was very well_packed and in a large cardboard_box .
neutral	it took us a long time to unpack and we were then left with a mountain of rubbish to get_rid of which resulted in two trips to the council tip .
neutral	i understand that the company are trying to go green but wouldn_'_t it be better for everybody if they dispossed of the rubbish responsibly considering the money that the customer is paying .
neutral	other than that we are very pleased with our furniture .
neutral	j parker
neutral	bestilte nogle fede boots , som_jeg dersværre måtte returnere pga .
neutral	forkert størrelse .
neutral	fra dagen jeg sendte dem , til jeg_fik mine_penge overført tilbage igen gik der omkring en_uge .
neutral	det_er lige lang_tid nok .. ellers god service og fin kvalitet (-:
neutral	det_var_en okay oplevelse , at handle der .
neutral	der_var dog ikke noget der_var fantastisk , eller det omvendte .
neutral	det_var ok
neutral	they ' re very bright especially on my street , we only have street lights at the corners .
neutral	they ' re easy to hook to the dog '_s collar .
neutral	but they are extremely difficult to turn on / off .
neutral	i have to use both hands to get it to turn on / off .
neutral	i ordered 0 blue lights , and i tried 0 different ones and they ' re both the same , very hard to press to turn on / off .
neutral	i have other blinking lights for my dogs that are red , ( not as bright ) but all you have to do is push on the top to turn on / off .
neutral	i '_m able to do it with one hand .
neutral	if it weren_'_t for the difficulty turnning on / off they would be great .
neutral	i like to start with the positives .
neutral	the sash i ordered was beautiful .
neutral	i ordered feather clips for the bridesmaids with party buttons that arrived in perfect_condition .
neutral	i ordered a veil with a headband tiara .
neutral	the tiara was completely hanging by a thread off the headband .
neutral	i don_'_t have time to send it back so i have to superglue it .
neutral	this was disconcerning and disappointing .
neutral	i am a first time customer and not sure i will use the site again for this reason .
neutral	i have shopped here a few_times and made two purchases .
neutral	i love their generous return_policy especially_since i had to use it on my first order .
neutral	the website '_s sizing can be a bit_tricky to read ( i am considered a plus size here ) and the descriptions are sparse at best .
neutral	i usually can '_t go by the reviews on the site because they are not well written or seem to be written by people who have actually purchased the items .
neutral	i will keep shopping here for their value , but it is not my first choice .
neutral	good just wish it was a little more user_friendly .
neutral	when i looked for a part for my 0000_toyota prius , i did not know that i had to buy directly from a toyota supplier .
neutral	i thought if the description said " for " or fits toyota prius , then it would work on the car .
neutral	the part said for 0000_toyota prius , but it would not fit on my car .
neutral	rather frustrating !
neutral	the car i was assigned was terrific , although a little large for scottish roads and parking spots !
neutral	my biggest concern was the attitude of the clerk at the rental desk ...
neutral	he was bordering on insulting !
neutral	i do have personal car insurance with my own policy and with my credit_card company , he made me feel_like a criminal not taking the additional daily coverage for the vehicle !
neutral	not very welcoming .
neutral	yes , it is my choice to make those decisions , he should not judge me !
neutral	plus he was training a new employee , not the best training experience i believe !
neutral	no smiles , no welcome to scotland .... sad !
neutral	the product is supporting my tennis elbow but i did ask for some guidance on exactly where it should placed - ie below the knobbly bit on my elbow ( which is the bit that hurts ) or above or below .
neutral	no response .
neutral	the prices are the lowest that i '_ve found online .
neutral	the shipping and handling is a little high though .
neutral	i bought a back support the foam was so hard and unforgiving i could not use the product which i bought for lumber support ..
neutral	weigh too big in diameter for lumber support .
neutral	,
neutral	i like the website look and feel
neutral	however it could use an easier way to get to various plants .
neutral	maybe some other search options or building up / narrowing search choices .
neutral	biggest issue was looking up previous_orders ( history ) took so long ( minutes ) i could not wait .
neutral	i believe i only remember getting into my history 0 time ( and maybe i tired 0 times ) and then basically gave up trying in the future .
neutral	i was looking to track my orders to see what portion shipped ( i will wait for emails ).
neutral	emails on shipping came timely .
neutral	company is fine , quality is fine , website : starts 0 , 0 , 0 respectively
neutral	i can get the product cheaper at petco even after the discount that was offered for the first purchase .
neutral	the car was fine , although i was not familiar with the particular gear shift , and no one explained it when i picked it up .
neutral	it was said to be a shift car but appeared to be fluid drive - i was not aware that you changed the forward gear by twitching the knob in " d ".
neutral	when i complained the car was nicely exchanged in perugia .
neutral	i got charged twice but it was corrected when i pointed i it out .
neutral	the line at the rr station took_forever to pick_up the car and again when i returned it at_least an_hour both_times , maybe more - the other rental_agencies did not seem to have lines .
neutral	maybe auto europa is the cheapest , but they could use more help .
neutral	the staff were nice and competent .
neutral	the garage entrance is so tight that i scraped my 0 - passenger vehicle on the door when returning it .
neutral	i ordered a pair of elle designer_frames and was sorely disappointed because they were backordered .
neutral	i was contacted about this and offered a different color and refused , so they remained on backorder .
neutral	then i received an_email for a large discount that made the glasses 00 less .
neutral	then i canceled the order and reordered a similar elle frame and that was backordered for even longer .
neutral	i was again contacted .
neutral	i requested the frames to stay on back order .
neutral	i did receive the glasses sooner_than_expected but they were not my first choice of frames .
neutral	they are a comfortable fit and the prescription is correct but i sure do wish for the money that i spent i had been delivered the first pair i picked and wasn_'_t forced to settle for second best !
neutral	i probably_won_'_t order from this website again because it was too much hassle !
neutral	i purchased the a0 calendar , overall it '_s ok / good quality but could be better .
neutral	the ring binder of the calendar seems flimsy ( could easily pull a month off + considering the weight of the calendar would have expected a better binding ).
neutral	also 0 of the photos came out with tops & bottom cropped , even_though when uploading the photos i got a green symbol indicating the size was good .
neutral	the lack of options for editing the photos was quite poor .
neutral	could be a lot better considering the prices .
neutral	i went to book with these as it was the cheapest price i had found - however , when i actually confirmed the booking , the price increased to the original .
neutral	it was still less but was annoying and disappointing and left the experience feeling a little less like using these again .
neutral	i usually love this site , but recently they cancelled my order without explanation !!!
neutral	i was very disappointed
neutral	i ordered the clock for my father in law '_s birthday to go in his new garage .
neutral	when it arrived the clock was faulty .
neutral	mother in law called customer_services to report fault and ask for advice and they were told to fix it themselves .
neutral	great way to order and quick but stated 0 - 0 days delivery and when it didn_'_t arrive ( a friend ordered one the same day and agreed it stated this !)
neutral	i emailed to discuss the matter and was told that this was incorrect and that it never stated this at all .
neutral	when i went back on to have a look it had been removed !
neutral	best prices compare to other retailer , you don_'_t need doctor authorization for prescription .
neutral	navigate website easy .
neutral	customer_service feedback .
neutral	only compaint is shipping ; i '_m one of those people that like to know where my package is .
neutral	other than that everything else was fine .
neutral	very satisfied with the service and product but very disappointed with the packaging .
positive	this is the greatest_thing , once a month petflow sends a box of " goodies " for your pet .
positive	charlotte my shihtzu got her first one on december 00nd just in time for christmas .
positive	she got an adorable cow toy , some treats shes never tried before but seemed to like all of them .
positive	and some teeth cleaner that doesn_'_t involve brushing .
positive	i dont_know whos more excited about next month '_s package charlotte or me ...
positive	used this site many_times .
positive	i always start mysearch here .
positive	prices change daily and if you want to really research the price continually at many different sites , i have found cheaper cars elsewhere .
positive	however , if you don_'_t have a lot of time to research the price , this site has always been among the top three ( e . g_., cheapest ) of the ten sites i use to reserve a car .
positive	very impressed with speed and efficiency of service .
positive	ordered flowers for australia at around 00 : 00_hrs and received email from recipient the next_morning to confirm delivery .

positive	i brought a beko_dishwasher after much concideration , the price was different to other stores which was really good and the other stores didnt have it in stock ready in time for christmas .
positive	after paying for it a member of there team contacted me about my purchase and gave_me all the relevent information_regarding my dishwasher .
positive	the man on the phone was very polite and helpful even the delivery guys were polite and talkative too .
positive	i would definitely use this website again .
positive	i am very happy with the end_result and most_importantly the customer_service i received .
positive	the original order i received was the printed with the wrong color .

positive	an expensive product found very quickly and cheapest at that time - not a technical ordering system , so an easy transaction
positive	we ordered a garden vac / blower which compared to other_sites was great value , was due to be delivered very quickly and it was .
positive	unfortunately it was internally damaged , which tooled up could never have known about , but they collected the item the next available working day , and reshipped out a replacement with no_quibble , and no extra expense from me , which i think is great service .

positive	they also provided a payment plan .
positive	thanks !
positive	seriously coffee and books .. what is not to love ?
positive	the prices vary but are generally fair and so_far i have never had a major issue with online or in store purchases .
positive	i really liked using indeed since it grabs jobs from lots of different places and you can sort by date , positions etc .
positive	my only_gripe was not really their fault , since it '_s a job aggregate if the companies listing online have auto - renewal for listings it will say a job is new when it is actually just a re - posted one ... but again that is not indeed doing it .
positive	was a bit_unsure_about ordering as i dint know any who had used this website before . have used it twice_now . its cheap , easy to use and keep you well informed .
positive	i haven_'_t used their full services , but only go on pc_game supply to buy karma koin when i need it -- and they hold true to their word .
positive	i '_m very skeptical of buying game_cards online , so i google ' d around to see if people had bought from them .
positive	turns_out some people bought cards from them , and didn_'_t get scammed .
positive	gave it a try , and i got my codes from them after a good 0 - 0 minutes from purchasing .
positive	i ordered the telescopic magnet grab .
positive	my son has lost a screw in his bikes headlight !

positive	product as_described .
positive	i am on a rtw trip of a lifetime and i use hostelworld to make 00_% of my hostel reservations .
positive	it '_s idiot_proof really !
positive	and there apple and android apps make it even easier to use on the move .
positive	the only_negative i would say is that they don_'_t always show a hostels full availability so if there is somewhere in particular you want to stay check with the hostel directly before moving on .
positive	hodges has outdone themselves .
positive	the ribbons are beautiful .
positive	i cannot say thank_you enough for doing a wonderful job !

positive	after looking at hotels and hostels for the 0 of us , i was discouraged about the prices .
positive	then i saw housetrip .
positive	we found an apt .
positive	within our budget that allowed_us to easily get around paris , stay together as a family ( unlike a hostel ), and cook some of our own meals - all at a price better_than anything i saw elsewhere !!
positive	we were pleased with the entire_process , though it is a bit time_consuming to choose , send a notice , wait for a reply , etc .
positive	easier to just choose and book .
positive	but worth it in the long run because we were very pleased .
positive	easy to communicate with our host , which we did quite_often before our trup .

positive	what more can you ask for ?
positive	the on - line chat was very helpful and saved a trip to the store .
positive	the advice was more direct than on - line reviews , although they came to the same conclusions .
positive	i know b_&_h will stand by its products .
positive	petflow has not let us down , they have the food items and toys my four cats love .
positive	for me having it come to the house is wonderful and so many items to choose from .
positive	no negativity here as my four felines are happy so i am happy . and they are healthier as well ... which makes me very happy :-)
positive	i have been in the customer_service industry since 0000 and i feel that they have mastered the skill .
positive	my item was going to be on back order , not only did they email me , but they called me as well to ask me what i wanted to do .
positive	also , a small error occurred and they fixed it right_away sending me a postage paid return envelope and the scrub pants i needed .
positive	this is my first time renting_books but i was impressed with how easy it was to locate the books i needed and how quickly they arrived .
positive	totally cheaper_than buying a new book , and what a waste that is also using it for a couple months and then ... what ?

positive	i recently bought the classic_ii s . e .
positive	stethoscope and i couldn_'_t be_happier with my purchase .
positive	the quality of this item is great and worth the price , especially with the free_engraving which looks awesome !

positive	the liberty_freedom range is expensive , but beautiful , and made in england !, i '_ve been to berlin this weekend and wore it , loads of compliments , even from the sternest of airport security !

positive	next time i need a part for a do - it - yourself fix , i will_definitely check outpartsgeek first !
positive	!

positive	this was exactly_what i ordered .
positive	it came when promised and was intact .
positive	couldn_'_t be_happier .
positive	the entire team at onebuckresume was really great to work with .
positive	i used their executive - classic resume format and i have to admit i was a little_concerned_about it only being one dollar and all .
positive	prior to working with one buck , i had a dud of a resume that was getting no traction .
positive	my career is challenging to describe and i had done a pretty poor job of it .
positive	the resume builder quickly picked_up on the positive trends of my career and the qualities about myself and what i was looking for that needed to be emphasized in the resume .
positive	it did a great job .
positive	the process was so easy , too .
positive	everything is done by the resume building platform so it '_s very fast and uncomplicated .
positive	they asked me to complete a fairly thorough questionnaire that really helped_me reflect on my career .
positive	once that was done , i had a gorgeous resume as well as some cover_letter and thank_you letter templates .
positive	i had a few minor revisions that i requested and those were done immediately , no questions_asked .
positive	then , i hit the market .
positive	the questionnaire coupled with the resume were great for prepping for the interview .
positive	one buck_resume tries to draw out " stories " during the process and it made it seem so natural to use these stories in the interview process .
positive	i '_m happy to say that i have a new job and t was both the resume and the way this site got me to look at my accomplishments from a different point of view that gave_me the confidence to succeed .
positive	if you ' re unhappy with your resume , check out onebuckresume . com .
positive	one of the hiring managers i spoke to told me that i had the fanciest resume they had ever_seen .
positive	great service from environfone .
positive	they sent the reply envelope very quickly and within a week had confirmed that the phone i was selling was good quality and in working order and within another week i had the cheque in payment .
positive	thanks .

positive	it '_s great to have a 00 - lb_bag of dog_food delivered straight to home !
positive	my doctor advised me not to take a certain herb i had already ordered from pure_formula .
positive	tis due to possible interaction of my chemo med and the herb .
positive	i called and asked if i could mail it back and they sent me a prepaid return address label !
positive	my orders are usually received within a couple of days after entering them on computer website .
positive	they have large selections to choose from .
positive	the same glasses at the optical shop i went to was over $_000 , got them for almost_half price at frames_direct .
positive	i have a very strong prescription so the savings are amazing .
positive	would gladly recommend to friends and family .
positive	definately buy molarclean as its a good quality product and excellent value for money !
positive	i have been a monger since the 00 '_s , and my massage experience has never been better since massage parlor reviews hit the internet .
positive	since i first became a member about 0 years_ago i loved the site .
positive	around 0000 - 0000 , the site got a little sloppy and the speed was just average .
positive	i left for a while and came back , and they have really tightened the functionality of the site .
positive	the speed is much_faster , i am able to view many more profiles in less time .
positive	the reviews are very detailed now , many average 0 - 0 paragraphs .

positive	!
positive	good product selection and cs
positive	love the free_shipping - this allows me to order what i need without_having to add unecessary items to reach a minimum for free_shipping .
positive	plus the prices are very competitive and they offer free_samples .
positive	shipping was prompt .
positive	this website is a keeper .
positive	i like using wowcher because i enjoy the diversity of the products that they have .
positive	the one thing i would say , which isn_'_t anything to do with the company itself but rather the companies that use them , regarding things like jewellery , they don_'_t turn up packaged very well there by casting doubt on the authenticity of the product they are selling .
positive	it would be good if the sellers gave an option to box your goods or not even if they charged a little more .
positive	i have ordered a few items of jewellery for gifts and each time felt disappointed that they had arrived in little plastic_bags as_opposed to if i had bought them at a shop .
positive	but that issue isn_'_t with wowcher because they are awesome !
positive	:-)
positive	i decided to change my sons name '_s to my married name and this service made it hassle_free .

positive	great service from a company i have been purchasing from for over 00 years
positive	i have repeatedly used memoryc over the last 0 years .
positive	i have never had any_issues with the products supplied by memoryc .
positive	they stock a wide_range of memory products .
positive	the delivery options are great .
positive	i have no reservations about recommending memoryc
positive	everything went so smooooothly in ordering , receiving and even installing my 0000 passat grill insert ( with fog ), that i almost_forgot all about the hideous speed bump that popped my old grill insert out of my car and into the middle of the street .
positive	i think the best compliment you can give a supplier is forgetting about the ordeal that compelled you to seek them out in the first place .
positive	i needed a gift_card for a friend asap , so i was fortunate to find the pc_games supply site !
positive	i was able to buy the gift_card and email it to my friend immediately .
positive	i '_ll probably shop at pcgamessupply . com again whenever i need more gift_cards .
positive	i am very satisfied with my purchase and the help i received .
positive	i will use your service , afeyewear in the future and recommend to others .
positive	no_fuss very easy to order on line .

positive	prompt confirmation , dispatch and delivery of ordered items .
positive	i received quick and reliable service while purchasing a rixty card code .
positive	recommend this company to anyone .
positive	i always book with them - they '_ve never let_me down .
positive	it was my first time order on the web .

positive	you had exactly_what i needed and received it promply ... i never trusted ordering by the web but have full_confidence on your products and prices ..
positive	thx
positive	great price and i received the item sooner_than i expected .
positive	thank_you .
positive	within 00_minutes of ordering delivery details were emailed and text to me and a one hour_window supplied for delivery .
positive	just wish all companies were this effective .
positive	excellent product , excellent service , excellent all_round .
positive	i have rated 0_stars as i do feel it is an excellent website , overall customer_service and price .
positive	however .... i specifically wanted a service that provided installation as i am a single_parent with a slight disability .
positive	my old_washer had began vibrating and making noises and as i felt this was due to it no_longer being level i asked the installers to make_sure that the new washer stood level .
positive	obviously they were rushing and simply said that i would need to sort that out myself and get a board to put underneath !
positive	a neighbour later kindly adjusted the feet of the washing_machine so that it stood level .
positive	this was a service that i thought i had already paid for .
positive	but overall i would recommend the site and would definitely use it again .
positive	i get the pet_food i need , when i need it , at a great price and shipped for free ... it can not get any better_than that !

positive	arrived very quickly from france , were just what we needed and were very easy to program .
positive	i have recently started_using enliven coconut body butter .
positive	i purchased this product because i had recently read about how good coconut is for the skin , and for a while i had been looking for a natural coconut moisturiser which was not tested on animals and which did not contain too many added chemicals or artificial ingredients .
positive	the enliven body butter was the only product i could find which met all my criteria and it was really good value too - much_cheaper_than similar products .
positive	i have now been using it for about a week and it is a beautiful product .
positive	it smells great and it glides onto my skin , leaving it silky smooth .
positive	i love this product , shall continue to use it and recommend it to all .
positive	thanks !
positive	delivery was very quick and on time , liked receiving the email with exact delivery time_slot .
positive	product very easy to put_together & seems to be working very well so_far !
positive	the website was very easy to use .
positive	my order came within one day of placing my order and i was given a time_slot when it would be delivered .
positive	highly_recommend using this website !
positive	this was my first experience of ordering oil via the internet ~ i need not have worried as the oil was delivered well in time ... so quickly that my tank did not get as low as i thought .
positive	even the refund for the over - payment was easy to handle !
positive	thank_you boilerjuice . com !
positive	i have used other online companies to autoship pet_food and treats etc .
positive	but none come close to beat out petflow '_s pricing and speed of delivery .
positive	they often offer trials from suppliers at deep_discounts for us to try .
positive	would definitely ( and have ) recommend this company to family and friends
positive	the greatt deals obtained through priceline are literally what have kept me from absolute homelessness .
positive	i lost my job in october_0000 and am able to survive this way as rents any other way are too high .
positive	there is a custom format for every occasion , presenting every experience in a fun and expressive way .
positive	my order of two brown glazed garden stools was followed_up quickly with very caring respectful e_- mails .
positive	delivery was very prompt and my order arrived perfect in very well_packaged boxes .
positive	i went to global to park my car for a business trip .
positive	they were fast , friendly and very accommodating .
positive	they also offer car cleaning .
positive	when i returned , i was brought back to my car and they even helped_me pack my luggage in the trunk .
positive	unlike those other services that drop you off and leave you to your own , they made sure i was returned to my car safely .
positive	i would recommend this place to anyone that needs to park their car prior to any trip .
positive	great service , cheapest good brand lenses , good telephone support , lenses arrived fast ...
positive	exactly_what i ordered and super_fast shipping !
positive	yes_style has always provided me with the best and updated fashions .

positive	when my last tumble_dryer developed a fatal fault i asked the repairman to recommend the best place to get a new one .
positive	he recommended ... appliances_online , " i get all my electricals from them ".
positive	he preferred appliances_online he said as even_though he received an employee discount appliances_online still worked out cheaper .
positive	after_researching different tumble dryers with as much care as i i did my last holiday , i made the big step and rang to order .
positive	the lady at the call_centre couldn_'_t have been nicer or more helpful .
positive	two_days_later i received a call saying my machine would be delivered around 0 . 00am .
positive	that morning .
positive	guess what ... at exactly 0 . 00am the door_bell rang and two very cheerful deliverymen brought my machine in with the minimum of fuss and the maximum of courtesy .
positive	my tumble_dryer operates exactly as_described in the appliance video .
positive	incidentally as someone disabled those videos were great as i could quickly rule out machines where , in the video , the door seemed stiff to open etc .
positive	in conclusion my choice of machine wasn_'_t the cheapest but experience has shown me that you generally get what you pay for .
positive	saying that it certainly wasn_'_t in the most expensive range .
positive	using it is a dream ; a large porthole , an operating dial that turns easily and a clear " time remaining " display .
positive	cleaning out lint after use is easy too .
positive	the only_downside for me is emptying the water tank but hey_ho that is what family are for .
positive	good communication and a very quick delivery thanks
positive	meget indbydende hjemmeside - bestilling nemt_og hurtigt .

positive	susanne , børkop
positive	very quick_turnaround , no_problems found in text .
positive	good job !
positive	it has taken over a year for my rescue cat , macy , to decide what she is willing to eat so i am new at ordering pet products online .
positive	i checked out several sites and started filling my cart from one of them .
positive	but when i tried to find 0_oz .
positive	cans of petguard cat_food , they did not carry that size .
positive	i needed the other things so i placed that order .
positive	then i went to your site and found the exact canned_foods i was looking for .
positive	i ordered the canned_food from you .
positive	thank_you for carrying the smaller_size cans and next time i order products , i will turn to mr . chewy first .
positive	your service is excellent .
positive	love my new stethoscope !
positive	it came in just a few_days and it was exactly how it looked online .
positive	love the engraving too !
positive	i had a surprise move come out of no where and i needed some quick cash !
positive	this was so easy to use !
positive	thanks !
positive	first time using pet_flow .. good value and fast service ... no_complaints
positive	thank_you - a great service !
positive	easy to use service , with quick payment !
positive	i discovered chewy . com after becoming concerned_about feeding my beloved kitties a common , named brand cat_food instead of the high_quality , more natural food that they deserve .
positive	after doing some online searching and finding chewy . com , i made some decisions and ordered two cases of nature '_s variety " instinct " in duck and rabbit .
positive	i also ordered some evo wild cravings treats and several other healthy snacks .
positive	i '_m lucky because our cats are not finicky but they have taken to this food like gang busters .
positive	the extra_cost is well_worth it and the free_shipping on larger orders was the final drawing card .
positive	my ordered arrived a day ahead of what i expected too .
positive	my friends told me they get all of their parts from here so i did .
positive	i '_m so satisfied with my order .
positive	will order again from here !
positive	i needed to ship my car from chicago to southern_california .
positive	when i first called montway , i had done a lot of research online .
positive	most car shipping companies are not recognized by the bbb , but montway has got a a rating .
positive	to me , this was very important because i have read a lot of horror_stories online .
positive	i was very nervous_about having my car shipped , and one of the team_members , bobby , was very patient and helpful in answering the abundance of questions i had for him .
positive	also , every time i called , the staff seemed very caring , available and willing to answer all questions .
positive	the best part was , my initial phone_call was to get a quote , and thereafter i did not receive phone_calls or emails soliciting my business , which was great .
positive	i called back when i was ready to book a pick_up .
positive	again , i found out about montway on my own after several weeks of research .
positive	most other_companies incessantly call or email you for your business , and in my opinion , this is a bad sign .
positive	although not the cheapest company out there , montway did offer a price match for another company quote i received that was of equal quality rating .
positive	( nice !)
positive	my vehicle was contracted out to a third_party contractor , ebs transport , and my driver , bagi , was great !
positive	he came when he said he was going to , and dropped my car off right in front of my home in california when he said he was going to .
positive	my car was in great shape with no damage .
positive	i had great communication with the driver and all parties responsible the whole time , which is something i was very concerned_about .
positive	i have already_recommended montway to a friend who is planning to ship her car from texas to washington_dc .
positive	i am positive she will also have a great experience .
positive	the shoes were dispatched and arrived_promptly , really pleased with them and with the service .
positive	would definitely use again
positive	i am a complete sewing_machine novice but this is exactly as_described and ideal for a beginner like me .
positive	great company to deal with

positive	i will buy none other .
positive	love how i can look up and find just about anything !
positive	can keep a person occupied all day long .
positive	live this site , makes transactions safe and secure and worry free .
positive	everything has shipped very fast .
positive	easy to track shipments , competitive_prices , good variety of inventory .
positive	i love this service , having to make a trip into town to buy dog_food , when i am out , is now one less thing i have to worry_about for my beautiful jack russells .
positive	such a convenience for me since i live an_hour out of town .
positive	i got the best deal and its locked in for my entire lease , also i did no running around to find the best price .
positive	i simply went to sparefoots website put in my zip and boom there was the best offers right in my view .
positive	i accidentally found ukhairdressers . com by_accident whilst_searching for a product to help keep my red hair vibrant in between salon visits .
positive	now that i have i '_ll never look back !
positive	they have the best range of products from the best brands all in one place .
positive	they also offer the best prices and are a far far cheaper alternative to buying your products direct from the salon ( thank_god !)
positive	and then to top it all off , the postage is free ( wow !!)
positive	and my product arrived practically the next_day - what excellent service .
positive	would highly_recommend this website to all of my friends and family .
positive	this is my 0rd time ordering from proworld .

positive	i googled them and sure enough , i found their site .
positive	after a few_minutes into browsing the site , i decided to try out their green_tea since it is one of the safest products available for weight_loss and nowadays everyone seems to be using it .
positive	i was not exactly expecting great results but it worked for me .
positive	not only did i lose 0 . 0 pounds in the first two_weeks , more_importantly it made me much more alert and energetic which is a big thing for a mother of 0 young kids .
positive	since the product was moderately priced it was perfect for a trial and when it worked for me , i also introduced my husband to it .
positive	once he had lost a few measly pounds , he took the big plunge and decided he would go head - on into dieting and muscle building so that his flab can once again faintly resemble a stomach .
positive	accordingly , he is planning to order few muscle building supplements once he has lost some more weight and settled into a good gym routine .
positive	we also tried their fat_burner which was on a special_offer .
positive	though it did not suit me much since my digestive_system could not take it , my husband found it to be extremely effective .
positive	me ?
positive	i am happy with the slow and steady green_tea and would recommend sports food products to anyone_who is looking to lose_weight .
positive	their website is easy to browse and their selection of products just perfect – not too few , yet not so many that you get lost in the details .

positive	* this review is in reference to the " blue_buffalo wilderness grain - free salmon recipe natural revolutionary diet ", which i found on your website 0 months_ago for the low price of $_00 . 00 each , w_/ free s + h . i also received the added incentive of $_00 . 00 off the order when i signed_up for the ' auto - ship ' program .
positive	not only did my first order arrive in lightning - speed time , ( less_than 00_hours from when the order was placed ), it also boasts of a generous ' expiration_date ' of over 0 year '_s time , but i paid far less per bag than even amazon . com has ever offered to me !

positive	" when i met my last rescue pet , dixie , approximately 0 . 0 years_ago , she was a real mess -- both externally and internally .
positive	she exhibited a nervous condition ( g . e . r . d .)
positive	that my vet said was due to her previous horrendous living conditions ; that is to say , that everything that went down her goozle promptly came right back up !
positive	she was painfully emaciated , skeletal almost , and her blood - work was all over the place .
positive	so , after a round of iv fluids and 0 small bags of the ' science_diet ' chow , dixie came home with me to recuperate and to learn how to live in a loving home .
positive	the first thing i did was to research which pet_foods would address her particular condition ; i knew that i didn_'_t want to keep her on the ' science_diet ' regimen -- it '_s too full of ingredients which i feel don_'_t belong in a proper diet for dogs .
positive	lo ' and behold , i stumbled_upon the " blue_buffalo wilderness " formula for dogs .
positive	it seemed like a good fit , due to all of the proper ratios ( protein / fat ) and is totally " grain - free ".
positive	viola !
positive	the rest , as they say , is history .... 0 . 0 years later , dixie now weighs in at approximately 00 loving , happy pounds of my friendly and well - adjusted best friend ."

positive	i have been a customer of altex now for quite a number of years .

positive	i had wandered the internet looking for a great host at good pricing , after_reading a few forums online about hosting sites , i kept reading so many good things about bluehost that i decided to finally commit to them .
positive	i was never disappointed once with any of their service or addon services such as a dedicated security for my shopping_cart .

positive	the clothes and comfortable , attractive and reasonably_priced .
positive	womanwithin even allows returns if your unhappy a purchase for any reason .

positive	they even have clothing accessories , jewelry and shoes !!!!
positive	yea !
positive	if you want reasonable priced , comfortable clothing in your perfect size make it a point to visit the site .
positive	you can even apply for a womanwithin credit_card !
positive	( again , my poor husband , lol ) their credit_card is also accepted by 0 or 0 other clothing sites online , like romans .

positive	some of the questions were quite sensitive for her to ask , although she must be used to it . we talked through my condition , treatment and recovery and she was able to provide me with a comprehensive and well priced quote .
positive	i think it is very fair of your company to ask for a larger excess only if and when any claim is related to my cancer rather_than put it in a very high up front fee , as i had been quoted by another company .

positive	because i '_m feeding 0 small dogs i don_'_t need shipments that often .
positive	so i had to push back my last shipment like 0 times .
positive	each time i called i was fearful of getting attitude , but not the case at all .
positive	every service rep i spoke with was always very understanding and happy to help me figure_out a schedule that worked for me .
positive	not the company .
positive	that speaks_volumes to me .
positive	i thank my daughter for turning me on to petflow .
positive	mazy & piper thank her too !
positive	!
positive	fast delivery and prossesing .
positive	so glad i found this site !!
positive	!
positive	suntransfers are excellent . they were waiting at the airport on our arrival and also picked us up from our hotel for the return trip . very prompt friendly and helpful drivers . would definetly use them again .
positive	this was my second order form ao .
positive	again a good product , at a great price , delivered on day requested .

positive	i would recommend town_fair tire .
positive	in looking for a joint supplement for my arthritic lab , i found petflow '_s site .
positive	i like that the products are mostly organic and / or natural , and bunny seems to like the taste of the petnaturals supplement i bought ( she hated what i got from the vet ).
positive	the active ingredient is nearly the same and she only needs to take one a day versus 0 or 0 for the vet '_s product .
positive	i am a happy_camper .
positive	the only_suggestion i have is to post the recommended dosage on the web_site so that i could have set_up the autodelivery right_away instead of having to wait_until i got the product to figure_out when i will need more .
positive	i bought ovulation_tests and pregnacy tests the price is amazing for how many you can get the sticks are really small that is all i would say as a down_fall but would rather save_money than have an extra bit of plastic around the stick .
positive	thank_you alot .
positive	well what happened to me is i happen to blow a tire on my right passenger_side of my car that tire happen to take my right passenger parking light when it blew out .
positive	so being the perfectionist that i am i cant go around having my car looking crazy every0 know that i take good care of my car so i went online which was exhausting then eureka parks geek came up with the exact part i needed it was easy to install and the part got here quickly im truly satisfied and i would use them again for my future parts needs .
positive	thank_you parksgeek .

positive	i purchased small tags and coaster .
positive	the only issue i have is that i think the price is way too expensive .
positive	like i said , i was looking for a certain look and i could only find the pattern on this website .
positive	i didn_'_t have time to look further .
positive	this put a big dent in my budget .
positive	i left the times at 00 . 00 for departure and return , and when i noticed - after i had paid - i thought i was going to be charged for my mistake , but one quick phone_call and they put it right there and then and sent me an_email to confirm the times were changed correctly .
positive	well_done !
positive	brilliant treatment for a donut like me !

positive	hi pet_flow is a great place where they care about your pets and the owners , they listen to your every need and respond back quickly when you write to them . also most of what i remember it is free_shipping on their products .
positive	i tried both giftcards . com ( giftcards plural , the better service which i '_m reviewing now ) and giftcard . com ( giftcard singular , aka giftcardlab ) to design the same card .
positive	first , giftcards . com had a lower fee to make a custom gift_card , and offered visa or mastercard ( other site only offered visa ).
positive	more_importantly this site let_me use the wording i wanted - i couldn_'_t use the word ' whiskey ' in the greeting_card via the other service , because of their restrictions on terminology ( in this case , nothing alcohol related was allowed ), even_though ' whiskey ' was part of my username for an online gift exchange ( and therefore necessary to include ).
positive	the other site also would not let_me make any references to how the gift_card would be used ( specifically , i couldn_'_t say it was for a " choose your own date night " using the giftcardlab , but giftcards . com had no problem with it ).
positive	overall , this giftcards . com service was very flexible , easy to use , and i will_definitely use it again .
positive	i love love love this site !!
positive	it '_s my go to site when my kids needs microsoft point and i don_'_t have to leave the house .
positive	how simple is that !!
positive	!
positive	order these merrell walking shoes for my husband to replace the same .
positive	the price was much_cheaper_than elsewhere and with free_postage they were most certainly a bargain .
positive	they came in double quick time too .
positive	i have used blackcircles before and as i was very pleased with the service and the quick delivery , decided to use them again .
positive	i needed my new tyre quickly as i had collided with a huge stone in the highway and had a small tyre on .
positive	wasn_'_t dissappointed ........ it arrived within 0 days !!
positive	!
positive	they promised a price match and 00_% further off if you found a product they were selling cheaper_than them - within one day of sending the email request to inform them that a product i wanted was cheaper on another site , they provided a code back to honour the price match and further 00_%.
positive	speedy_delivery , excellent customer_service - will use again and again for all my baby requirements .
positive	thanks !
positive	it is a pleasure not to have to lug 00_pounds of blue from the store to the truck from the truck to the house .
positive	plus , riley know it '_s for him and just seeing him jump all over the box is a joy .

positive	we live in the north of scotland and i get my order the next_day !
positive	i '_m shocked and impressed every time !
positive	very good out of all of them but a bit_slow on the reloan website is excellent easy to follow
positive	i purchased a toyota tailgate handle , service was fast , product was good quality and good price .
positive	i have recently_purchased a tailgate handle from a different company , and that one is already broken , hence this purchase .
positive	this handle seems a lot sturdier .
positive	i was very impressed by your prompt and efficient delivery service , i received text_messages informing_me what time to within an_hour my delivery would arrive , loved the items when they arrived , reasonable shipping rates , all in all , top_class .
positive	quinn and the team were very good .
positive	the hotel is situated in a very good location .
positive	which ever type of activitiy you ' re after quinn can give you his inside scoop , including the best taxi '_s , tailors , restaurants , etc .
positive	he wants to look after you as his gues .
positive	the rooms were perfect , just what we needed for a great price .
positive	fast , easy and reliable .
positive	i know i '_ll get what i need when i need it .
positive	i am not one to buy merchandise warranties but because some of the items i '_ve purchsed over the last few_years are hand_held devices , used by our kids , i thought the likelihood of these devices getting damaged was very high ; square_trade offers accidental_coverage of the warranties i '_ve purchased , i '_ve had to file a few claims and they have either fixed the item right_away , or paid for it without_any hassles and right_away .
positive	their prices are totally_worth it , especially if you can find a coupon .
positive	i '_ll keep using them for my electronic purchases , especially with christmas right around the corner .
positive	i have often reviewed various_countries and lots of different hotels and resorts through trip_advisor and always found them to be very helpful .
positive	i wouldn_'_t think of going to look on any other site .

positive	equally , at what for me was a very stressful life stage , i felt valued in that they cared enough to take time to fully understand my situation and talk through all the options available , nothing was too much_trouble .
positive	it felt_like having a trusted friend to guide and support me through a difficult life transition .
positive	a truly valuable partnership .
positive	customer no 0000000
positive	have a look at this website - its brilliant
positive	i ordered my oil on sunday_evening and it was delivered on tuesday_morning for no extra_cost .
positive	i always use group ordering as well so received a discount on the original price quoted .
positive	i was delivered the wrong product , however customer_service is excellent and the problem sorted speedily .
positive	use pure_formulas when ordering all your supplements .
positive	it provides the best service and donates part of their profits to vitamin angels .
positive	they prices are outstanding ..
positive	if you find the same product cheaper they will not only match their price but also beat it by 0 %.
positive	this is my first time but i plan on coming_back for more ..
positive	i already than refered six customers an so_far we all are waiting to recieve or products in the mail .. to me there shipping prices are a bit high but when you are recieving the product for a low amount how can you go wrong with that .
positive	i believe that i will recieve the same progress if i went an spend $_00 . 00 on the same product .
positive	i have no_problems with international editions of textbooks and their shipping was quick and easy .
positive	i ' d buy from them again for sure .
positive	the dog_food was the cheapest price i could find and it came in 0 days .
positive	i '_ll definitely order from them again .
positive	i just ordered from sw for the 0th time , and every time they offer value and quick delivery .

positive	i would definitely order from them again !
positive	luna_bazaar called and emailed me to let_me know the item i order was out of stock .
positive	they were so friendly and helpful when i called .
positive	i bought this shoulder_strap for my son who has dislocated his shoulder 0 times now !

positive	!
positive	both myself and my daughter have been buying from select_specs for several_years_now as they are the best value .
positive	very quick delivery too .
positive	i '_ve been coming to tft for years .
positive	i '_ve only had pleasant experiences when visiting the store .
positive	each time i '_ve had issues with my tires i always return because i trust the sales_rep and they are very honest and fair .
positive	even the technicians are wonderful .
positive	i absolutely love every person in this store .
positive	the only issue i have is that i think tft as a company should give the techs that work on the actual cars / trucks air_conditioning in the auto shop / bays .
positive	i was looking at tires in the back of the store and the the tech opened the door and i was horrified when i felt the hot air hit me .
positive	it '_s unfair to make people work in such an environment .
positive	it was 00 + degrees and humid yesterday and even_though they had fans i felt it was wrong to have any person work in such an atmosphere .
positive	it actually infuriated me that a company would treat any employee that way .
positive	all in all i would definitely recommend tft to all my friends and family .
positive	this branch is amazing , the employees are sweet and kind .
positive	even if there is a wait , they make the point to greet you and tell you they will be right with you and apologize for the inconvenience .
positive	just excellent service all around .
positive	great service from the whisky_exchange , always kept me up to date and received my goods within a couple of days , very good secure_packaging ........ i would recommend and i will be using this site again :-)
positive	as i grow older , and my eyes grow dimmer with macular degeneration and cataract formation , the light with which i read becomes all - important .
positive	having a light_fixture that can be positioned at just the angle i need to cast light on whatever i am reading is essential , a nd your lamp delivered just what i was looking for .
positive	i appreciate the ability to adjust the lumens to my needs , as i am in a well - lighted room , and usually dim the lamp considerably .
positive	however , having a more powerful light when i need it , and being_able to focus the light exactly where i need it makes this lamp a great find .
positive	efficient , knowledgeable , reachable by phone (!!!!
positive	), friendly and patient , excellent honest descriptions of parts and easy navigation on site .
positive	what else can you ask for .... maybe , in my case , just that the volvo wheel emblems can be obtained separate from the wheels because i would rather buy them from you .
positive	happy to know you !
positive	i had a flat_tire on sunday and needed to get to work on monday by 0 : 00 a . m .
positive	i was working a double so needed my flat fixed asap .
positive	the tire could not be fixed so i had to purchase a new tire .
positive	it was 0 : 00 a . m .
positive	the transaction was handled swiftly and seamlessly .
positive	i was at my desk in hamden by 0 : 00 .
positive	great job !
positive	i was happy as was my boss .
positive	the service is similar in cost to many off airport car_parks when booked in advance , but the ease of arrival and return is so much_better .
positive	there is nothing to beat having your car ready and waiting for you within a stone '_s throw of the arrival lounge .
positive	i can feel_confident ordering from b_&_h .
positive	they '_ve been around a long time , know their products and give the best value !
positive	i needed a stethoscope for school , this site had the cheapest prices , allowed me to compare models and offered free_engraving .... other_sites were up to $_00 more_expensive and charged extra for engraving .

positive	the only_thing i wish the site would put a full description of what comes with the parts .

positive	moving across country can be a pain in the buttocks .
positive	i will be doing that soon , and since i cannot_afford a moving van i decided that since i have to drive up for some job interviews , i should haul some stuff with me and put it in storage nearby until my moving date .
positive	trying to find a storage_unit with available units and prices was hard to do with no phone book , but sparefoot had everything i needed .
positive	no credit_card was needed and i was able to reserve a unit with no_hassles !

positive	i have used double 0 and always have amazing seats .
positive	tickets always arrive in good time .
positive	i have not ordered labels in a couple of years from this company .
positive	just didn_'_t have a need for them .
positive	i love what i ordered this time again .
positive	the web_site is so easy and simple and shows exactly_what you are ordering .
positive	if a mistake is made it is your fault .
positive	will order again .
positive	the insure & go agent was very helpful , and the price was $_000 lower_than the insurance company my travel_agent used !
positive	however , i don_'_t know what they ' re like if one has a claim .
positive	first time buying from pureformulas . com and thought it was great !
positive	easy website to maneuver , great prices , super_fast free_shipping , and i enjoyed the free_sample they gave_me .
positive	i definitely recommend to check them out !
positive	i suggest price checking though ; i found certain products more_expensive and some that were cheaper .
positive	all of the orders i '_ve placed have been processed immediately and shipped with no_issues .
positive	i would definitely order from them again .
positive	this is an amazing website , i will use it every christmas and birthday .
positive	thank_you !
positive	i was worried_about the toner_cartridge i purchased in that it might not fit the printer but was assured by prompt on - line help that it would .
positive	my purchase was delivered in a few_days and everything fits and works_perfectly .
positive	many_thanks hot_toner .
positive	great product and inexpensive .
positive	definitely would recommend petflow . com .
positive	easy to use , navigable website , good prices , and quick delivery !
positive	i was freaking out because i had to book a flight pretty last_minute and all of the flights i could find were outrageously priced .
positive	skytours was the only site that offered a reasonable flight with a great airline and i couldn_'_t be_happier !
positive	fast shipping , great product !
positive	very satisfied .
positive	will buy again !
positive	thanks .
positive	i have websites on at_least four other_places , and including a fancy thing which cost me way too much money .
positive	none of the others are as successful , or as much fun to do , as the simplesite places .
positive	i now have three of them , and i love them .
positive	building them is a lot of fun , and easy for me , an old lady not much good with a computer .
positive	lover them !

positive	thanks for having in stock what i needed .
positive	easy to use and navigate .
positive	i would recommend to anyone .
positive	despite the explosion in internet shopping some uk companies are reluctant or refuse to deliver outside the uk .
positive	i organise deliveries for my self from companies in britain to my home and formerly business in france .
positive	the idea of using up free space in trucks coming over to france anyway makes so much sense and one reaps the benefits of the a choice of the most economic carrier if there is no hurry and express if urgent .
positive	the web_site is easy to use and the labels and dispatch notes are perfect for the companies sending the goods .
positive	i have recommended this service to other people living both in france and spain and companies thinking of exporting from the uk .
positive	in the mean time if i am quoted more than £_00 for delivery by a company i always check to see if the volumetric and weight parameters will deliver a cheaper delivery using interparcel .
positive	finally the companies i have bought goods from find that by me organising the delivery through interparcel they have less hassle and work .
positive	really tremendous !!
positive	ordering was very easy with no_complications , also they are very
positive	understanding as i was on a time limit for a wedding in the u . k . in june , so i had
positive	to have all my things in france before leaving , bravo to you all ..
positive	thank_you for helping_me and making the process easier .
positive	super_fast service and the price was right !
positive	does it get any better ?
positive	i called last_minute to gather info as to which tire was best for my car .
positive	being female and leery of anything in the auto industry , i shopped_around with the info fair town auto gave_me .
positive	long_story short - their recommendation was spot on and they had the best price !
positive	highly_recommend !
positive	0000 diesel mercedes wagon parts are difficult to find .

positive	whilst looking through a range of hotels in london , there was one which sounded ideal for myself and the family .
positive	before booking it , i had a query , so i phoned the free helpline for advice .
positive	the person that answered my call said that they would ring the hotel to find an answer my question , then call me back .
positive	in a matter of minutes , i had a phone_call back with an answer . very impressed with the speed of reply and looking_forward to a weekend away in london .
positive	my granddaughter needed this book for a course she would study over the christmas break , starting on december 00 .

positive	this is my first time replacing a laptop_screen .
positive	i was worried that i wouldn_'_t get it right , that i ' d order the wrong screen , that i ' d break something , that i ' d get it apart and be unable to get it back together , etc .
positive	first , there '_s no easy way to know the exact model of the screen without taking the screen out .
positive	second , there '_s not necessarily a tutorial video for the exact model of laptop one is dealing_with .
positive	still , with the tools provided by laptopscreen . com , i made a very good guess for the screen model , i watched their video tutorial on a similar laptop model , and was able to bring my dell inspiron 0000 back to life with a beautiful bright new display .
positive	the screen arrived_promptly ; it was well - packaged ; the price was reasonable .
positive	i '_m a happy_camper .
positive	if i ever need another screen , i '_m coming_back to you !
positive	get what you want , and with a minimum order free_shipping ?

positive	the glasses fit well and are just what i needed .
positive	i love yesstyle !!

positive	i recommend yesstyle to the moon and back .
positive	happy shopping !

positive	i spoken whit my friends about ecco_shop and i told him that shopping in yours shoop was pleasure .
positive	i have placed 0 orders with memoryc in the past 0 months .
positive	one is always somewhat_skeptical when dealing_with a new vendor , especially over the internet .
positive	i can '_t say_enough about the exemplary customer_service i received from memoryc .
positive	the first order : i was given a tracking_number and an_approximate delivery date , while following the orders progress i noticed it seemed to be not making any progress , i emailed memoryc ...' hoping ' to get a response ... i received an immediate reply , through the course of several emails it was found out that my order and several others had been lost by shipper .
positive	memoryc immediately sent out a replacement shipment ... as it turned_out the shipper found the missing items , memoryc contacted me again and let_me know that the quickest delivery would be with the original shipment .... the order was delivered within a day of the original delivery date ..... memoryc contacted me after i signed for the package and asked if everything was as it should be ... then gave_me a credit for the freight i had paid on the order .... unbelievable !
positive	second order : no difference than the first order i was given a tracking_# and delivery date ... this time on time - actually ahead of time .
positive	the issue this time was my fault ... i had ordered the wrong memory for my laptop .... i emailed memoryc - they immediately gave_me a rga and helped_me verify that i was ordering the right part #.
positive	as it turns_out , i sent the memory back in a us postal envelope .. somehow the envelope opened during_transit and the memory was lost .... memoryc notified me and sent me a picture of the envelope when they received it .... what could i say at that point .... they said a lot .... they first offered me a voucher for a discount on my next order ... then turned around a few_days_later and give me the credit for the memory .... again unbelievable !
positive	giving me the credit was far and beyond there responsibility ... but very much_appreciated !
positive	in this day and age of ' numbers ' - it is nice to find a company who_cares , and one you can actually contact and get immediate answers and help .
positive	thank_you memoryc ....
positive	i love selectspecs .
positive	it offers the highest_quality glasses at the lowest_prices .

positive	since all my animals come into my house thru the sliding door in the kitchen which is white tile i was constantly mopping until i ordered the dirty_dog door_mat .
positive	i had bought one at a feed_store and paid a small_fortune for it .. thru petflow i was able to order 0 for what i paid for one at the feed_store .

positive	pet_flow is a wonderful place to order cat_food from .
positive	they ' re on time , it '_s fresh , and they keep you posted about any changes in the foods or orders .

positive	i '_m a repeat_customer now !
positive	we have recently_purchased memory_sticks for our company and client use .

positive	we bought our american_style fridge_freezer last_year from currys and it recently broke_down completely .
positive	after offering us a replacement , the same product was not available at the store for over 0_weeks .
positive	my sister recommended ao as their customer_service had been excellent when she ' d bought the wrong dishwasher by mistake .
positive	as soon as our money was refunded , i bought the fridge_freezer from ao and was delighted when i could pick the delivery day ( you cannot do this with currys ).
positive	their customer_service team called me to run through the delivery details , which i thought was very efficient .
positive	i paid £_00 connection fee so they would take the packaging away , install the item and give me a demo .
positive	when they delivered it , all they did was plug it in and advise me to switch it on in 0 hours .
positive	so i felt this was a little_disappointing .
positive	i left feedback about this and their customer_services advisor emailed me immediately apologising and confirming she had refunded the connection fee .
positive	i couldn_'_t_believe it - a company who not only apologised but offered a refund without me properly complaining !
positive	and i still would have recommended ao even if my money hadn_'_t been refunded !
positive	i '_ve been extremely impressed with ao and will_definitely use the company to purchase all appliances in the future .
positive	there aren_'_t many companies that manage to exceed my expectations , but ao honestly did !
positive	easy to navigate .
positive	prompt and correct order .

positive	i will have the transition_lenses put in each pair after my eye appointment / latest exam .

positive	not only does chewy . com carry the brand we were looking for , they have a lot of different products available and offered free_shipping on orders over $_00 ... i would have spent that much had i gone to the local_pet_store anyway !
positive	our order was shipped for free and arrived 0 days after we placed the order .... fantastic service !
positive	will_definitely order again !
positive	great website , very easy to use .
positive	like the fact that they was a rated most_popular for a certain budget , that '_s how i got to chose my model the janome snd0000 .

positive	yesstyle is extremely versatile , very reliable , and reasonably_priced ... especially on shipping !
positive	they ' re usually in my price range as a college_student with only so many funds .
positive	plus they make it easy to find what you ' re looking for , suits , sweatshirts , dresses , frills , studs , skulls , roses , you name it they probably have it !
positive	i also really like the fact that they show models wearing the product and what you see is actually what you ' re buying .
positive	on top of that they usually give you a couple ideas on what to mix and match with the item and i really appreciate that as i prefer to know how my clothes are actually going to fit which is why before yesstyle i was always really skeptical_about purchasing online .
positive	i don_'_t shop from other online stores for clothes or accessories ever , not even u . s . stores , because yesstyle has never let_me down when it comes to their product .
positive	also the shipping is great !
positive	i '_ve ordered from japanese / korean / chinese / thai stores and i can '_t tell you how frustrating it is to buy something and wait nearly 0_weeks and it '_s still not there .
positive	but yesstyle doesn_'_t do that , they tell you when they '_ll be able to ship , and the longest i '_ve seen 0 - 00 days , but you can always narrow your search to " ready to ship " and it '_ll get to you in about 0 - 0 days after order if you pay the 0 . 00 for 0 day shipping .
positive	the longest i '_ve seen is five , but that was once and five days isn_'_t even that bad .
positive	p . s .
positive	the 0 . 00 0 day shipping is highly_recommended , it '_s a couple dollar difference , but if you live in the states , it can take a while before ems finally decides you can whatever you bought .
positive	no fault of yesstyle , that '_s just my personal experience with ems .
positive	tl ; dr they ' re you ' re favorite store even if you haven_'_t shopped with them yet .
positive	one of the easiest and best gadgets to have and use frequently !
positive	les fleurs étaient une surprise qui a fait plaisir au destinataire .

positive	i did a lot of research before i bought my larder_fridge and freezer , the choice of products was far greater than most retailers and i got them at a greater discount because i bought them together and saved £_000_pounds on the next cheapest retailer for the same product , and if i wanted to i could have gone and viewed them in their show room , the service was excellent i was kept_fully_updated on my order given a date and approx time_slot upon ordering and even received a text with the drivers names , and then a further phone_call to say that they where only twenty mins_away on the day of delivery .
positive	fantastic service .

positive	our dog was put on a special_diet because of oxalate stones in his urine .
positive	we were only able to get this food at our vet which wasn_'_t the most convenient ( or reasonable !).
positive	with the petflow program , i know that the next order is on the way before he runs out and i don_'_t have to make a special trip to the vet to pick_up more ( and not having to lug_heavy cases of canned_dog_food is an extra bonus !).

positive	i '_ve booked cars and package deals , and have never been disappointed .

positive	we had a great experience with auto_europe canada .
positive	our car was waiting for us - the only annoying part was having to pay for a second driver - i know this is standard in europe - but after coming_back from california where we could put as many drivers as we wanted for free , it '_s a little frustrating not to at_least be able to put a second driver for free .
positive	the car was brand_new - and unlike us rentals , it did have bells and whistles - ie it gives you an idea what a new car is really like and all the pluses that go with it - for example we did have a gps integrated in the car which was very useful - in the us the cars that are rented are so basic it would never give you any urge to go and buy one - the drop_off at the airport at 0 : 00 a . m . was simple - we assume the final billing will be accurate !
positive	so we had a peugeot 000 - great little car and a terrific holiday .
positive	i love not having to drive 00_miles to get my favorite weight_management dog_food .
positive	i no_longer have to load the heavy_bags into the cart then into the car then into the house .

positive	i received e_- mails and texts to confirm delivery times and my only_criticism is that they said i would receive the laptop on the friday and it came a day early which could have been a problem , but for me was a relief as i had the day off .
positive	the text for the delivery of the ink gave_me a one hour_window and it was delivered within ten_minutes of the start time .

positive	i have to say i am a nervous online shopper , being a recovering technophobe , double nervous when booking to stay in a city i haven_'_t been before , and don_'_t speak the language .
positive	i was under pressure to sort somewhere out and quick , as i wanted to go and see a performance in barcelona .
positive	i had been putting off going on line .
positive	i got on to easy to book , and it is so refreshing when the name of a company reflects the service their name implies accurately , because that was my experance exactly .
positive	something i had put off for three_weeks was over in five minuets ......!
positive	an_email of exactly_what i had got for my money , along with really useful instructions of how to get to my hotel from all options .
positive	traveling_alone this is the sort of thing that gives me a bit of confidence .
positive	it was my first time , booking on line and i will_definitely be useing them again and i would have no_hesitation recommending easytobook . co . uk .
positive	many_thanks .
positive	i am busy planning my next trip in july and will be looking to easytobook to find my accomidation .
positive	i like it .
positive	there are so many options , that if delivery . com weren_'_t easy to use and didn_'_t have the restaurants i wanted , i wouldn_'_t use it !
positive	i found the logo co while performing a search for a logo design company and in the process found all the wonderful reviews they had on trustpilot . com .
positive	as a result of their reviews and portfolio i went_ahead and hired them to design a logo for my llc .
positive	the whole_process was seamless and i couldn_'_t have been more pleased with everyone .
positive	they designed amazing logos for me to choose from with their interpretations of what i described .
positive	interpretation was everything and once i found the right words and sent examples they hit it right on the nose ..... it blew me completely away and made the decision to narrow_down a design difficult , because i loved all of them so much .
positive	i '_m so thankful for their patience in working with me to get the picture i had in mind on paper .
positive	i will certainly use their services in the future and will recommend them to my colleagues .

positive	from help with getting the proper files for a wax seal stamp , troubleshooting with me & adding a trademark symbol to my logo , just to name few things .
positive	each time they were as responsive , prompt , helpful , knowledgeable , & genuinely kind as any other time i '_ve ever needed their assistance .
positive	turn_around time was always within ( 0 ) business day & the work was top_notch . i truly can not say_enough about their customer_service & values .
