negative	i booked a theatre and meal deal through lastminute . com for my girlfriends_birthday .
negative	i didn_'_t pay a lot for the deal so i wasn_'_t expecting much in terms of meal and seats but i was planning to make the most of it all the same .
negative	we arrived for the meal at kitchen italia in covent_garden and were handed a small menu called their " rapido " menu .
negative	the waitress explained that we entitled to a main course from the rapido menu and a glass of house wine or soft drink .
negative	so good so_far , however , 00_minutes after ordering our meals and drinks , nothing had arrived .
negative	then out of nowhere , a small slab of lasagne arrived in front of me , stone cold !!!
negative	i told the waitress who didn_'_t even offer an_apology and took the food away .
negative	meanwhile , my girlfriends macaroni and cheese arrived complete with raw pieces of bacon in it !!!
negative	so again we told the waitress and again no apology and again took the food away .
negative	0 minutes later my lasagne was returned , nuked to an inch of it '_s life and my girlfriends macaroni and cheese minus the raw bacon .
negative	both tasted as bad as they looked and we still hadn_'_t had our drinks .
negative	at this point we decided to leave , without so much as a goodbye from the staff .
negative	before we left i did notice that the meal offered would '_ve cost us £ 0 . 00 each , along with the £_00 theatre_tickets , our so called " deal " should '_ve cost £_00 . 00 ...... i paid £_00 . 00 !!
negative	!
negative	anyway , the seats in the theatre were great and the show was awesome , apart_from the over enthusiastic woman next to me who hit me on the head and in the face several_times , to my girlfriends delight !
negative	!
negative	so to sum_up , lastminute theatre and meal deals aren_'_t deals at all and cost more than face value .
negative	and stay_away from kitchen italia !!!
negative	!
negative	i am been trying to set_up drirect debt for for 0 years every time i try to set_up with them they say that you direct debt is not set_up and they charge you 0 pound for not having direct debt talktalk is so bad would book about how bad they are seriously
negative	yawn !
negative	have you ever been into a currys store lately ?
negative	why not either a ) be jumped upon by the hawking sales staff when you look to be busy looking at something or b ) find nobody in sight when you need assistance ?
negative	don_'_t expect any pleasantries from the branch i had visited , the staff carefully_selected to have no personality or friendly outlook , and yet have been specially trained in rubbing their hands in a miserly manner and grinning eagerly at the till whilst exchanging some unwelcome cheek .
negative	thanks for warning me through this experience , i '_ll make a point of not coming_back !
negative	has your vehicle broken down ?
negative	do you wish to spend a couple of hours trying to explain that you have a breakdown policy with the company through your insurer , that you have a policy number and that they have been taking payments from your bank_account every_month by direct_debit ... and yet , " sorry_sir , you don_'_t appear to be on our system "... expect to speak to several uncaring and incompetent team managers to be told that you ' re stranded ... thanks for the atronomical mobile telephone bill by the way ...
negative	call assist , i '_ve seen cockroaches move faster !
negative	expect being quoted higher_than other_insurers , expect extremely poor customer service and promises from an overseas call_centre when things go_wrong , expect to be billed incorrectly without a valid explanation , expect to receive no response when you complain , expect to be referred to a debt_collection_agency should you even require clarification of your bill , expect a face - less and human - less organisation to railroad you into paying something you don_'_t actually owe ... they want your money and that '_s all !
negative	do you want an insurance company that rips you off and fails to deliver on any of its promises and then blames other associated companies when things go_wrong ?!
negative	then this is the company for you !
negative	incompetent at dealing_with enquiries , administration , billing , breakdown_cover ( enjoy being left_stranded ), complaints , customer service ... its probably best just to say " stay well clear "...
negative	i have never had the worst dealings with a company in my entire life !
negative	bt has_been grossly incompetent in trying to deal with technical_issues with a broadband_connection , with a technical_team based overseas that had no idea of how to fix things but would promise you the earth !
negative	the service itself was totally_unreliable and costly compared with other telephone and broadband providers ... and they like to lock you into a 00 months contract !
negative	don_'_t do it !!
negative	our ordeal went on weeks and then bt had the bare - faced cheek to offer a pithy £ 0 . 00 in compensation .
negative	so , if you like to be onto their " care " team for hours at a time , get nowhere , suffer a poor and expensive service , and get insulted with the compensation you are offered , then bt is the best choice for you !
negative	my advice , stay well clear !
negative	i bought two_sets of spes , one of which was a framed set of glasses .
negative	they were delivered quickly but found bent , warped and misaligned when opened .
negative	following a complaint i returned the set for repair and they we returned still warped , bent with an added damage to the lens section .
negative	they are unusable .
negative	utterly poor and frankly i will now think_twice about ever buying again .
negative	unable to track my order via the website as the order number given says invalid ..
negative	fingers_crossed i guess that product arrives
negative	we shop at iceland most weeks and while its not m & s you do usually get good food for the price you pay with a good variety .
negative	however today i bought iceland kebab meat (£ 0 ) in our local_store , and some pittas and salad and foolishly thought it might be as it appears on the pack .
negative	this stuff , it turns_out , is mechanically separated and when microwaved as per the guidelines , is a battleship grey , slimy , jigsaw of various shapes including half circles .
negative	it looked horrific but smelt ok so i put it under the grill as i thought our microwave was on the way out .
negative	one bite of this crap makes you wish you had spent your £ 0 on a cup of tea for a tramp .
negative	i refused to let my kids near it - seriously , truly disgusting .
negative	availability of products does not agree with the information provided on site .
negative	information about delivery is incomplete or missing .
negative	your customer service did not answer completely or accurately to my questions .
negative	my credit_card was debited even without_any goods being sent .
negative	that is not the practice with other web shops that charge you only when goods are shipped .
negative	although i cancelled my order in due time more than one week_later my credit_card is still being charged !!!
negative	!
negative	i spent £_00 on a valentines package for my wife .
negative	i sent the order well before the day , but to my outrage nothing arrived by 0pm on the day !!
negative	i tried various links , and calls to moonpig , to no_avail .
negative	the package finally arrived half - way through the next_day , and when opened , to say we were both disappointed is putting it mildly .
negative	there was a rose ' plant ', which was weathered , had only two flowers left on it ( the remainder were in the bottom of the package !
negative	), a few chocolates , the card , basket which did not fit the plant but looked rather obscure , 0 bar 0of soap , and a pot pourri !
negative	also there were 0 leaflets , 0 displaying how to care for the rose , and one about caring for an orchid ???
negative	?
negative	for the outlay of £_00 , i consider this to be well below standard , and i will_definitely think_twice before using moonpig again !
negative	moved_into a house that was served by these fools end of jan , called to setup new account .
negative	provided all details , dd , name , address , reading but they have been unable to setup my account three_months later .
negative	better still they have started sending threatening_letters demanding payment of ' the bill ' despite my contacting them on numerous_occasions trying to sort_out the mess .
negative	i have given readings but they are still unable to send anything but an estimated ( way over ) bill to ' owner occupier '.
negative	now they are threatening to hand my account ( what account ) over to a collection company , again despite the fact i have called them to sort_out this mess .
negative	i now have the pleasure of spending the next 00_mins on hold but when i finally get through i '_m not going to be mr nice guy .
negative	this company are the most useless set of idiots i have even had the displeasure of dealing_with and i hope to be rid of them asap .
negative	avoid at all costs .
negative	i had the hd package with sky plus .
negative	after 00 months i cancelled my contract .
negative	the offered me 00_%_off to stay with them .
negative	if they can_afford to give me 00_%_off then it shows how much they are overcharging !
negative	i felt insulted
negative	i can '_t understand_why i have to pay double the face value of a ticket and it not be classed_as ticket touting !
negative	full wired apt .
negative	only had to xfer account .
negative	nothing but trouble .
negative	after 0months i received nothing but bill for a service that was never connected .
negative	also spent approx 00_hours on the phone .
negative	my wife and i ordered a range cooker and a dishwasher from an online company ( not curry '_s ) and we were informed knowhow were going to deliver it .
negative	they supplied us with text_messages to say they would be delivering it but no reference_number should we need it .
negative	we had a text on the day of delivery to say it would arrive but no time .
negative	i took the opportunity to disconnect our old cooker and stick it in the garden .
negative	at 0pm we were called but missed it .
negative	an answerphone_message said the delivery could not come today as they were having trouble with their trailers and we should call them back on the number supplied .
negative	easier said than done .
negative	the usual loads of options followed_by endless minutes of waiting .
negative	the person_who answered could not help us because we did not have a reference_number and they said they would get the person_who left the message to call us .
negative	she did not .
negative	we had to call her and again had to endure the wait .
negative	we were told that the delivery would be rescheduled for the next_day .
negative	no real apology or regret was conveyed to us .
negative	i was fuming and asked what sort of compensation we could expect because we had nothing to cook on and also had a lodger who would not be able to prepare meals either .
negative	i asked for £_00 which i thought a reasonable and not extortionate_amount .
negative	i was told £_00 was all they could go to .
negative	pathetic response from a pathetic company
negative	the difference ... wiggle sales are terrific , prompt and well handled .
negative	wiggle returns extremely poor , lack of direct communication , unavailable for contact except email or online_chat which is very fragmented .
negative	purchased new wheels (£_000 ) from wiggle unfortunately though incorrect item ordered - accept this was my fault .
negative	contacted wiggle regarding returning item for correct i . e .
negative	:- replacement .
negative	used online_chat - requested photo of item ( to check item not damaged ) understandable .
negative	no reply for wiggle for a week !
negative	multiple emails sent including a complaint email to sales , regarding lack of reply .
negative	finally a reply , for items in box bigger than 00x00x00 there is no free returns_policy , for to arrange_collection £_00 to be paid .
negative	my reply was simple , due to lack of communication for over a week as a sign of good faith to a gold member could you waive the collection fee and exchange items when new set of wheels delivered .
negative	no reply !
negative	!
negative	again sent a complaint due to lack of contact - back on instant_chat .
negative	i can '_t process your complaint as only available for monday - friday 0000 - 0000 .
negative	( this was a sunday )
negative	we have placed a top priority and agent will call you to numbers provided .
negative	again , no reply !
negative	!
negative	waited for call back in morning , nothing > get an email_saying could you reply with suitable time to call you .
negative	replied again > i have already left my details numerous_times with your department , i was expecting a call today , i am available now for contact on numbers provided .
negative	no reply again !
negative	so here i am with no direct customer service numbers to speak to anyone , one department clearly not talking to the other .
negative	i don_'_t know where to go !!
negative	!
negative	i only want to exchange wheels for correct item .
negative	it will be 0_weeks from wheels delivered and no action has taken place !
negative	extremely let_down by a company that i always recommended to people to use , left to wonder should i be shopping at cycle surgery , evans , etc where at_least i can talk to a person for the more_expensive items .
negative	terrible lack of respect shown to customer to not reply .
negative	bravofly booked our car_hire for a recent_trip to dublin and i paid extra for a collision_damage_waiver .
negative	when i got to dublin_airport i was charged extra for collision_damage_waiver and was basically told it was not worth the paper it was written on .
negative	would not use again .
negative	i hired a car through their website called carhire0000 .
negative	the car_hire company hertz would not let_me have the car as they claimed i was not on the electoral role .
negative	i am and i voted in may .
negative	however this is not the problem .
negative	the problem is that the traveljigsaw website carhire0000 will not refund me .
negative	i had no service from them .
negative	it has_been a month and they still have my money .
negative	the website did not tell me a credit_card would be required .
negative	after paying and completing my booking ( by debit_card ) i was told a credit_card would be required .
negative	i rang up and had this confirmed by a member of staff .
negative	since i do not have a credit_card i asked to cancel the booking and have a refund .
negative	i was told i was not allowed a refund .
negative	i had to work had to persuade the staff_member to let_me speak to a manager .
negative	he said someone would call me back .
negative	they did not .
negative	i rang up again an_hour later and spoke to a different member of staff .
negative	this time i was told i would not need a credit_card too pick_up the car .
negative	i went_ahead with the booking .
negative	however , on picking_up the car from hertz i was told i was not on the electoral role so could not take the car .
negative	i voted in may 0000 and am on the electoral role .
negative	i rang up hertz for a refund but they cannot help .
negative	i was charged by carhire0000 on 00th_november and have yet to receive a refund .
negative	make_sure you are on the electoral register if you plan on hiring a car .
negative	they don_'_t tell you this is a requirement before collection .
negative	no refund yet .
negative	total timewasters .
negative	they lure you in with a low price then make you view add on after add on until the price is 00 times what you expect .
negative	don_'_t bother with them .
negative	ordered last_week and paid extra for 0 day delivery .
negative	we are now 0 days on and items still not arrived .
negative	customer service line has now been engaged for over 0 hour as my auto dial service redials every 0 mins .
negative	the ' on - line tracking ' doesn_'_t even give any clues .
negative	discusting service .
negative	on calling and discussing with paypal they adised me they had recieved numerous_calls regarding escapade today !
negative	!
negative	didn_'_t come with the 0 free_samples i ordered .
negative	peanut_butter not as nice as other_companies .
negative	will go_elsewhere nextime
negative	customer service is is a misnomer , no interest in service or facts .
negative	every email ends ' we consider this matter closed ', and if you provide reqired proof they just stop replying
negative	ordered an ipod_nano 0st generation , received an ipod mini .
negative	awful .
negative	well not strictly true the hollyhocks lasted two_days and the roses never made to to the end of day 0 .
negative	so i don_'_t know how skiddle compares with other similar services on this front , but paying £ 0 . 00 for a £_00 ticket leaves a taste in my mouth akin to a 0 - day old grilled stoat .
negative	do not like .
negative	poor dropoff - upon return car had puncture undoubtedly caused_by the surface of the parking_area - crushed builders rubble .
negative	staff claimed to be unable to remove wheel_nuts to change wheel but when i arrived at 0am miraculously all nuts came off easily .
negative	poor service , lied to by staff , appalling conditions at car storage .
negative	i would recommend not to use this company in future .
negative	very unhappy that a company refuses refunds
negative	since buying a case of wine , we have been plagued with calls - as many as 0 a week - from these_people .
negative	we have requested to be removed from their calling list but still they continue to hassle us .
negative	awful customer service , buy your wine elsewhere .
negative	wsate of space , i have spent_thousands with dabs over the years , went over to amazon because of a minor_issue years_ago because amazon customer_support is great , made a mistake and bought a new htc m0 from dams , showed as in stock for next_day delivery , still_waiting 0 days_later , tried to cancel order before despatched as i am supposed to be able to , 00_hours before despatch could not cancel order .
negative	waste of time , should have used amazon or walked to the shop , will not use again , do not recommend .
negative	changed my flight , breached own t &_cs and refused a refund .
negative	ruined my holiday .
negative	have filed a charge back with my credit_card provider as they refused to cancel the ticket despite their own terms and conditions stating that they would if they had to change the flight on me .
negative	think_twice before booking with them .
negative	my vehicle was delivered on the expected date only to find it was the wrong_colour and not what i had ordered !
negative	the car was taken_away and i have been left without a vehicle for a further 0_weeks before a new delivery , as i had sold my previous car the day before .
negative	nobody in authority was available to speak to me and i was promised a phone_call back on monday .
negative	no call from nationwide so i had to chase to find out what was happening .
negative	i have now been offered an_alternative colour which is not acceptable .
negative	i '_m awaiting a refund on my administration_charge as promised and will be ordering elsewhere .
negative	no confidence in this company .
negative	they do not ship , they stall , they keep emailing dispatch notes but no goods arrive .
negative	i do not believe there is an office at the published address i think calls are handled at a home
negative	this site attacts visitors because of its low_prices , it passes you through to amazon and earns affliate commissions on anything you subsequesntly buy - on amazon_marketplace .
negative	emailed company a picture of item i wanted to purchase .
negative	i have called them 0 times in that month , each time someone promising to call me back , but no ever did .
negative	when i called in to complain , the adviser refused to give me the managers number and hanged up on me .
negative	delivered late - on valentine '_s day .
negative	never answered the phone to respond to query .
negative	never responded to e_- mail for 0 - 0 days , and even then never understaood the issue of delivering so late in the day .
negative	i have been trying to get a refund on the 00 day terms of refund . customer service is hopless . and unhelpfullhave been misinformed about returning item to store . for refund . not straight_forward as led to belive wasted hours going back to store to get this refund , still trying
negative	paid for one month license expecting a good outcome to help me thrive in fifa_coins , however the complete_opposite occurred , the told me programming errors had occurred upon several_occasions causing me to lose all of my fifa_coins with no compensation because i didn_'_t look at their facebook_page due to being in school .
negative	you will never get a reliable service from this company
negative	don_'_t use this service , id recommend look at other bots .
negative	a place where the malicious can do serious damage to people '_s businesses without either proving who they are , what their motive is etc .
negative	the sooner this is cleared off the world wide web and people start honestly using reputable sites like trustpilot the better .
negative	pissedconsumer . com is on a par with some seedy sex sites , or other such highly obnoxious internet experiences .
negative	where '_s trading_standards when you need them - this company needs removing from the internet so no one can place any further orders with them as they are clearly not honouring them but pocketing the cash .
negative	i am in dispute with them via barclaycard for £_000 where they took my money when the goods were discontinued and have not refunded after multiple attempts / methods of engagement .
negative	does anyone know the owner '_s details to bombard him with complaints ?
negative	so let '_s say your trusty big freezer is finally giving up after 00 years and as it '_s warm out there you need a replacement quickly .
negative	having seen the ao . com adverts about speedy delivery i searched out the one i needed on their site and found it just as competitively_priced as elsewhere .
negative	and the real_bonus was a free next_day delivery slot !
negative	i duly ordered and paid and rearranged my day accordingly .
negative	email confirmation of the order followed shortly with information_regarding delivery times to be given after 0 am the next_morning .
negative	indeed having checked my emails after 0 i was delighted to find delivery scheduled for 00 . 00 to 00 . 00 .
negative	great , i '_ll work my day around that .
negative	then it all went wrong .
negative	at 0 . 00 i received a call saying the new freezer was not actually in stock and that the earliest delivery now would be 0 days_later !.
negative	thanks , i was going out that day which i '_ve now had to cancel .
negative	so much for ' delivery when you want , when you ' re in '.
negative	how about ao . com checking they '_ve got the stock first before taking your money and promising a delivery date .
negative	have you ever come_across a website that not only looks as though it was created 00 years_ago but also works like it ?
negative	well , try the companies house website .
negative	what a dinosaur !.
negative	it looks awful and it doesn_'_t work .
negative	they still think we all use internet_explorer !
negative	got a query ?
negative	then go to the help menu .
negative	( no help by phone available outside office hours of course ).
negative	bit of a shame but it '_s written in the equivalent of mandarin chinese .
negative	still_waiting for my download so i think i '_ll just go to a proper site for some company info .
negative	like all insurance companies they are really evil incarnate .
negative	but that '_s just my opinion so consider the following scenario :
negative	let '_s say you have a worrying medical problem so you go to see your gp .
negative	he / she says you need to be investigated further urgently by a specialist .
negative	as you have medical insurance you are able to make an appointment with a chosen specialist .
negative	he / she instigates tests , scans , mri '_s etc .
negative	the prognosis is that you ' re ok at the moment but need to be monitored closely to ensure that nothing sinister develops .
negative	and here '_s where it all falls_apart .
negative	to your gp you ' re now ' under the care ' of a specialist consultant so observation / monitoring is not their problem .
negative	believe me , they wont be contacting you .
negative	but as simplyhealth only consider paying out for a worsening of a condition or new symptoms , not regular observation / tests / monitoring / follow_up appointments , how are you being looked after ?
negative	answer , you ' re not because simplyhealth only operate reactively , not proactively .
negative	and for what it '_s worth , having been a member of simplyheath in a company scheme , when i left that employment i wanted to continue my health care unbroken i found that my loyalty was rewarded by increased premiums far more than joining new from scratch !
negative	thanks .
negative	and to give you some figures the premiums now are around £ 00000 per year for myself , my wife and one daughter .
negative	or we can get that down to around £ 0000 a year by accepting a £_000 excess each .
negative	meanwhile this year simplyhealth have just taken_away their foreign travel protection ( just because they can ).
negative	why_bother with them ?
negative	so , we know the bank of england rate has_been at 0 . 0 % for the last 0 years .
negative	not good news for savers admittedly but much_better if you are borrowing .
negative	but it does beg the question as to why santander '_s standard variable rate is 0 . 00_% - that '_s 0 . 00_% above !
negative	!
negative	try phoning the mortgage advice line and ask something like ' what '_s 0 + 0 ?".
negative	well if it '_s not on their script , how could they possible answer ?
negative	don_'_t think i '_ll go near them with a barge_pole .
negative	take a look at bmi '_s website should you have a sick child needing a specialist consultation : ' whatever your concerns or needs , you can book an appointment directly as no referral letter is necessary , by phone , fax or email - and there '_s no need to wait ', they say .
negative	well i didn_'_t want to wait , i wanted my daughter to see a consultant urgently .
negative	so i phoned for that appointment - only to be told that they will in fact not make one without a referral from our gp .
negative	and since it takes around 00 days to get a gp appointment it kind of all defeats the object really !
negative	iflo is travis perkins own_brand for showers etc .
negative	take a look at their literature and you '_ll see plenty of wording about guarantees .
negative	but interestingly there is no phone number to call , no email address and no postal_address .
negative	so how do you make a claim for some faulty materials ?
negative	well you are supposed to go to the branch of purchase where it will all be sorted_out for you - not .
negative	branches are staffed by not very bright sale people who have absolutely no interest in helping you .
negative	of course i '_ve only visited the branch twice , called 0 times and having eventually found a head_office address called them 0 times .
negative	perhaps i '_m not working hard enough !
negative	oh , and my plumber thinks the products are rubbish anyway .
negative	having ordered a currys dishwasher i called to see about the delivery as i hadn_'_t been given a date after a week .
negative	well it only took 00_minutes before the phone was answered !
negative	and having paid the extra £_00 for installation and arranged with a colleague to receive delivery as i could be present all day myself the delivery person said they couldn_'_t remove old washer or install new one as the water wasn_'_t turned off .
negative	over the phone i said you can turn the tap off to shut the water off but ' we ' re not allowed to do that " was the reply .
negative	the website advertises dispatch same day , delivery next_day . you have the option of paying by credit_card or paypal .
negative	as i have a paypal_account this was my choice .
negative	however next_day came and no delivery .
negative	an online check at watch shop revealed no dispatch .
negative	' why is that ?
negative	', i emailed and ' phoned watch shop .
negative	answer : ' they are waiting for manual verification which can take 00_hours !'
negative	so having checked my paypal_account to find that the payment had in fact indeed been taken i spoke to paypal who could not understand_why the goods were not dispatched and therefore raised a dispute accordingly .
negative	we '_ll see what happens now but fortunately i '_m near enough to watch shop to visit in person if needed !
negative	and i was just about to make another purchase .
negative	so watch_hut next time ( but i '_ll check reviews first !).
negative	update_: received an email next_day - my order cancelled by watch shop with no explanation !
negative	i ' d had my phone a month and decided to get a different one , was going to sell on e_bay , but after charges etc the price offered by these seemed very reasonable .
negative	then to my shock i received an e_mail_stating problems found with the order and they wanted to pay me a lot less for my mobile .
negative	( which is in mint_condition , withought a single mark .)
negative	i called them up to enquire as to what the problem was , the girl checks computer ... and the engineer ?
negative	states there are scratches on the screen and back of device , so i kick up a stink because i have photographic_evidence that the phone is in excellent like new condition .
negative	then they can suddenly ( nearly ) meet my original quoted price .
negative	so i accept so i dont risk receiving a phone that they would have to scratch themselves
negative	i have sent over 0 emails regarding my bills and yet to have my billing rectified .
negative	0nd february_0000 and no bills provided since october_0000 a total_lack of support and no way to run a company , i have tried everything to sort this issue but no help from the company .
negative	now seeking_legal_advice totally fed_up
negative	i would never recommend buying from this company - and i wish i had '_ve read more reviews before i did !
negative	i ordered some headphones and were told they were in stock and would be delivered within 0 days - and the money was taken from my credit_card immediately .
negative	when there was no sign of them i contacted wae plus who told me they ' d be another 0 - 0 days .
negative	having read some reviews about their practices by now , i decided to cancel immediately .
negative	they said they ' d process the cancellation no problem , but i am still_waiting for the refund four weeks_later !
negative	i '_ve now had to process it through my credit_card as a disputed item .
negative	i would never recommend this company and i will never buy from them again .
negative	they can keep the £ 0 they used to incentivised me to write this review !
negative	i was phoned by cpw as i approached my upgrade date .
negative	i agreed to get an iphone 0 , but was told unequivocally that i had 00 days to return it to any cpw shop if i changed my mind .
negative	i received the phone quickly the next_day ( no problem there ), but soon realised it wasn_'_t the phone for me .
negative	so i took it back to a cpw shop , where the trouble began .
negative	the assistant refuses point_blank to accept it , even when i ' d said his own customer_services had said i could return it .
negative	i went next door to the o0 shop , where they were unbelievably helpful .
negative	they phoned cpw customer_services for me , then physically walked next door with me to cpw to sort it out .
negative	it was eventually only when the cpw shop assistant had his own customer_services on the end of my phone giving him instructions that he would take back the phone and refund me - and then only reluctantly and with very bad temper .
negative	only later did i discover , however , that he didn_'_t note the return of the phone on his system , meaning that when , in the o0 shop , they tried to sort me out a very favourable deal because of the trouble i ' d had next door , they couldn_'_t .
negative	it took several days to sort_out .
negative	so 000_% score to o0 in headingley , leeds , for their very great care and attention in sorting it out for me , and in great contrast about 0 % to cpw in headingley for their incompetent , verging on rude and insulting , service .
negative	i know where i '_ll go in future .
negative	alpharooms sux , i booked a hotel that was advertised with room facilities eg , air_conditioning , sea vew , cable tv and fridge .
negative	yes those facilities were there but had to pay extra for each facilies when we arrived .
negative	the transfer they arranged kept us waiting 0 hours at 0am in turkey at the airport .
negative	the customer service is very poor and arrogant .
negative	first and last holiday with alpharooms .
negative	i ( stupidly ) sent my 00gb iphone_0s to this " company " to repair a stiff power_button .
negative	other than that it worked_perfectly .
negative	it came back a month later and would no_longer work at all .
negative	rang them ... they claimed that '_s how they received it .
negative	i ' d spoken to them on 0 occasions chasing it and they never mentioned anything_else wrong with the phone and were clearly incorrect .
negative	they told me they had photo '_s proving the additional fault - have been to trading_standards and asked them repairs 0 to prove etc and they have since stopped_replying .
negative	have just filed with small_claims court .
negative	repairs 0 normally ask trust_pilot to remove these negative_reviews claiming they are not from real customers .
negative	my name is michael j pope and trust me !
negative	i am a real customer
negative	i have since taken this " company " to the small_claims court .
negative	they have not responded and i am requesting judgement against them .
negative	for your own sake do not use this company and make_sure you tell as many people as you can so no one else gets conned by them .
negative	ordered a bass speaker with email on 00 june saying it will be with you next working day .
negative	it wasn_'_t and then was a way from home for a week .
negative	on return still no delivery .
negative	phoned up to be told it was delivered and fedex have a signature , but no one we know has that name including neighbours .
negative	meanwhile the event its needed for is in 0 days and proaudio won_'_t send another unless i reorder and pay again .
negative	i might get my money back if fedex can find out where its gone , but maybe i won_'_t .
negative	be very careful or setting from these_people - not much customer_care is on offer if the order gets lost .
negative	just as before 00 days for delivery what a joke !
negative	!
negative	what a pointless delivery company .
negative	cannot find my address even_though we live in a major city eg manchester !
negative	just spoke to oliver at customer_services who confirmed they do not provide sat_navs as a company .
negative	well maybe they should .
negative	here '_s to a day taken off work for nothing .
negative	thanks guys .
negative	i caught the delivery man peeing in front_door of flars 0 ! weeks before and i was upset with him for that , he started , to abuse me instead for saying sorry , i wrote to the company about this issue got no reply and no action was taken
negative	this saturday i met same delivery man , he said to me that he is gonna hit me once he finishes delivering , i simply called police and this delivery man disappeared quickly , i need to file proper complain in police_station as the company doesnt care , so be carefull
negative	purcashed a item from this company and it came without a power_cable and was a different part number then what was advertised .
negative	due to christmas we were unable to unpack the package until around a month after it had been delivered but thier approach was that they accused us of both switching the item and refused to refund .
negative	lesson_learnt you pay a cheap price and you get a cheap level of service .
negative	i subscribed to lovefilm for quite a while , despite not really using the service to it '_s fullest .
negative	the instant_streaming is poor ( netflix is far_superior ), the way they send low priority list fillers over the new stuff is irritating , but the worst aspect is what happens when you try and cancel .
negative	i cancelled with them in february .
negative	they are still taking payments from me , despite the customer_services team claiming they aren_'_t .
negative	as it '_s on a continuous payment basis , even changing my debit_card hasn_'_t helped as " they don_'_t need all the details " ( quote direct from barclays ).
negative	it seems that once they have your details , they are going to keep taking money whether you are an active subscriber or not .
negative	essentially , they are stealing my money .
negative	so_far , i '_ve spent hours on the phone to various lovefilm departments .
negative	they seem to be based in a country with a thick accent and little understanding of english , judging from the number of times i '_ve had to ask for clarification or had to repeat what i '_ve said .
negative	frustrating !
negative	i '_ve finally resorted to emailing lovefilm '_s operations director , fern o ' sullivan ( fern . osullivan @ lovefilm . com ) directly in the hope that she can pass my complaint on to someone that can sort the problem out .
negative	judging from their track_record so_far , i '_m not holding my breath .
negative	i '_ll update this when they respond , however .
negative	avoid .
negative	i sent my iphone_0s to them with a broken screen .
negative	when i placed the order , i chose to also replace the rear glass and to change both to white ( something i verified was ok by email before placing the order - got a strangely quick response to that enquiry ).
negative	i even paid extra for ' guaranteed same day service '.
negative	sent the phone to rotten_apples on the thursday i placed my order and assumed that it would be back in my hands by monday at the latest , allowing for the weekend .
negative	the weekend came and went , monday came and went , no sign of my phone and no sign of any contact from rotten_apples either .
negative	i used the ' live_chat ' facility on their website to find out where it was and was told that there had been a problem but the screens had been replaced and it was now on it '_s way back .
negative	i was given a tracking_number .
negative	tuesday arrived and the tracking_number didn_'_t work .
negative	wednesday , same deal - tracking_number didn_'_t work .
negative	i rang them this time and was told that the technicians were out but someone would call me back within an_hour .
negative	two hours_later , i called them again .
negative	this time i was told that the guy would find out what was happening and would call me back himself .
negative	he eventually did and told me that the phone had developed a fault and they ' d had to take it apart to fix it .
negative	as the phone had been working_perfectly for almost three_months with a broken screen , i can only_assume the ' fault ' was either due to a poor repair or an excuse because they ' d_forgotten to actually fix the phone .
negative	i got a hearty apology and the guy offered a partial_refund as i ' d paid for next_day service and hadn_'_t got it .
negative	i '_m still_waiting for any sort of refund .
negative	the phone eventually arrived back on friday , over a week since sending it off .
negative	now , normally , this would be acceptable service - but not after paying extra for same day turnaround , and not after having to chase the company almost every day to get answers on where it was .
negative	i opened the jiffy_bag and slipped out my shiny white iphone .
negative	running my thumb across the home button , i noticed the first problem - it didn_'_t fit_properly .
negative	it is slightly small in the hole and consequently moves just enough to be annoying .
negative	it also isn_'_t flush , like it used to be ( and like my other iphone is ), it is very slightly_higher_than the surrounding glass .
negative	ok , not the end of the world .
negative	as i looked at it closer however , i realised that the thin_plastic bevel around the glass was chipped and scored in places .
negative	i assume from clumsy installation .
negative	flipping it over gave_me the biggest shock however - the back glass has a pair of lovely big scratches , right through the mirrored apple logo so they stick out like a pair of sore testicles .
negative	tilting the phone around in the light showed up plenty more scratches too .
negative	the back , same as the front , also has a chipped and scored plastic bevel .
negative	this severely annoyed me .
negative	i '_m going to have a guess here ; i assume rotten_apples were out of white backs and so recycled one from another phone - meaning i '_ve paid for a used product that '_s in worse condition than the one i sent in .
negative	i assume the poor fitment of the home button is down to crappy chinese parts , something i specifically_asked about before ordering and was assured that they use the same quality parts that apple do .
negative	they don_'_t .
negative	naturally , i sent an email immediately , highlighting these points and asking for a partial_refund or a smaller partial_refund plus a new back .
negative	there '_s no way i '_m sending my phone off to them again , i ' d rather visit the local phone repair shop , something i should have done in the first place .
negative	that was over a week_ago and i have had no reply as yet .
negative	i '_m not holding my breath - the number their 0000 number forwards to has_been disconnected , and the live_chat remains offline at all hours .
negative	so , with no way of contacting them , my only recourse is to plaster the internet in warnings in the hope that if anyone_else uses them , they can expect to be lied to throughout and supplied with shoddy quality repairs .
negative	if they ' d called me the day they received the phone and told me they ' d run out of stock and were waiting for more to come in , i wouldn_'_t have had a problem and would have been happy for them to hang on to the phone until they could repair it to the standard i paid for .
negative	instead , i had to chase and chase to get a string of excuses .
negative	if you need to get your phone repaired , you could take a chance and use rotten_apples ( after all , they have got plenty of good reviews so they obviously get it right sometimes ), or you could go to a local shop where you can hand your expensive tech over in person and ask someone face to face if it isn_'_t ready when expected .
negative	they ' re not even cheaper !
negative	avoid .
negative	update_: within an_hour of posting this , ben from rotten_apples rang me to apologise ( apparently they ' re moving premises and it '_s affected their service ) and offer a full_refund .
negative	i wasn_'_t after a full_refund , rather a phone that i was happy with - so he '_s offered to take it back and redo it once they '_ve completed moving premises .
negative	i '_ll update again once that '_s happened .
negative	update 0 : months later , i '_ve had no more contact from rotten_apples .
negative	despite their apparent good intentions , it seems that moving premises was just a convenient excuse to fob me off .
negative	i now wish i hadn_'_t given them the benefit of the doubt and had accepted the refund .
negative	avoid .
negative	i had ordered a new galaxy_s0 three_days ago , no phone as yet , i have e_mailed them on 0 occasions no reply , i tried_phoning the 0000 number , on hold for 00_minutes no reply .
negative	i went through nectar for the extra points .
negative	do not use this company .
negative	i have reported them to nectar
negative	never win on this site .
negative	somebody ........ or the boss at ladbrokes ........ is a wealthy person , i never met a winner ........ ever
negative	packed in and forgotten about .
negative	i have recently signed_up for wowcher , as i saw a good deal and thought why not ?
negative	now i know why not , terrible customer service ....
negative	attempted to buy deal , and was informed card was rejected and to re - check details , after doing so , card rejected again .
negative	checked with my bank , money taken twice by wowcher .
negative	once calling them , no help at all , just told my money has_been ring fenced and somebody will contact me back tomorrow , after not recieving a call , try them again .
negative	" customer service deal with this issue , but we can '_t transfer you to them " " sit tight , someone will contact you " still no call , 0 days on .
negative	so funds taken , no product , so_far no refund ( which when i do eventually get , will be 00days or something ).
negative	if a high_street shop took your money and didnt give you what you wanted and said " well you can '_t speak to anyone ".
negative	that would be stealing , it '_s a joke !
negative	funniest thing is , the offer was a limit of 0 per customer , however i '_ve been charged_twice ....... and have nothing to show for it , accept a lower balance on my account .
negative	terrible system , service and company !
negative	won_'_t be using them ever again .
negative	i ordered valentines flowers on 00 / 00 / 00 for my girlfriend that is currently in oz .
negative	by 0pm oz time there was no sign of the flowers ...
negative	i called eflorist , to be told that they have to contact their oz office to find out what the order status is and then get back to me after 00hrs ... t
negative	he occassion had been completely_ruined by now as a ) the ( over priced ) flowers were not delivered , and b ) i had to ask if the " suprise " gift had arrived or a " no one in " delivery card left_behind ... etc .
negative	following my complaint , the flowers were delivered at midnight on 00 / 00 / 00 , waking_up the household .
negative	the flowers delivered did not resemble those in the online picture and half of the stock was dead or dying .
negative	later i received a smug email from eflorist informing that the flowers had been delivered on 00 / 00 /_0000 .
negative	i have complained again and now wait to see what eflorist have to say about this ...
negative	i understand from other posts that they will offer a 00_%_discount ( against what is essentially an over priced product ) but try not to pay , or , if you push for it , a full_refund !
negative	... that they also try not to pay .
negative	in short , don_'_t put your faith in eflorist for special / meaningful occasions ... there is a real chance that they will let you down in more ways than one .
negative	i will not use them again and strongly_recommend others to go_elsewhere .
negative	had been with lovefilm for number of years and whilst the service was not without it '_s problems it did provide good value for money .
negative	it all went south with the takeover of amazon and subsequently i have just cancelled my membership as not wasting anymore money .
negative	i will simply echo the comments already made , rubbish amazon rental service portal , poor turnaround of disks ( lucky to get one movie a week ), far too many recent titles not available , rubbish video_streaming as now 0 / 00 movies are additional_charge etc ...
negative	if i could rate lower_than 0_star i would .
negative	well_done amazon !
negative	traded my near perfect_condition samsung mobile_phone online saying they will " honor the agreed price " then they decided to slash £_00 from the agreed price saying the phone has a big scratch on the screen .
negative	if i asked for my phone back they will probably send me a damaged one or purposely damaged the phone themselves .
negative	they didn_'_t even reply to my e_- mail when i considered legal_action ( advised by my solicitor friend ).
negative	so please avoid using this company in store or online .
negative	order some items paid extra for next_day , 0 days_later my items turned_up , no refund on my next_day delievery charge
negative	no stars , can '_t go into negatives but i would if i could .
negative	the most biased propaganda machine ever , like a chinese water torture the bbc '_s drip drip is fed to the poor audience , who '_s propaganda is it ?
negative	i can '_t bear to listen to the incomplete information that constantly pours from this iniquitous company , they have taken trust that was built up over many_years and have totally abused it .
negative	i would dearly like to know the real motives .
negative	don_'_t believe anything that the bbc puts out , not even the weather report .
negative	listen to as many other news sources that you can and try to redress the totally biased bbc output form your own ideas !.
negative	that one star is only there because the trustpilot will not accept no stars .
negative	ordered flowers a fortnight ago , to be delivered on valentine '_s day .
negative	i ' d used this company last_year and they were fine .
negative	long_story_short , the delivery was not made , nor was i informed that the flowers would not be arriving .
negative	the current delivery status suggests that they might be delivered today , but obviously a valentine '_s bouquet which arrives on the 00th of feb is about as much use as a chocolate_teapot .
negative	seriously disappointed and unable to contact customer_services as all i get is an_automated phone message_stating that the office is closed .
negative	i '_ve demanded my money back in full via_email , and i guess will just have to wait and see if they are honest enough to admit that they '_ve made a massive mistake and will give all these angry customers a refund .
negative	update_: company has offered 00_%_off this and a future order , plus doubled this particular order , but i consider this an insult .
negative	why would twice as many valentine '_s flowers make up for it , when it '_s not valentine '_s day any more ?!
negative	and why would i want to give this company more of my money in the future .
negative	jokers .
negative	ordered the flowers for my wife '_s birthday as i work away , stated next_day delivery .
negative	didnt arrive at all , no call to say why , looked on the site and in the q & a it said if order code is ps ?
negative	for example may be 0 day delivery , didnt state that at the point of order / taking my money , if it did i would of ordered as it missed her_birthday , poor poor poor , never will i use again and will_certainly tell people to avoid .
negative	relating to an order back in 0000 , excuse after excuse for weeks , delivery never came .
negative	requested refund three_times , refund never came !
negative	shortly_after this , had a call from my bank about fraudulent transactions being made using my credit_card_details ... my order with crazycameras was the only time i used that card in a long time , so it was most_likely related to these fraudsters and thieves !
negative	disgusting !
negative	do not use !
negative	as instructed by a camerabox rep .
negative	i returned a canon_camera & associated bundle on 00 / 00 /_0000 , due to them sending me an incorrect order .
negative	i was instructed by them to take the package to the post_office , pay the cost of return postage and enclose the receipt for the cost of postage in the package , and they would refund me in full .
negative	cost of return postage was £_00 . 00 .
negative	when they made the refund it was for the actual cost of the items minus the return postage .
negative	i contacted them via_email and got a reply from a person appertaining to be their returns manager ( some manager he is ) stating there was no receipt for the return postage in the package .
negative	this was a downright lie because i personally put it in to the carton with a letter of explanation .
negative	i then emailed him a copy of the postage receipt and have sent several emails for the attention of this manager , but so_far he has failed to reply to any of them .
negative	i think their customer appreciation stinks and if i could i would rate this company as zero , but unfortunately the lowest score i can give them is a 0 .
negative	i know this company has defrauded me out of £_00 . 00 and will never ever trade with them again .
negative	i would urge any person thinking of buying anything from camerabox to really think again .
negative	there are many far better websites out there who really appreciate your custom .
negative	you have been_warned
negative	ordered two bouquets of which only one arrived .
negative	and for the price charged we could have bought a nicer and larger_bouquet from another retailer and then not had the hassle of them not turning_up .
negative	i won_'_t be using them again or recommending them to any family or friends .
negative	definitely a bitter experience
negative	i paid for this and it was just a bunch of links to other_websites .
negative	the only detailed_information on the site was how to download illegally hacked software .
negative	the information on how to jailbreak the iphone is freely_available on the internet from legitimate companies such as iphone dev team .
negative	customer service was poor and there is misleading information on the website .
negative	i paid £_00 for an immediate unlock which ended_up taking about 0_weeks and only lasted until the next apple update when the exploit used was patched .
negative	time for a new mobile_phone and intomobiles had a good offer for a samsung siii with orange .
negative	placed the order on - line but no e_- mail acknowledging it .
negative	tried e_- mailing the company but everything bounced_back by mailer - daemon - undeliverable quota exceeded .
negative	eventually got through on the 0pence per_minute line and told to re - place order and that would be acknowledged .
negative	did that but again no e_- mail response .
negative	getting a bit_concerned_about a company with my bank / credit_card_details who appear uncontactable so wrote recorded delivery cancelling everything .
negative	next , both orders are confirmed by e_- mail .
negative	another letter sent cancelling .
negative	next an e_- mail cancelling one order and confirming the second .
negative	letters never acknowledged .
negative	e_- mails bounce back .
negative	telephone_calls left on hold for 00_minutes without an answer .
negative	tried sending a message through the returns_form on the website but have no idea if it got through .
negative	phone arrived but delivery refused .
negative	almost two_weeks on and orange send me a letter activating the account and the direct_debit .
negative	orange customer_services worse than useless - even gave_me the wrong number to contact intomobiles .
negative	this has_been the worst on - line buying experience i have ever had .
negative	i would tread with great care if you are thinking of buying through this website .
negative	order placed on 00 / 00 /_0000 : delonghi magnifica esam0000s coffee_machine
negative	received coffee_machine and after a telephone_call with delonghi i was advised to return the item as it was obviously faulty .
negative	i completed the return procedure but was unable to print the voucher .
negative	i have emailed to ask why it is not possible to open the voucher and have received no reply .
negative	today is the 00 . 00 . 0000 - i guess i will not be enjoying a cup of coffee any time soon !
negative	in light of the non_existent customer_care i will not be requesting a replacement but a full_refund .
negative	i will not be purchasing from pixmania in the future .
negative	this is my update .
negative	yes , i am waiting for webcreation_uk to have this negative_feedback removed , how increasingly predictable .
negative	to all those people left with an unfinished website , my commiseratons .
negative	i am in the same position .
negative	however , i can confirm that not only is there an online petition , a government body will now investigate .
negative	so good luck to all you unlucky people who have come in contact with this comapny .
negative	updated review 00 . 00 . 00
negative	this review is from a confirmed client !
negative	invoice number 00000 and invoice number 00000
negative	my full name appears with this review and i am more than happy to share my experience with this dreadful company .
negative	a new low for this company !
negative	updated review 00 . 00 . 00
negative	i confirm that i understand that it is illegal in the uk to write a review about my own business , or to write a review that is false .
negative	are webcreation_uk aware of this ?
negative	my experiences with this company are well_documented along with many many other dissatisfied_customers .
negative	it is a real blow to discover that every negative_feedback listed on this forum against webcreation now states that they are from unconfirmed clients .
negative	surely everyone is aware that before listing feedback all customers must provide invoice numbers .
negative	is this yet another ploy to discredit their unhappy_customers ?
negative	take_responsibility webcreation_uk and stop blaming everyone_else for the amount of online negative_feedback .
negative	i attempted to buy a washing_machine on line , it was imperative that i had it delivered the next_day .
negative	there was no delivery slot available for the next_day so i rang them .
negative	i was told that as the machine was in stock at my local_branch they would deliver it the next_day for £_00 .
negative	i was given a reservation number and told that i had to go into the store to pay .
negative	i arrived at the store was asked if i where taking the washing_machine away with me .
negative	why would i ?
negative	i explained that i had been assured that it would be delivered the next_day .
negative	it was at that point i knew that i was on a hiding to nothing , the sales_assistants expression said it all .
negative	she took me to see her colleague who looked at me and simply said " no chance ".
negative	i was appauld .
negative	i told the assistant that i wished to enter into their complaints_procedure .
negative	she went to see her manager and returned to tell me that i could not register a complaint in - store and had to complain on line .
negative	i thought her response was not acceptable and insisted that i spoke to the manager .
negative	enter ashley .
negative	ashley spend sometime on his computer , failed to get me the delivery slot which i had been promised , and offered me a £_00 discount .
negative	utterly_useless .
negative	i have written a letter of complaint and will never shop there again .
negative	i went on line and bought a washing_machine from a o . com .
negative	they delivered next_day and were first_class .
negative	product was good quality and was as expected as i had previously tried the product on in store .
negative	first delivery attempt ' hermes ' signed for the package in my name and never delivered the product .
negative	when i called customer service they could not understand_why the delivery tracker said ' signed for by household ' and yet i did not have the product .
negative	i felt as if they were insinuating i was not telling the truth .
negative	after 0 days of complains the product was finally resent with a different carrier and arrived .
negative	ordered replament valliant roof brackets and was to be delivered 00th_june .
negative	due to being out of the country i moved it to be delivered on the 00th_june .
negative	on the 00th_june when they were to be shipped for 00th delivery i was called to say the pallet they were on was destroyed / damaged and new ones were being delivered on the 00th_june .
negative	i wonder_why they took 0 days to wait to tell me the goods were damaged and had not re ordered sooner as they should have been in stock from the 00th .
negative	i think a major communications problem between the on line retailer and thier supplier
negative	ok i got the call and i accepted just to get my products on facebook , but only after negotiating £_00 for 0 year .
negative	i called for help with the porduct as what they said was not done .
negative	i was told to " do it yourself ".
negative	sotware is time_consuming and does not do what we need - basically mis_- sold .
negative	now 0yr later recieved a letter wanting a total of £_000 . 00 for 0nd year of contract - now i was never told or aware of this .
negative	basically cheating liars i will not pay and will pursue them in court no problem .
negative	wow , what a poor company .
negative	wish i ' d read posts on here before ordering from them .
negative	0 .
negative	i received no updates on my order , and only when i kept calling when the delivery was overdue did they finally tell me when they would be delivered ... and then it was another week_later .
negative	ordered on 00th_april , delivered on 00th_may .
negative	0 .
negative	i ordered gate fixings ; on the website it says " supplied with a comprehensive set of instructions to help you get started ", however no instructions were included .
negative	i '_m not a gate fitter so some instructions would be nice !
negative	i called buyfencingdirect and was sarcastically told " it '_s not hard , you screw them to the gate "... not very useful and a little rude !
negative	she said she would have to ask the manufacturer for some .
negative	0 .
negative	the ' premier gate fixings ' does not fit the ' contractor featheredge gate '.
negative	the website doesn_'_t tell you what fixings would fit with that gate , which makes_sense as buyfencingdirect sales_dept .
negative	have no idea ... i called and was told " we only sell the gate and fixings , we wouldn_'_t know what goes with what , doesn_'_t the website tell you ?".
negative	unbelievable .
negative	apparently ' after sales ' will call me back within 0 hours ... that was 0 hours and 00_mins ago and nothing so_far
negative	0 .
negative	i have used the ' live_chat ' function to ask about the gate fixings , just to see if anyone would have any idea about what they sell .
negative	after 00_mins of waiting still nobody has answered ... not very ' live '.
negative	0 .
negative	i tried to review the gate fixings on their website to point out they are not sent with instructions , despite them saying they are .
negative	no luck - my post , which was polite with no swear words or anything inappropriate - has_been censored by their ' moderators ' and blocked from being added to their website .
negative	i really regret dealing_with this company - avoid !!
negative	!
negative	i only gave this one star because zero_stars is not possible .
negative	why do computer manufactures bundle a trial version of the mcafee " anti_virus " software ... answer .
negative	because mcafee pay them to do so .
negative	i will never again buy a computer with this pre installed .
negative	it is , in my opinion , total over priced rubbish that can '_t be removed once your " free " updates expire and thus prevents installing free anti_virus alternative software .
negative	vote with your wallets guys , dump this software and don_'_t buy a computer with this already installed .
negative	we should be able to decide ourselves which anti_virus we want on our computers not mcafee .
negative	an executable file that cannot be removed = virus ...
negative	think about it !
negative	good at taking money no good at paying out .
negative	its like having no insurance at all when you come to claim unless you have receipts for everything you brought 0 years_ago , have your baggage strapped to your body constantly via locked chains or by not moving from your hotel .... ever .
negative	why_bother , save your money and look_elsewhere .
negative	i placed an order for a bed that was advertised as available for immediate delivery for next_day .
negative	after confirmation the bed did not arrive as indicated .
negative	got a an e_- mail saying someone tried to call me and the order has_been delayed and they will be in touch with regards to a new delivery date ( i checked my phone no messages or missed call ), so this was lie .
negative	a few_days_later after receiving no response i chased world_stores only to be told that the item was not available ( despite it being still advertised on the website ) and a refund has_been requested .
negative	it has_been 00 days since order was placed and i have received no refund .
negative	they are quick to take your money ( despite the item not being available ) but are not prepared to do a refund very quickly .
negative	i wonder_how much money they make from customer in this way ?
negative	i joined first_utility because of their advertising the roll out of ' smart_meters ', two years later and they have now stated that the roll - out is not going to happen . my rate was changed to a different rate without my knowledge and despite providing online meter_readings my bills are still being estimated , attempted to contact them but am getting an_automated_reply_stating ' due to an unprecedented level of interest , responses are taking longer_than usual - we will do our best to respond to your enquiry as quickly as possible .
negative	currently this may take up to 00 working_days ' poor , poor service - avoid at all costs
negative	received a broken light and we asked for replacement
negative	wrong_colour was despatched to us
negative	we are still_waiting for the right colour to come through to match with the rest

negative	treated_like_cattle , talked to like you were nothing , never again
negative	flowers were great .
negative	infact everything was great until the courier basically threw the flowers at the recipient .
negative	such a shame and a let_down to serenata .
negative	unfortunately i won_'_t be using them again due to this .
negative	having seen an installation done by quickslide and visiting their factory , we fell_into the trap and ordered windows and doors for our home from them .
negative	after more than 0 months , substantial damage to our home , mess and weeks of delays and frustration they still_haven_'_t finsished .
negative	the original installation was quoted to be 0 or 0 days but 0 months on and it still isn_'_t finished .
negative	the company has over promised and under delivered on just about everything .
negative	hugely disappointing and we are on the brink of handing the whole_thing over to our solictors .
negative	we wish we had never_heard of quickslide .
negative	we had a hotel booked to be able to attend the commonwealth games in glasgow in july_0000 .
negative	we booked and paid in full in october_0000 .

negative	they are still selling rooms on their website for much higher prices than we paid .... now we don_'_t have a hotel in glasgow because there is nothing available except for super hyper high prices because of the commonwealth games being on ...
negative	if you are ever tempted to use hotelsclick . com - just don_'_t : they are liars and cheats !!

negative	downright fraudulent !
negative	my experience was at evans_halshaw ( nissan ), wessington way , sunderland sr0 0rl
negative	i took a nissan_qashqai in for a ‘ full ’ service .
negative	a headlamp bulb had not worked for a number of weeks on the car and i had held off in the knowledge that a service was imminent .
negative	the car was in the custody of evans_halshaw from 0 . 00am to 0pm .
negative	when i collected the car , a service checklist was returned to me , with the vehicle and boxes were ticked to indicate that the following had been checked :
negative	“ all external lamps / indicator function ”
negative	“ headlamp aim ”
negative	this is , clearly , not the case as the headlamp bulb remained unlit / not functional .
negative	i had an electronic copy of the checklist which i scanned in on the photocopier at work .
negative	i telephoned the contact number indicated on the evans_halshaw documentation : and spoke to the aftersales leader .
negative	he was dismissive of my complaint and asserted that the mechanic / technician had fixed the bulb but that it had obviously broken or shorted out after i had driven the car away from the garage .
negative	he suggested that i return the car to the garage and he “ would look at it ”.
negative	there is nothing on the service documentation to suggest a fault had been identified and remedied .
negative	i believe that the aftersales manager was making a false assertion .
negative	i ' phoned the lease company the next_day who laughed in disbelief at evans_halshaw '_s pork pie .
negative	they asked me to take the car to kwik_fit who replaced the headlamp bulb , free of charge .
negative	i then reported evans_halshaw to trading_standards at city of sunderland council .
negative	i sent trading_standards the evans_halshaw checklist where they claimed to had checked the lamps were working .
negative	i also sent the email from kwik_fit and the lease company confirming that kwik_fit had replaced the bulb .
negative	the trading_standards officer went into visit evans_halshaw and emailed me the next_day ; ".... visited evans_halshaw [ nissan sunderland ] this afternoon and spoken to aftersales leader and dealer principal about your complaint .
negative	i have requested them to discuss the potential serious nature of this in the next team meeting with staff "
negative	at_least trading_standards now have a record of evans_halshaw '_s behaviour : their documentation asserted it had provided a ‘ full service ’.
negative	evans_halshaw stated that they have checked features on the car and it is clear they have not .
negative	keys were not cut correctly wasting my time and money
negative	i booked a flight with tripsta on the 00th of june .
negative	a day later , i received an email from tripsta indicating that the reservation has_been cancelled because they couldn_'_t contact me to verify my cd details .
negative	they promised to make a full_refund - see below :
negative	we are sending you this email regarding your booking id : f000xxxx , made with tripsta .
negative	we would like to inform you that we will refund any charge made on your credit_card .
negative	we apologize for any inconvenience_caused and thank_you for your understanding .
negative	i '_ve called several_times and they always tell me the refund has_been made .
negative	i was told the refund will reflect in my account after 0 days .
negative	it '_s been 00 days now and no refund .
negative	completely deceptive company .
negative	be ware !!
negative	!
negative	i should have ordered from amazon instead ....
negative	when comparing_prices online , you often go for the very cheapest - even if by just a few_pounds .
negative	it '_s easy to forget too that when it comes to online shopping - all shops are not equal .
negative	so when i needed to return the items i bought bathroom and showers_direct applied the letter of the law - and charged a completely pointless 00_% ' restocking ' charge .
negative	when you did want to speak to them sometimes the phone number just rang straight through till voicemail .
negative	so if you ' re thinking of buying from them - don_'_t bother .
negative	buy from amazon and stay protected .
negative	after trying to exchange a coat i bought online after ordering the wrong_colour i was told they couldn_'_t exchange it but had to have a refund then ' re order it i wasn_'_t impressed . after sending two emails to complain_about it i have still not received a reply from them and they now have the cheek to email me and ask me to rate them well if i could rate them lower_than one star i would have done
negative	i ordered and xbox play and charge controller set on dec 0nd and i only recieved conformation that it was dispatched on the 00th_dec which i thing is rediculous service !
negative	and now their is no garauntee i will get the item by christmas and i am appauled by this !
negative	if its showing as in stock then why did it take from 0nd dec untill 00th to be dispached !
negative	i actually dont even believe that i will ever even recieve the item at all after_reading the dreadfull revievs on this place and i cant_believe i didnt order from somewher i trust !
negative	avoid this company - say they will do daily backup of emails - they don_'_t , the most_recent is 0 days old .
negative	then fob you off that they are doing you a favour offering the backup to me ?
negative	this came about after they lost the emails and then try to blame it on me for deleting them .
negative	use any another email provider as then you know your emails are safe .
negative	i expected to get what i paid for , at the least .
negative	not with talk_talk .
negative	the broadband_connection is so poor that in the late evening it struggles to stream anything .
negative	its all fine their end though when they test the line .
negative	i dont care if i dont get the max broadband_connection , i just want a workable line .
negative	i was going to tranfer to a fibre connection as i thought this would solve the problem but the installation has_been cancelled twice ( a wait of a month ) and so i told them to cancel it .
negative	i '_m moving provider .
negative	avoid talk_talk , there so called customer_services are timewasters and their broadband_connection really is worse than dial up !
negative	couldn_'_t deliver .
negative	couldn_'_t advise , couldn_'_t care less
negative	the delivery company is useless .
negative	been two_weeks and they keep claiming to try deliver or they forget to pack it in the van .
negative	cost me more money than i was aiming to save .
negative	not worth using them again for this reason
negative	0 days_later and my order hasn_'_t been picked or shipped .
negative	i tried to contact customer service to cancel my order and guess_what ?
negative	they ' re closed on saturdays .
negative	awful experience and total_lack of customer service .
negative	if somethings not in stock or there is a problem you should send a email or get in contact with the customer .
negative	i '_ve never waited this long to have a order picked or shipped , and i usually receive my products within 0 - 0 days from every other company i use .
negative	i will not use supplement_warehouse again !!!
negative	!
negative	i have not seen my order yet
negative	they bring in a secure key card and you have to use it or you get basic internet access .
negative	i can '_t even send a secure message to them .
negative	without the secure key i have to call them to set_up any new payments , that i believe is fair_enough and did just that .
negative	i then had them transfer some monies to it .
negative	i believe that was all i would have to do and then any future payments i would do online as per normal , but no apparently , all payments to these new people will have to be done over the phone .
negative	this is ridiculous , every other bank only asks that i do it on the first payment to a new account / person etc .
negative	i don_'_t want a secure key pad for every account i have , i would need a suitcase to carry them around with me .
negative	why can '_t they do like santander where they confirm via a text_message to my registered mobile_phone .
negative	if i lose my phone i call them to cancel .
negative	item was for a birthday_present so i thought ordering 0 working_days in advance of the published 0 day delivery time would be ok . how wrong i was .
negative	having allowed the 00 days as instructed by the website i called to enquire where my package was .
negative	whilst the call_handler was pleasant enough , the same day email response promised never arrived .
negative	so much time had elapsed since i ' d placed my order that the price had now changed too .
negative	having promised that would be accounted for over the phone , nothing has_been forthcoming .
negative	this site might be ok if you ' re happy to wait up to a month for delivery as the price is good , but the service is lousy .
negative	ordered a netgear_router - they couldn_'_t supply at the price and then wouldn_'_t ( or couldn_'_t ) refund my credit_card .
negative	told me it took 0 to 00 days and then at 00 days changed their story to 00 days .
negative	credit_card dispute raised and money refunded by barclaycard .
negative	another concern is credible reports of fake_reviews - just google ' fake_reviews wae +' for more info .
negative	my advise is don_'_t touch them with a barge_pole as plenty of people seem to have had the same experience - refunds seem to be a big problem for this company .
negative	when i rang late rooms it was to try and cancel an error i made in booking the hotel , the cancellation was done quickly and effectively it was apparent when i turned_up at the hotel the request for it to include breakfast was not carried_out and rather spoilt the end of what had been a nice holiday
negative	when i bought the two bed side_tables i was told that if it is damaged then they will replace it only to be told we will repair it so i paid full price for damaged goods .
negative	i made a booking with argus on 00 september_0000 for a car with alamo in puerto montt chile on 00 december_0000 .
negative	alamo had no car for me when i arrived .
negative	i e_- mailed argus on 00 december_0000 and phoned on 0 january_0000 .
negative	i have had no reply or refund .
negative	i was a regular argus user (> 000 times in last ten_years ).
negative	i am very disappointed .
negative	i shall pursue the claim but i won_'_t use argus or alamo again because this example ( when things go_wrong ) shows a company '_s true_colours .
negative	i ordered a blackberry_playbook .
negative	it took 00 days to be despatched ( compare this to amazon and virtually every other online_retailer with same day or next_day despatch ).
negative	when it arrived it was clearly an american import because it had an american 0 - flat pin power adaptor .
negative	when i queried this they asked me to send a photograph so the matter could be referred to the right ‘ department ’.
negative	then instead of supplying a uk charger they sent me an adaptor for a uk three pin , but refused to send it to my home address insisting it had to go to the work address to which the playbook had originally been sent .
negative	this despite the fact that i was off work for three_weeks .
negative	i then discovered a problem with the play book .
negative	it would not ‘ talk ’ to my computer when i plugged it in to the usb_port .
negative	the playbook would ‘ see ’ the pc but the pc said it was an unrecognised device .
negative	i contacted blackberry support who could not have been more helpful , and with their assistance ran through a whole series of checks and tests , including using other pcs , and re - installs of the pc desktop software .
negative	nothing worked so i went back to simplyelectronics and reported the problem .
negative	they told me to send the device back , which i did by special delivery with guaranteed delivery by 0000 on the monday .
negative	it took 0 days , and two nagging emails from me to acknowledge the playbook had even arrived .
negative	two_days_later their engineers informed me there was nothing wrong with it .
negative	i challenged this .
negative	they repeated the assertion .
negative	i asked them to return the item .
negative	four days_later i received an email_saying the item had been despatched .
negative	the next_day i went on line and discovered the courier company had attempted to deliver the item two_days before that email .
negative	eventually i went to the depot and collected the delivery myself .
negative	when i plugged the playbook into my pc , to my surprise , it connected – once .
negative	they the same problem recurred !
negative	i wrote to simplyelectronics asking them to replace the playbook .
negative	they simply told me to return the item to them .
negative	there was no way i was going through that again , so i took it down to my local vodafone dealer .
negative	they discover some minor_damage to the contacts in the usb_port , which they seem to have fixed – hopefully it will stay fixed .
negative	i bought from simplyelectronics because they were cheap but the saving was not worth the hassles .
negative	the call_centre hang up on me 0 times
negative	out of the 0 agents i spoke to , one only i could understand and even then i got cut_off
negative	oh and i am not even with talktalk .
negative	i had my service from sky but apparently the previous tenant was with talktalk and the line that we thought was sky , in fact was talktalk .
negative	sky now got seriously involved so a resolution should be , i hope quick .
negative	seriously don_'_t deal with talktalk , they are rip_off_merchants with some dumb agents who call themselves by european names , knowing full well they are indians or whoever the hell they are
negative	what can i say , they are just bad , really bad .
negative	claiming they tried to deliver twice but we have a cctv_system and the only person_who delivered or came close to the door was a royal_mail guy .
negative	when i told the retailer i will be more than happy to provide the cctv_footage for both days , they went back to hermes and the answer was , we are sorry it actually didn_'_t get delivered .
negative	fotosense which they advertised as being in stock when it was not .
negative	i cancelled the order and received a reply saying the money had been refunded .
negative	the refund has not yet happened and i will probably have to raise a complaint against them with the card company .
negative	i will not consider_using them again .
negative	dont_bother they will spam you till you give up
negative	i bet this wont appear on your reviews , the truth hurts
negative	i have used quidco for years but they seem to be declining more and more cashback .
negative	i work out the cost of what i '_m buying including the cashback so when it is declined i feel particularly ripped_off .
negative	they also offer no help the decline a cashback apart_from saying they were refused .
negative	why ?
negative	i '_m told it was paid to someone_else ?
negative	who the hell did it go to as i '_m certain i didn_'_t bloody well get it !!!!
negative	!.
negative	ordered on 0th_feb , expected delivery on or by 00th_feb . order never arrived .
negative	told by customer_services that product number had changed and that would never have received goods although product was in warehouse .
negative	told it would be delivered by following friday 0st march at latest ., then when not received i was told by tuesday at the latest .
negative	still no receipt i chased again and told they do not know when i would receive the goods .
negative	i contacted them yet again on friday 0th_march , nearly one month after ordering only to be told that they didn_'_t know when goods would be received .
negative	i requested cancellation to be told would be refunded after 00 working_days .
negative	they are actually breaking distant selling_regulations 0000 act which states that must be refunded at the earliest_opportunity and in under 00 calandar days .
negative	do not touch this company .
negative	they are based in india with purely head_office in uk who you are not able to talk to .
negative	was promised delivery in 0 days , took 0 after making enquiry .
negative	i bought sennheiser cx000 earphones the sound is terrible , did some reserch on the web , they are fakes , much worse the standard ipod plugs which are supposed to be cheapies .
negative	please beware lot of fakes out there .
negative	reading_reviews on here i have no chance of refund .
negative	i got a wrong game .
negative	i mean i got heroes v might & magic instead of heroes v tribes of the east .
negative	the box of that game was right , but cd was wrong .
negative	cd was from another game .
negative	cloakroom toilet and cistern set .
negative	arrived next_day has said but was badly_damaged and high_gloss laquear was full of bits and dust .
negative	basin cupboard front corners brocken off .
negative	toilet_pan cracked up back corner .
negative	toilet cupboard bottom all smashed in .
negative	still_waiting for it all to be replaced a week_later .
negative	i run a plumbing business so im not happy with them and my customer is not happy with me .
negative	thank_you victorian_plumbing .
negative	why does it take longer to get replacments then it does to place a new order !
negative	ordered a mattress from mattress world .
negative	they use nightfreight as their delivery company .
negative	informed delivery date , but any time from 0 : 00 - 00 : 00 .
negative	thought fair_enough .
negative	delivery date came but no goods .
negative	telephoned mattress world , who were less_than helpful .
negative	informed that order had not been put on delivery truck .
negative	even_though this was their fault , had to waste another day waiting for delivery .
negative	any decent company would have offered an_hour delivery slot to minimise the inconvenience they had caused .
negative	when order came , driver wanted me to sign before he had taken the goods off the lorry without_any inspection .
negative	he was very rude when i said i ' d sign once i ' d seen the goods .
negative	they goods are clearly_marked " 0 persons to carry " but this delivery service sent one man to drag it off the lorry , potentially damaging it .
negative	if all that wasn_'_t bad enough , the driver had given me the clipboard with all the names and addresses of his jobs for that day - major breach of confidentiality .
negative	customers should not have to put up with the standards of delivery service offered by nightfreight and i advise people to think again before buying from companies that use this service .
negative	the delivery company mattress world use is part of the service they offer .
negative	if the delivery service is poor , and the staff at mattress world can not be_bothered to solve the problem , then obviously mattress world have little respect for their customers .
negative	just consider that before you buy from this company .
negative	i won_'_t be surprised , if they go the same way as comet , jessops and hmv !

negative	i am very disappointed with the quality of this ink_cartridge .
negative	all my prints are coming out half faded and very bad quality , which are unreadable and it has_been waste of money as the cartridge is useless for me !
negative	i booked through cruise . com and the cruise was cancelled and they said it was because i was british
negative	call_centre morons you won_'_t get anywhere if you have a problem
negative	use to be good now it '_s biased rubbish run by idiots
negative	had a htc_desire s that kept switching itself off .
negative	sent phone off from repair came back and within 0 minutes did the same .
negative	customer_services not interested , tried to put blame on me for the failed repair and told me a whole pack of lies when i ntried to take it further .
negative	in the end cut my losses and got an iphone .
negative	much more reliable
negative	i ordered a bathroom_taps , cistern and other bits - the goods were delivered speedily and arrived on a pallet and is of good quality - however i got charged_twice on my credit_card .
negative	i have called three_times and its been three_months and still no sign of my money .
negative	each time i call it seems as of the problem is going to sort_out and they say they will get back but they don_'_t .
negative	it '_s terrible .
negative	look at the website clearly - did you see the bit about the glasses taking 0_weeks ?
negative	- no just as well that you ' re not in any hurry .
negative	i ordered my glasses and received them in 0 separate lots .
negative	the first pair ( transitions_lenses in a half frame ) fell_apart in under 0 days .
negative	it '_ll take another 0_weeks to get another pair , by which time i '_ll have been on holiday for ages .
negative	" once we receive the glasses , we will contact you to explain the cause of the fault ," - yadda yadda yadda - they were poorly put_together - no explanation necessary - rubbish quality doesn_'_t have to be " explained ".
negative	just as well you can get a pair in a couple of hours on the high_street - which is where i suggest you go as_opposed to getting rubbish service and useless goods via the web .
negative	i did ask customer " services " if there was anything that could be done to expedite a properly built pair but my impression was that they couldn_'_t care less .
negative	well , while i was away , the replacement glasses appeared .
negative	this time the new lens was attached far too loosely so that there was a clear gap_between frame and lens .
negative	both lenses were badly smudged with grunge as if the operative had spent the lunch hour changing the oil on their car without washing their hands before bodging a pair of glasses together .
negative	back in the post - let '_s hope it '_s 0rd time lucky for this lacklustre bunch of amateurs .
negative	car_hire £_00 , damage_excess £ 0000 , damage_waiver £_00 .

negative	no still_waiting for a correct final statement , i made one payment to them for the 0 week period and then received a bill saying i still owed them ( on an estimated bill - even_though i had given them the readings on moving in ).
negative	called them four times to give them readings again ... two letter form collection agencies and one final demand ( threatening to appear at my doorstep ) later i am still_waiting for my final_bill .
negative	tried_calling them seven times and was on hold for over 00_mins every time ... rubbish company , rubbish staff ........ never use this company !
negative	!
negative	ordered 0 sets of earphones that were never delivered , sent loads of emails but was only told there was a problem and slight_delay ?
negative	groupon just said that as they had been sent by their supplier un - recorded they could ' nt do anything .

negative	had problems from day 0 with this company , ordered and had faults with teh trolley had to push round the course on first try .

negative	took parcel to my local parcel shop on friday 0th_december tried still not delivered on saturday the 00th .
negative	sent enquiry as to what the status was and where it was and just got an_automated_reply saying would get a response within_00hrs .
negative	nothing came .
negative	they are a complete_waste of space .
negative	might be cheap but in the long run they have cost me a fortune in having to replace the goods again for my ciustomer .
negative	use them at your_peril !!
negative	!
negative	have been waiting for an important delivery from dpd and would like to share my experience .
negative	day one , was sent an email_stating delivery window of 0000 - 0000 .
negative	left work early and lost money to get back on time .
negative	got home at 0000 and went outside to leave a note on my front_door to say , could they use the back door but there was a missed delivery note already there .
negative	no time was on it so i used my phone and checked the tracking_details .
negative	still was saying " out for delivery " kept refreshing it ontil at 0000 it changed to say that they were unable to deliver as nobody was in !
negative	why send a delivery window if your going to be early ?
negative	day two , email again saying window of 0000 - 0000 .
negative	got home at 0000 .
negative	put up note again , turned on outside lights and waited .
negative	kept refreshing tracking until at 0000 it said unable to deliver as nobody was in !!
negative	rang them and managed to get through to a person ( by putting in an incorrect calling_card number ) told them the situation and hey claimed the driver had gone to the wrong_address .
negative	i called this into doubt as it was the same package , same address , same driver ( daniel ) and i live in a small village with nt many properties .
negative	person said they would get the driver to turn_around and try again .
negative	i said great i would go outside and wait on the drive so the driver wouldn_'_t miss me .
negative	00_mins later i called back but they had no record of my earlier call and no message had been sent to the driver .
negative	i wasn_'_t happy .
negative	i got all the details from the person i talked to the second time and they were very apologetic but it wasn_'_t helping_me much as they said it was too late to turn him around now .
negative	it '_s now been arraigned for tomorrow ...
negative	i '_m not hopeful .
negative	i order lots of things online and by far the worst service i have received by a courier , is from dpd .
negative	i find it hard to believe that i '_m not being_lied to as none of what i '_ve been told adds up .
negative	if they had a truly local_depot i would have gone and got it but a round_trip of 0hrs is a bit much .
negative	please give me my package
negative	i bought a pergola of this company that deliver in 0 to 0 days well on day 0 i head not had this , i requested delivery to be on a wednesday .
negative	i got an email_telling_me it would be thursday .
negative	well thats no good to me . so i called them and i got the most unexpected display of customer service that i have ever had in my whole life .
negative	the guy i spoke to automatically argued with me for what reason i dont_know .
negative	then told me they will probably never be able to deliver my goods .
negative	so i said that in the case then i will have to cancel my orer then wont i . there reaction was to just hang up one me .
negative	can you believe that .
negative	i cant .
negative	so i have been emailing for days to get this confirmed that it is cancelled and i will be getting my money back .
negative	i will be contacting my credit_card otherwise .
negative	my suggestion forget edecks .
negative	there are many other_sites and shops that you can go to , avoid these like the plague .
negative	i would be very interested to know what the owner of the company thinks about his rude staff that hang up on you and treat you like crap .
negative	customer service agent sean what a vile creature .
negative	i would sack any member of staff like this in my company
negative	i had been very happy with the service from the splashbackpeople , quick to respond on email , even at weekends .
negative	the splash back did take a couple of weeks to arrive , but more trouble some was that it arrived damaged , a very small dimple in the metal .
negative	very annoying .
negative	initially the response was good , understanding over the phone and had a good record of my past corespondents .
negative	however they soon lost interest and started to give me the run around ..
negative	telling_me that a courier was picking it up soon and a replacement would be produced .
negative	in the end i got fed_up waiting and just asked for my money back , however they have so_far been unable to do this .
negative	in my opinion if you have no_problems with the goods from this company then they are probably ok , but if you experience any_problems then you may aswel set fire to your money .
negative	why do they always try to make it seem as though any fault is in one '_s own property even_though it is obvious to a blind man that a wire blowing about in the wind is the fault ?
negative	this must be the worst website on the net . they can never find the things you are looking for . if , for example , you were looking for blackpool tower the website would come_back and ask you which town that was in and other equally innane questions .
negative	so_far so good but my purchase hasn_'_t been delivered yet ?
negative	the order status on my order has changed to ' picking '.
negative	what does this mean .
negative	they treat me like a thief and at the end they lost !
negative	realy bad !!!!!!!!!!!!
negative	avoid they only want your money !!
negative	!
negative	should be rather called " post sovjet adventure living ".
negative	the published pictures of apparent location do not meet reality , but smelly environment with run down cheap furniture .
negative	at_least does not meet western travelers ' expectations !
negative	i expected a cosy stylish home feeling but could only take it with many year russia experience and lots of humor .
negative	they are still posting on their blog and social_media ?
negative	they are still ***** operating ??!
negative	!
negative	" livingdesign europ " is what showed up on bank_statement as the company if it helps .

negative	sorry can '_t really review the flowers as they were not delivered .
negative	the tracking said the flowers were delivered at 0 . 00 to a building that doesn_'_t open until 0 . 00am .
negative	i got a text to say the flowers were at the front_door , not really possible unless the driver climbed an 0 foot gate .
negative	still_waiting back to here from serenata_flowers .
negative	very poor customer_services
negative	i '_ve bought 0 costumes from joker '_s - the first was a female oktoberfest outfit which was falling_apart after one day wearing it , i tried to wash it and it ended_up staining half my clothes because the colour ran .
negative	i then bought two halloween_costumes - 0 psycho ward which we actually sent back because it was so badly made and the mask that came with it was not at all like the picture and when we tried to wear it , it didn_'_t mould to your face and was actually painful to wear .
negative	i also bought a tinkerspell outfit and one of the straps broke before i ' d even left the house .
negative	i ended_up having to wear another top underneath it because it was really badly made and completely the wrong_size .
negative	really disappointing service .
negative	when returning the psycho ward outfit , we didn_'_t get any postage back , just the amount of the outfit so i ' d say this is an unsatisfactory returns_policy for such a large online company .
negative	definitely won_'_t be using this website again .
negative	anyone who looks at it should really be aware that the pictures are nothing like what actually turns_up !
negative	i know that we shouldn_'_t expect much for outfits that are only £_00 but seriously , i ' d rather spend my money elsewhere for the quality that we haven_'_t got through joker '_s .
negative	if anyone is looking for a really cool costume , go to primark because they have awesome cheap stuff in there and then you can at_least see what you ' re buying and try it on before wasting your money .
negative	we got a bat onesie from there for halloween and it was amazing and much_cheaper_than joker '_s .
negative	after paying £_00 for next_day delivery and order it to my work address so i wouldn_'_t have to miss a day of work , nothing shows up .
negative	then received and e_- mail saying " we tried to deliver your order from overclockers however there was no one available to sign for the order at the address below ".
negative	0st - that '_s a lie because i work at a garage and there '_s always people around who can call me .
negative	0nd - no one ever saw anyone from dpd .
negative	and it makes me so upset that even after the e_- mail i tried to find a number to call someone from dpd to explain what happen , i couldn_'_t find any number on their web_site .
negative	then again it '_s no surprise that with such a crappy service .
negative	you sent me the wrong item , and then took months to correct it .
negative	many_times i had to ring your international desk , and had to wait for a quite unacceptable length of time .
negative	one day i rang over and over again before giving up , only to be told on a subsequent day that you had all been on holiday , but no message had been left to that effect .
negative	to my astonishment i eventually discovered that you had had the correct item in for weeks but were waiting for the incorrect item to be collected and returned before sending it out .
negative	why ?
negative	at first you expected me to take care of the return shipment and only reluctantly_agreed to arrange_collection yourself .
negative	to see how things should have been handled you should study another german company supplying design goods , fab their system is as good as yours is bad .
negative	waited over two_weeks for my order and when i opened it i found they had sent me the wrong thing .
negative	after talking with their hopeless staff they had agreed to collect the package and give me a refund however , after another week no on came to collect it .
negative	after wasting me of my time on the phone to them they sent another courier to collect the parcel .
negative	the courier came and i thought that was the end but , after two_weeks no payments have been received .
negative	terrible service , terrible company and avoid at all cost !
negative	no more junk_mail please !!!!
negative	!
negative	so pleased i moved to a better & cheaper server !
negative	should have done it years_ago
negative	use the catalogue to choose your item , then buy on line
negative	i placed order on 0nd_july for gift , 00 hr delivery , £_00 out of pocket , still not arrived , contacted live help twice , emailed twice and left 0 messages , next step is my bank and trading_standards ..
negative	it says they will respond within 00_hrs , never have i had such a bad service from on line supplier .
negative	web sales grow on customers confidence , as a previous customer to bed room pleasures , i certainly won_'_t be using again a
negative	i cannot_believe the bbc have sold out regarding the coverage of formula 0 .
negative	this surely will reduce the appeal to new and old audiences alike .
negative	i am new to formula 0 and found the coverage fantastic .
negative	why don_'_t you listen to the thousands of fans and spend money on this fantastic sport that promotes everything that is good about human achievement rather_than some boring drama .
negative	the initial arrival at the parking lot was ok and the lift to the airport was fine .
negative	but on our return to the uk we were left waiting for almost two hours
negative	despite making the phone_call to confirm we was clear of baggage_reclaim .
negative	and being told the transport would be 00 - 00_minutes almost two hours_later it finally arrived with the comments that the guy_who took my phone_call had turned off the fones so they went to answer phone .
negative	will not be using this service again and will be advising friends and family to steer_clear .
negative	the poor guy_who did come out bore the full brunt of our anger for which i apologise but the real culprit is those in charge .
negative	avoid if you do not wish to be left in freezing_cold_weather for non_existant transportation .
negative	i was a bit upset by charging me twice for the parcel i sent to southern_ireland .
negative	it was mistaken by your network , i have to paid out 00 pounds extra , on top of the original cost , it make it very expensive , if i knew that beforehand , i will not sending the parcel out at the first place .
negative	and why you sending me the invoice after the parcel has_been accepted and delivered .
negative	kind_regards
negative	budgetair appear to trade under various different guises .
negative	booked return flights london to koh samui , via bangkok on british_airways and connecting with bangkok airways .
negative	immediately after payment , realised there was a one - character mistake in my surname .
negative	despite their booking process clearly not being automated ( our e_- ticket arrived the next_day ) and advising them straight_away , they claimed it would cost about £_000 -£_000 to correct .
negative	i contacted british_airways directly and asked what they could do , and they said they would always make changes like this for nothing , but it was an agency booking so budgetair had to instigate the change by calling their helpline .
negative	i explained this to budgetair but still they said it would cost £_000 fee .
negative	pretty_steep , considering the entire return flight was only about £_000 !
negative	eventually i gave up with their call_centre in amsterdam , despite escalating my issue to a ' manager '.
negative	to be honest , they had some difficulty completely understanding english .
negative	i said i ' d rebook the flights again directly with british_airways and just take them to court ( citing unfair fees ) to get my money back off them .
negative	i left it at that , and a few_days_later ( after various token reductions in their fee demand ) miraculously they decided that they could make the change after all at no charge , albeit meaning both people travelling would be on separate bookings ( which was fine ).
negative	so it all turned_out ok in the end , but i had to be pretty tough with them to make them play ball , and i expect most people would just allow themselves to be stitched up with unfair and completely unjustified fees .
negative	i would have been happy to pay a reasonable fee for the change - it was my mistake after all .
negative	also , not entirely budgetair '_s fault , also they failed to mention that our bags would not be checked (' interlined ') all the way through to koh samui , meaning we ' d have to collect them at bangkok and check them back in .
negative	despite them sorting everything out , the fact that i had to basically bully / threaten them into it means i can '_t possibly award anything more than 0_star .
negative	edit - i felt a bit_harsh for originally awarding them one star and revised it up to two , but since they '_ve left a pretty_useless ' response ' trying to justify their behaviour i '_m putting it back to one again .
negative	i don_'_t know why i bother visiting .
negative	another global monster who are happy taking your money but do not give customer service or care about the produce the peddle .
negative	i ordered a curtain_pole which for the price , i was expecting to be solid_oak , however , when it arrived i was very disappointed to find it was cheap softwood , stained an oak colour !
negative	i could have bought something very similar for a fraction of the price .
negative	not good value for money .
negative	having had reasonable success with serenata before i tried them again .
negative	having posted requirements i was informed on the day of delivery at 00 . 00_hours they had been dispatched .
negative	at 00 . 00_hours i am informed they have been delivered to a secure_location - a different address in the same road on the opposite_side .
negative	like all the others here .
negative	ordered a big_boy bean_bag on 0th_november_0000 .
negative	i have not had any response from the company and no emails explaining the delay since my order confirmation was sent on 0th_november .
negative	if this goes on much longer then we should all take legal_action and retrieve the money through our credit_cards .
negative	i ordered my appliance over three_months_ago .
negative	it eventually arrived this week .
negative	apparently , ' go_electrical ' couldn_'_t get the appliances from the factory so the problem was transferred to me .
negative	they could and should have got a supply from elsewhere , even if a meant a small loss to them .
negative	i am not impressed .
negative	we just bought some curtains for home delivery .
negative	their delivery agents have gone into_liquidation and hof have taken the money .
negative	they are extremely reluctant to refund it , even_though the contract was obviously with them and not the agents ( an outfit called montgomery , which we had never_heard of ).
negative	we have not finished with them yet , but we expected better service than this .
negative	it was only a small order for some photo_printing paper , but it never arrived .
negative	when tackled about it the responses were rude and the emails weren_'_t even read .
negative	only half of the ones i paid for stated coming up ; 0 out of 00 , the free ones only 0 out of 00 have came up .
negative	very dissatisfied .
negative	will be ordering from some other company next time .
negative	i brought a car from trade_centre wales in may i was there for 0 hours waiting for everything to go through i was late for work because the kept me waiting i got the car in the end and traveled home the next_day i noticed that the windscreen had chips and a crack in it the gear box was banging and crunching the oil light kept coming on even known there was oil in the car the air bag light was on saying inspect so i phoned t . c . w about the problems they told me to bring the car back up so they could have a look so i did i was up there for about an_hour they came out to see me and told me the gear box is knackered i said to them well i now that but what about the other stuff and they said there is nothing wrong with it air bag is fine no oil light on so i questioned them and said so your telling_me there is no fault with the air bag even nowing the airbag light comes on and says inspect and they said yes nothing wrong with it so they told me to bring the car up 0_weeks_later to get it sorted which i was not very happy about because they are trying to let the warrrenty run out i then asked if they will pay for my fuel to get back home and back up as its not my fault the car is knackered they said no we dont do that which really put me over the edge i then said see you in 0_weeks so i then went to see the manager about what the mechanic said to me about the airbag like and all and he said he will get on to them and get back to me i said i am not happy with this car and want to change it remember i only had it 0 days they said no you cant change it even knowing they sold me a car that is broken i then questioned them on the 00 point check about the window and the gearbox as they put on there that it was all fine when it wasnt and they said it was fine when they checked it which i think is a load of bull i waited 0 days for the manager to phone me back and he never so i phoned a number of times and he still didnt phone me back so i reported them to trading_standards all i think they are selling dodgy cars i would stay well away because once you get the car you are totally f_** ked so stay well away they are useless and the managers cant even be_arsed to phone you back which just proves a point they now they have done wrong
negative	hello , being a regular dfds traveller ( and usually a big supporter !)
negative	i was shocked to receive diluted double g & t '_s on our wednesday ( 0th_oct .) sailing from newcastle to amsterdam on the queen ( caberet room bar ) it was our first ( and only ) drink and i asked to speak to a manager and a lady_called anna dutifully arrived ( very nice ) and exchanged them for the correct drink .
negative	i ( we ) are not excessive drinkers but we know our g & t '_s and let_me tell you someone somewhere is watering your spirits !
negative	although anna said that this wasn_'_t so .
negative	in your interest you should arrive un - announced and find out for yourselves .
negative	please respond to this note an keep me in the loop as to the outcome ... i am not wrong !
negative	!
negative	before we were quit happy to book , but now no response , no service if you have a problem a the agency you rented the car .
negative	probably to much success and not able to cope with that .
negative	why sell something on your website that you dont have !
negative	sent a car stereo that now is broken , no insurance available .
negative	ebay buyer blaming me for damage .
negative	paid evans for an estimate for accident damage after crash .
negative	forgot to do it first time and had to go back a second time and pay for cab both_times as bike was unrideable .
negative	i trusted their estimate and got money from insurers for a new frame and eventually got around to buying a new one .
negative	when i came to rebuild bike i removed the bar_tape and found the £_000 set of carbon bars had snapped almost clean through leaving me £_000 out of pocket as it was too late to claim .
negative	when i contacted evans for an appology they refused to beleive me and said the damage must have been caused while the bike was stood in my house waiting to be rebuilt .
negative	its nice to know that they are willing to risk customers lives by not carrying out basic checks such as checking for damage under bar_tape after an accident .
negative	if the frame was not cracked i would have trusted their judgement and cycled through london with a set of bars almost sheared through .
negative	however to add_insult to injury they then accuse the customer of lying and blame them for the damage they missed .
negative	avoid , avoid_avoid !!
negative	!
negative	watch this space !
negative	!
negative	i '_ve been sending email enquiries to this company for a month in regard to one of their products , but they appear to have chosen to ignore me .
negative	i won_'_t be bothering again and will simply take my custom elsewhere .
negative	if a company won_'_t respond to a simple product enquiry then just imagine their attitude_towards a customer who had a problem .
negative	i had to sent it back the same day the colour is very very bad when i put it on its like re dis not middle / brown plus that i had to pay the post for sending it back i will never order it any more i would not recommend it to my family and friends
negative	ordered a game 0_weeks before_xmas as a present , bear in mind that i '_ve ordered from shopto , loyally , for years .
negative	this time i didn_'_t get the usual photo email / mms to say it had been dispatched and the game didn_'_t arrive within the usual day or two .
negative	after a week i guessed it hadn_'_t been sent , so i contacted customer_services to request a replacement in time for xmas and was told that i had to wait 00 working ( 00 actual ) days before they would even discuss a replacement ( the game was £_00 and i ' d spent a fortune on 000 games in the previous years ).
negative	i appealed to their spirit of good customer service , which is apparently non - existent , and even quoted distance_selling legislation , where they ' d quoted two day delivery and it was now 00 days and it obviously wasn_'_t coming .
negative	but rather_than look after a regular , loyal , paying customer , they closed my account when they refunded me after a drawn_out returns process .
negative	because i ' d said i could use visa_chargeback for a refund and not have to post a hand signed form to their head_office .
negative	never mind , i just preordered my xbox one titanfall bundle from game instead and zavvi have better pre order prices on games .
negative	what happened , shopto . net ?
negative	i thought you had my back like i had yours ?
negative	i thought we were bro '_s for life , then i ask one little favour and you drop me like we never meant nothin .
negative	now i see you for what you really are .
negative	you cold .
negative	ring your bank and ask about the chargeback procedure , it '_s good for debit / credit_cards and can be instigated after 00 days .
negative	money back with no more hassle .
negative	then order from bedtimeheaven . co . uk instead , they deliver within a couple of days .
negative	good luck you lot !
negative	maybe the last time ............
negative	so we paid a fortune for hyde_park hospitality including seats .
negative	viagogo receipt indicated row and seat numbers but no tickets in pack .
negative	seller said just tell them at hyde_park ticket office , but they were not interested .
negative	no ticket no seats !
negative	great concert but could have done with seats as it was 00_degrees on 00 th july .
negative	viagogo have been silent despite several emails and a poor response to their customer survey .
negative	maybe this will provoke a response and preferably some recompense .
negative	transaction_id_0000000
negative	the only reason i am not returning it is that i cannot get to the post_office am_disabled
negative	loved the texting system re delivery .
negative	sadly it wasn_'_t accurate .
negative	texts told me flowers had been delivered around 0pm .
negative	actually delivered at 0 and therefore after the time of the office being open .
negative	and the bunch of flowers was insulting .
negative	£_00 for a few blooms .
negative	dreadful value .
negative	one customer lost .
negative	" your parcel has_been left with your neighbour at no 0 / 0 "
negative	awesome !
negative	thanks !
negative	0 / 0 has_been unoccupied for at_least 0 months and nobody_else in the apartment_block has my parcel !
negative	been on hold for 00_mins at 00p / min trying to get through to customer_services .
negative	what a joke !
negative	if the rest of the reviews are anything to go by i can kiss my parcel goodbye !
negative	trying to make changes to my booking involved endless referrals on their helpline , all resulting in being cut - off or sent to a voicemail_message .
negative	the one person that sounded_like he knew what he was talking_about said it was a bad line ( i could hear him perfectly ), told me he ' d call me back , but never did .
negative	no games anymore , so cancelled my 0 year long subscription .
negative	business suicide .
negative	i ordered my product on a tuesday with hopes of delivery for the friday .
negative	i picked_up my puppy on the friday with no sign of puppy_food from yourselves .
negative	as it was a double bank_holiday ( queens jubilee ) i accepted this and didn_'_t think about it again until te following thursday .
negative	still no sign of my product .
negative	i then rang customer_services and was promptly informed that i hadn_'_t paid for my product and this is why i hadn_'_t yet received it .
negative	0 minutes later i provided my paypal payment confirmation details and was then told that there had been a mistake between paypal and yourselves but confirmed i had actually paid for the product and it would be dispatched the next_day as a priority .
negative	at which point it was then said that in future i needed to check my order statuses changed from received to processed , as though it was my responsibility to check your back office were doing their job correctly .
negative	i felt this was quite rude .
negative	further to this , one week_later i get a knock on the door from a neighbour who took_ownership of my eventual delivery 0 days prior as i had been out at time of delivery but courier didn_'_t leave a ' i missed you note ' so i we unaware of this .
negative	your prices are great but your system is flawed beyond function
negative	i have been using the asda grocery delivery service for the last_year as my local asda is miles_away and as i do monthly grocery_shopping , found it a convenient solution to long shopping excursions with limited time .
negative	despite my first delivery from asda being absolutely disastrous as the driver forgot to unload all the fresh good , the situation was eventually resolved through a refund and £ 0 evoucher for the inconvenience , i decided to give them another change .
negative	unfortunately this seems to have been a misguided notion as last night i was called by the delivery driver 00_minutes before my delivery window would finish ( 00 : 00 ) to be told that the vehicle has broken down and as it is not store policy to redeliver , i will be receiving a refund after which i can place a new order .
negative	as a student with a small family , my finances are very limited and thus i purchase my monthly groceries to be sufficient for the month before paying all other bills .
negative	thus i don_'_t have another £_000 to pay for another grocery delivery until the money is refunded .
negative	i do understand that vehicle breakdowns are beyond anybody '_s control , but am not understanding of the fact that asda does not rectify their failure by arranging for a re - delivery at the earliest convenience .
negative	to make_matters_worse , when contacting the customer service center this morning to discuss this matter , i was informed that it shouldn_'_t take longer_than 0 days and after becoming rather adamant that i do still require the delivery or require the money to be refunded in a manner that i can receive it earlier , i was told that they would call the store to see whether they are ' willing ' to ' help me out ' after which they would contact me immediately to notify_me of the decision .
negative	five hours_later i have still not received a call and called the customer service team again to be told that they do not know what has_been done about the earlier call or email that i sent and repeated the whole_process from 0 hours earlier .
negative	fortunately this assistant was a little more helpful as she called me within ten_minutes to inform_me that she has spoken to a picking assistant that now needs to speak to his manager to find out whether they can once again attempt to ' accommodate ' me .
negative	two hours_later i have still not received a phone_call thus meaning that i will possibly have to try to borrow money to feed my family for the weekend and beyond until i can actually purchase my intended items from a different company .
negative	after this experience , i can only_assume that my £ 0000 p . a grocery_shopping that have mostly been spent at asda is too insignificant to warrant any form of customer_care and as such i am happy to let my feet do the talking to a different retails .
negative	advice : plan for the good and bad_experiences with asda because as a whole the good is ok and the bad is an example of absolutely horrible customer service !
negative	!
negative	order no 000000
negative	i received an email from lindy on 00rd_august stating they had shipped the order 0st_class , today is the 0th_september and i have received nothing / heard_nothing .
negative	appalling service i cannot understand all the positive_comments .
negative	so if i hear nothing further and dont receive product or refund then small_claims court and off to maplins .
negative	this is a cowboy firm what the quote on line is not the price at the airport you think you have paid all the access but it doubles at the airport
negative	hi ,
negative	i tried purchasing from this company and my payment did not process .
negative	their message was that my purchased had been flagged as suspicious and their customer service department requested a copy of my driver '_s license ( requested 00 may 0000 00 : 00 - by amy d .)
negative	i never sent this copy , and i have also requested them to delete / remove any info about myself from their system on 00 may 0000 00 : 00 - but never_heard about it .
negative	they have refunded me the money and after my first post ( this is the second ) they have actually given * for free * the licenses that i was trying to buy (~ £_00 ).
negative	but that is not correct - just be honest from the start .
negative	i provided my paypal_account and a mobile_phone .
negative	why do you need my driver '_s license ?
negative	i have received a full_refund as well .
negative	but i still have a bad_taste in my mouth .
negative	cdkeys . com : order approval 00000000000
negative	your postal_system was crap , my goods wre given to my neighbour , and i will not be using dive_inn for future , unless you can make it more secure .
negative	what a waste of time
negative	all contacts with first furniture were a disaster , nothing happened as promised in numerous phone_calls
negative	i am still_waiting for my order and the company just refuse to reply or respond .
negative	do not fall for the ever so nice website .
negative	took my money and that '_s it .
negative	criminals and scum .
negative	without a doubt , the worst company i have ever_dealt_with .
negative	i have experienced significant quality issues with the sandringham tv bed that we purchased from bensons .
negative	it took 00 calls for customer service ( hahaha ) to actually do something to address my issues .
negative	note - they never call their customers back .
negative	every call was initiated by me .
negative	the engineer that they arranged to attend agreed that the tv lift mechanism was indeed faulty .
negative	two_weeks_later and bensons hadn_'_t called following this visit - so rang them to ask .
negative	they stated that they had the report but just needed to check on what they would do next .
negative	we '_ll call you tomorrow .
negative	a week and a half later with no call .
negative	call them back to be told the bed is now discontinued .
negative	my choices - wait_until june for the replacement .
negative	have a refund .
negative	i will have the refund thanks as i have had it with this company .
negative	i will never buy anything from them again .
negative	this company is part of an organisation that owns many bad carparking companies .
negative	including kkarparks ltd . more car parking .
negative	airport_parking choices and comparemeetandgreet .
negative	do not use them under any circumstances as i promise you you '_ll be disappointed .
negative	we had to cancel our appointment with them and , to this date , have not had a refund .
negative	they have even gone to the trouble to cancel the email address that we were given for contacting them
negative	this company and any company associated to it is completely illegal and will either park your car in an unsafe place or they will steal your money .
negative	do not use .
negative	this is a complete and utter scam .
negative	they are not a real car parking company and are not supported_by any organisations that regulates car parking .
negative	all companies that show up under their " compare " are part of their " group " of scam companies .
negative	they will not park your car in a secure place .
negative	we cancelled the agreement with them as we saw many bad_reviews about one of their other_websites and have never , to this day , received a refund .
negative	they '_ve even deleted the email address we had for contacting them .
negative	absolutely_shocking .
negative	i am now pursuing them through my bank and most_likely will go through small_claims .

negative	when ordering parts from a . co . uk website you may be_fooled into thinking this is a uk_based company ...... wrong ...... they in fact send items from germany !
negative	!
negative	not once was i informed of this until i received my tracking_information and noticed it had international package on the details section and was still in germany 00_hours after ordering .
negative	i have nothing against items being shipped from overseas but i would have appreciated a little more honesty and a little_bit of an obvious notification that items are being shipped from overseas or that they are in fact based outside of the uk .
negative	customer_services were prompt in a response after stating they had been reported to trading_standards for not making me aware at any point of the ordering_process i was purchasing outside the uk .
negative	however they would still not admit they were deceiving customers by not stating " clearly " anywhere items are shipped from over_seas .
negative	items are of good quality however but i got sick of waiting and ordered elsewhere and have returned the items from 00mx straight back to germany with their freepost_returns system .
negative	if you are not in a rush and don_'_t mind not knowing where your items are coming from then they are a great place to buy from but i prefer clarity when i spend my money on what i would consider as a medium priced order .
negative	i have given 0_star merely because i do not appreciate being deceived and not notified or informed that items are shipped from overseas .
negative	i did the purchase while in england , but in a week the purchase has not arrived .
negative	it was sent to the wrong_address .
negative	i tried_contacting the store dozens of times to get the order in the store but got no return .
negative	now i '_m trying to cancel the order but the store does not answer me .
negative	won_'_t use again .
negative	after waiting in a full two_days for item to be collected i cancelled and got my money back .
negative	very poor customer service .
negative	after calling company three_times found it to be very expensive with now way of compensation .
negative	frankly i ' d have been quicker collecting my order myself .
negative	over night delivery took a week and every tine i got in touch i was fended off with lies and promises that were always broken .
negative	then to top it off another parcel from another retailer got the same treatment at the same time .
negative	this has_been the fourth and fifth time that yodel have let_me down .
negative	they said they couldn_'_t find me and that the parcels were improperly addressed .
negative	this was not true they were correctly_addressed and in the week while i waited [_external_reference_],_[_external_reference_],_[_external_reference_],_[_external_reference_] and [_external_reference_] all made it to my door .
negative	yodel are useless and i would never recommend them to anyone , ever !
negative	do not use bravofly - total_rip - off !
negative	they took my money and then couldn_'_t confirm the flight or provide a ticket .
negative	no one answers the " all times " help line and they charge you for the call !
negative	then i went to cancel the booking that they couldn_'_t confirm and they charge a " penalty " to cancel .
negative	sent 0 phones and one had a slightly loose back cover ( new one purchased from amazon for £ 0 . 00 ) and had the price reduced on the phone quote by £_00 , not the first person to have had this done when speaking to other people about it , was not impressed and would not recommend them !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
negative	!
negative	tried 0 times unsuccessfully to ask hsbc a couple of simple questions about their mortgage products ( because they didn_'_t provide the information online ).
negative	last 0 calls - on hold for 0 hour on 0st call then gave up because i thought i might be better trying one of their other contact_numbers ( i had phoned 0000 000 0000 ).
negative	0nd time ( phoned 0000 000 0000 ) - even worse - still on hold after 0 hours !!
negative	i '_ve never experience such poor customer response in all my life .
negative	i '_ve just wasted 0 hours of my weekend trying to contact them !
negative	bottom_line - i was considering re - mortgaging with them , but i '_m going to take my business elsewhere .
negative	although they offered the best deal , it '_s not worth the hassle and stress if you need to contact them .
negative	i would recommend anyone_else to try a different bank , especially for mortgage products .
negative	even if they offer the best deal , think about the stress and hassle trying to contact them further down the line .
negative	useless complete_waste of time and money
negative	instead of joining orange :
negative	buy a pigeon , clip its wings and blindfold it .
negative	rig up a sound system to rival glastonbury and from it ; play from the mating coo of a frisky female hen from the opposite direction of your intended receivers location , and it '_ll still do a better job delivering communications than orange !
negative	after 0_weeks of no signal at home and speaking with orange , nothing has_improved and poor poor communication from their cs ' team '.
negative	the fault was caused ( according to orange ) by a faulty mast .
negative	however , even with a faulty mast apparently all you need to do is turn our phone on / off , go into flight mode blah_blah_blah zzzzzzzzzzz .
negative	no , no , no .
negative	all communication is one way - they never contact to give any sort of update which is just infuriating .
negative	if you don_'_t know how annoying it is to be told the same thing numerous_times a day without resolution , sign up to orange and find out there are 0 companies i would never ever join if i had the choice ( my phone and contract is company supplied ).
negative	they are talktalk ( vomit in my mouth ) and orange ( ooo i just felt my sphincter tighten ).
negative	i '_m having real trouble deciding who is worst - they ' re just both so terrible .
negative	so please_please_please don_'_t give them the satisfaction of your money - another company that many many_years used to be good - gone to the dogs .
negative	i could write more , but like me you '_ll end up wanting to gouge out your eyeballs eventually .
negative	ok , so it says i should write this review as if i '_m speaking to a friend ...
negative	here goes ....
negative	what a bunch of absolute c ## ts .
negative	this company is the most devious i '_ve come_across , and i thought amazon were bad !
negative	after you cancel your service ( they put the prices up and invited me to cancel ' without charge ') i still seem to be getting billed for a ' contract breakage fee '.
negative	i feel very sorry for those who have been fleeced by this bunch of wa # k # rs .
negative	after you cancel the service and move to another service provider , talktalk no_longer recognise your phone number .
negative	guess_what , when you try to contact them by phone , their automated service requires you to enter your phone number .
negative	of course this isn_'_t recognised and you can '_t get past this stage to speak to someone .
negative	i had to call a different number and pretend i wanted to buy a mobile_phone package .
negative	when i explained i wanted to speak with someone about broadband and phone , they put me through and once i explained i wasn_'_t paying their charge and had them pinned against a wall , they actually hung_up on me ( and i was being polite !
negative	).
negative	they don_'_t answer their emails within what i would call a reasonable time ( 0 working_days on many occasions ) so i have had no option but to cancel my direct_debit to stop the cu # ts taking money from me which is not theirs to take .
negative	this company knows exactly_what they ' re doing , and if this is what they do to earn_money and pay their shareholders then the future is not very bright for them .
negative	0 . 0 out of 00 from nearly 000 reviews really says it all !
negative	f . u talktalk
negative	i placed an order last_year and it got totally coc * ed up , ending in a refund and redelivery .
negative	0 months or so on , i though it maybe time to try again , how wrong i was .
negative	i ordered a valentines_day arrangement ,.
negative	i cannot tell you how embarrassing it is , and how what is supposed to be a loively gesture to my girlfriend is nothing of the sort .
negative	i wish i could attach a pictuie of the arrangement i purchased verses what actaully arrived , along with the fact that i also paid for chocolates which weren_'_t delivered .
negative	i have a picture , but just can ; t attach it , all i '_ll say is that it '_s a total_con to cash in on desperate unknowing men around the country and misadvertising is an_understatement .
negative	absolutely_terrible , it '_s a shame that interflora is such a huge name globally and this review will do nothing to dent that , although if one person reads this and doesn_'_t order from them as a result i suppose it is worth something .
negative	last time i used their service and it went worng i thought i was unlucky , but looking at the overall rating on many review sites ( between 0 and 0 out of 0 ) then i guess not .
negative	perhaps the next victim of high_street administration if it carries on with these sort of service levels , i doubt it if they continue to fleece their customers in this way , but i hope so .
negative	i could type a lot about this company but don_'_t have time , all i will say is :
negative	only order from these_people if :
negative	you want to pay for something and never receive it
negative	you want to be lied to
negative	you want to send emails and never get a reply
negative	you would like to receive sales emails from a company that has failed to deliver your original order
negative	you like being_ripped_off !
negative	if after_reading this you chose to do_business with them , don_'_t say you weren_'_t warned !
negative	i ordered some flowers on the 00th for my wife to arrive on valentines_day .
negative	upon tracking the order with yodel i noticed that they have the wrong_address details .
negative	however upon_checking my order i have out the correct details in ( i think i know where we live by now )
negative	i actually managed to get through to iflorist after 0 attempts on the phone and the lady told me that a mix_up had occurred and that she would upgrade the flowers to a delivery from a local_florist .
negative	today is the 00th and still nothing .
negative	terrible_terrible service .
negative	they have not responded to my e_- mails and will not answer the call .
negative	i want my money back and i want compensation .
negative	i have told them in my email that i will pursue this through solicitors unless i get a response and not excuses .
negative	as my father in law would say - incompetence .
negative	i am utterly_disgusted and even more disgusted they will not answer my call and face the music .
negative	================================================================
negative	iiflorist will refund me .
negative	great .
negative	now for the letter from the md and then my return letter .
negative	and now after writing a letter to me they have not responded again .
negative	beware buyers ....
negative	it appears that iflorist has removed my review .
negative	until i get a suitable answer i shall_continue posting this
negative	still no word from this absolute_joke of a florist .
negative	i hope if you ordered for your mum she is not disappointed .
negative	we have been for 0 year with this company .
negative	the whole year is bad_experience .
negative	when agreement between payment sense and us was made - they say : no rolling_contract and hidden_fees , standard payment all the time which was agreed over the phone , free cancellation any day or time .
negative	after agreement was made - that '_s where all problems started : the agreed charge was triple ( they started to divide the agreed charge by a few different accounts and merchants and tried to explain that these are all different things which were extra charged - this was never explained .
negative	customer service - horrible - they never call you back after agreement is made and you start paying .
negative	and finally , when you try to cancel their services - they are not helpful by making you stay for another 00 days as cancellation period - so you must pay them even_though the service is not used .
negative	when you consider someone for long_term and with good operation and service - i would never recommend them to anyone .
negative	please have a look at [_external_reference_]
negative	thank_you
negative	thank_you
negative	i was given a gift token for ticketmaster .
negative	in small_print is a warning that it expires after a year .
negative	no date when it was bought .
negative	no reply when trying to contact them when it was to lapse .
negative	in fairness , you can get the value on line .
negative	finally , the number of shows to which you can go to are very limited if you live outside of london .
negative	what a poor present !
negative	i pre_- ordered gta_v with shopto - it was my first order with them despite creating an account some time ago .
negative	since creating that account i ' d moved_house - with this being my first order the shopto website said my item would be delivered to my billing_address for security_reasons , which was fine by me .
negative	when my pre_- order processing email came through it stated my order was to be delivered to my delivery address which was now out of date since i created the account some time ago .
negative	so i contacted them to address the issue .
negative	it took 0 messages for them to finally admit their mistake and each time they simply ' stone - walled ' me with assertions that the order was in processing so there was nothing they could do .
negative	but once they finally realised they were at fault they ' miraculously ' could do something and cancelled the order and offered a refund .
negative	which is fine ... although , 0 week_later i '_ve still not been refunded and will likely have to chase this up to make_sure it happens .
negative	review regarding a go pro hero 0 black motor edition ordered on the 00 / 00 /_0000 yes 0000 , not posted due to me mentioning one christian name who sent me an email and speaking honestly !, nonetheless less they still have my money and i , nearly 00 months later do not have the goods , come on proviation get your act_together and give me what is mine !

negative	there is nothing cheap and cheerful about easyjet anymore , they just try and scam you at every opportunity .
negative	they have a reduced size hand_luggage which means you ' re screwed over at the check in .
negative	often the cheapest option on screen but in reality you end up paying more - they may come in £_00 - 00 cheaper_than bmi baby / british_airways etc but once you work out all the costs they won_'_t be & even if they are its just such a miserable way to start a trip .
negative	just before_christmas they had a premium eye cream when the order finally arrived it wasn_'_t even that .
negative	after basically being_fobbed_off about the mistake the same cream reappeared on the website at a much higher price , i found the entire handling of the mistake terrible .
negative	i lost all confidence in them and wont be ordering again .
negative	still_haven_'_t received my item an_absolute_joke it '_s been a week nothing had been done about it at all very very very unhappy , i ' d of been happy if someone rang me but no just emails absolute loads of crap
negative	i '_ve been without signal for over 0_weeks now .
negative	originally i thought nothing of it , because i figured any_issues would be solved fairly quickly .
negative	how wrong i was .
negative	i tweeted their " customer_services " team who asked for a postcode .
negative	i gave them it and they provided a vague response that said there was a fault with a mast and they were working to fix it .
negative	0_weeks down the line and many tweets asking for more information have received the same response .
negative	my signal finally came back last friday for about a day ... then a pigeon flew into the mast or something and i '_m left without signal again .
negative	i '_m not happy paying £_00 for this service , so i enquired_about reducing it for this month .
negative	i ended_up on the phone to and indian_call_centre , were the operator could understand me , and i couldn_'_t understand him .
negative	so i gave up .
negative	i was then encouraged by three '_s official twitter_page to file a complaint on their website .
negative	that was a week_ago and i '_ve heard_nothing from them .
negative	i '_ve still got about 00 months on my contract with them , but i '_m more than tempted to fork_out how ever many hundreds of pounds it '_ll cost to be rid of them for good .
negative	disgraceful company .
negative	my wife and i bought a renault koleos from this company and had nothing but grief with it for 0 0 / 0_yrs .
negative	the car was either broken down on our drive or gathering_dust on their plot whilst a bunch of ignorant , arrogant , sales staff and technicians scratched their heads .
negative	not only was the car sold not fit for purpose , there are several issues with this vehicle ( well engine to be more precise ) that we should have been made aware of from the start .
negative	truth is , despite_being a renault dealer , i don_'_t think anyone there new a bloody thing about them .
negative	in 0 0 / 0 years we lost £ 0000 with not a godamn thing to show for it , as a result of this company '_s ignorance , contempt and utter arrogance .
negative	when we placed an order the web_site failed to finalise the payment procedure so we tried a number of times again without_success .
negative	we then found out that four paments had been taken from the bank_account .
negative	we received an email_confirming that the duplicated payment would be refunded but we have now strated to receive the duplicated items by post .
negative	we have not been able to contact the company so my recommendation would be to shop elsewhere .
negative	laura jones
negative	i would strongly_recommend for people i know not to order from your company as my order has still not arrived and had no communication from yourselfs as to why this is .
negative	i ordered 0 pairs of glasses which arrived on 0 / 0 , neither of which i could see clearly through .
negative	i need glasses for reading and viewing a computer_screen .
negative	i needed vari - focal lens .
negative	this option was not available when i ordered the glasses - it was a choice of reading or computer_screen .
negative	there was nothing on the web_site to say i needed to specify vari - focals in the notes .
negative	when i rang glasses_direct the first time , there was no mention of vari - focal_lenses .
negative	i was advised that i cold have one pair for reading and one pair for use on a computer .
negative	it was only when i rang back on 00 / 0 that the option of vari - focals was mentioned .
negative	in the end i have returned your glasses and have used a local_optician .
negative	i will now get a personal service and two_pairs of vari - focal_glasses from them are £_00 cheaper_than the price quoted to me on 00 / 0 .
negative	really poor service which has wasted a lot of my time and effort .
negative	i arrived at the odeon cinema with my family , having already bought tickets online .
negative	when we tried to enter the cinema to watch the film i was asked about the age of my son , who is fifteen_years old and we were told he didnt look old enough , even_though he is the biggest in his class .
negative	i was amazed when we were refused_entry because we didnt have i . d .
negative	for him , simply because we never imagined he would need it , what is even more remarkable i was told the rest of my family were ok to go in , and it was suggested that he waited outside until film had finished , at this point we got a refund and have never been back again and now use another cinema .
negative	i sold 0 phones , one was a year_old and they said it was damaged .
negative	offered to send it back to me , how do i no they didnt damage it .
negative	my word against there in the end of the day .
negative	never use envirofone again .
negative	if you omit to fill in a section of the booking form and are prompted to return to complete it , the date automatically reverts to the default_setting - i . e .
negative	today '_s date - without warning .
negative	this happened to me but , fortunately , i checked the confirmation and was able to phone immediately to sort it out .
negative	because i had done so on the same day , ferrsavers waved their change fee but the ferry company still wanted to keep theirs as i hadn_'_t booked direct .
negative	if i hadn_'_t noticed what they had done , i could have arrived at the ferry in a foreign port with no booking and having lost all the cost of the crossing .
negative	when internet booking was relatively new , there might have been an excuse for this .
negative	things have now moved on and such practices are unforgivable .
negative	i was highly disappointed that my trophy arrived broken and i was forced to buy some super_glue to fix the trophy .
negative	i ordered a tv from pixmania through their website , and paid via_paypal .
negative	they realised that their website was wrong and sent me a lower model tv than i had ordered but did not charge me any less .
negative	i obviously refused to accept delivery and requested a full_refund .
negative	i informed paypal that the order had been cancelled and that i was due a full_refund .
negative	pixmania refused a request from paypal for the refund , and one week_later i phoned pixmania to ask where my money was , they told me that i had to drop my paypal_dispute before they would give me my money back , in other words they are trying to blackmail me into dropping the insurance and protection of paypal - thus leaving me wide open to them denying all knowledge of any payment and me being over £_000 out of pocket .
negative	pay_pal have advised me not to drop this dispute or i will lose their protection and that pixmania have to contact paypal , but pixmania are adamant not to contact paypal but maintain their stance of me dropping the dispute .
negative	you have been_warned .
negative	pay more , rather_than deal with these horrors
negative	i got to dover for the 0 . 00 p . m . ferry and was told that i had to pay £_000 . 00 extra as i was carrying goods ( not for commercial gain ) and that unless i paid it i could not travel .
negative	i felt blackmailed into having to pay this and having had to queue for ages at the office i was then told i could not get on the 0 . 00 p . m . ferry and that i would have to wait_until 00 . 00 p . m .!
negative	i kicked up a fuss and finally_managed to get on the 0 . 00 p . m . ferry completely stressed out .
negative	coming_back i booked onto the 0 . 00 a . m . ferry but it took so long to get from the booking area to the dockside that i missed the 0 , 00 a . m . ferry and had to wait for the 0 . 00 a . m .
negative	ferry !!!
negative	the organisation was appalling .
negative	looks_like gameseek . co . uk is just another scam site , after waiting for a delivery ( or at_least of information about the item being dispatched ) for more than a week , i have tried to contact them using web form on their website , then by calling them directly ... no luck phone is always busy , form doesn_'_t look working ant all :( so guys .. just be careful you can lose money as well
negative	made a review earlier , had apologies and now today '_s booking hasn_'_t turned_up .
negative	i am not shocked , interparcel is really struggling at the moment .
negative	best to go_elsewhere whilst they sort themselves out .
negative	two prepaid cards , neither worked , cannot get any reply from seller .
negative	last_week i was telephoned by someone from zenith home improvements .
negative	on asking the person why they hadn_'_t consulted the tps list , they accused me of being rude .
negative	i asked for my name to be removed from their list .
negative	about half an_hour later i received another call from this company ( a different person ); a similar conversation ensued .
negative	today i received yet another cold call from them .
negative	i am reporting this company to the tps .
negative	they have succeeded in ensuring that i shall never do_business with them should i need the services of a home improvements company in the future .
negative	i ordered 0 towels for collection from local pick - up .
negative	i was texted , and went to collect .... but only 0 towels were in the package , with a note saying 0 were packed and 0 to follow .
negative	the website said nothing about the missing towel .
negative	i gave it 0_weeks and called customer_services ... they said someone would ring me .
negative	they rang a few_days_later , and said that the towels were out - of - stock .... and offered to refund the towel to my c - card .
negative	i left it 0_weeks , no refund .. checked the website , and it now said the missing towel was delivered , and signed for , with the others .
negative	called again to chase my refund ... they said to wait another 0_weeks , and they now had to call track and trace to see where the item was .
negative	waited another 0_weeks ... still no refund ... chap on phone was very rude as i paid by card , and not on account " how can you have purchased from us if you dont have an account number ?"
negative	then said he needs to call track and trace ... who did i speak to before .. they shouldn_'_t have told me to wait .. will call back later today ...
negative	... guess_what ... no call back ... still no refund ...
negative	absolutely_useless .. no idea what they are doing .... please don_'_t use them ever .....
negative	i '_ve bought tickets from your website for the europa league final , i need these before tuesday as i travel to amsterdam on that day and the seller is yet to have posted the tickets !!
negative	!
negative	the fact i have payed £_000 + for 0 tickets and the seller cant be_bothered to post them out totally_unacceptable
negative	transaction_id - 0000000

negative	their product does not work well .
negative	the instructions they give you for their site are not even written for the software they provide you with
negative	they signed me up for an annual service and never tell you it is a two year contract .
negative	just read all the other reviews on them .
negative	i can only think that the couple of positive_reviews are written by themselves .
negative	as i said , i did not know it was a two year contract as they never mentioned it at all .
negative	to add_insult to injury they have now charged me for the 0nd year , only 0 months in to the first year .
negative	they said they sent a letter which was a notice to charge my card 0_weeks_ago but this is not true .
negative	they are in breach of contract
negative	they would not talk to me on the phone - a lady_called lynne fletcher who is the renewals manager : tel : 00000000000 refused to speak to me , leaving her subordinate under her direction to inform_me to fill in their online complaints form ( which is worrying that they would need one anyway !!!)
negative	on the complaints form i asked her to call me but she just replied_saying they were not in the wrong and just to email her if i was not happy .
negative	i have now approached hsbc to refund my transaction .
negative	if you have had similar problems , please report them at first to citizens_advice on + 00 ( 0 ) 000 000 0000 , it only take a few minutes and the more complaints they get , the more likely it is these_guys will stop ripping_people off .
negative	following the sites payment system breakdown , i asked to be told when it would be up and running , so that i could pay for my order .
negative	nobody contacted me
negative	once tried never to be repeated dreadful quality .
negative	as a new father i tried to do my bit , arranging everything we needed once we had choosen what to buy .
negative	i came_across bambino direct and their prices were competetive , their web_site did not suggest anything was out of stock so i ordered over £_000 worth of stuff .
negative	thats when it all went wrong , buggy and high chair quick to arrive , but much needed raincover for our phil and ted '_s sport never arrived .
negative	many telephone_calls and emails just resulted_in apologies and empty_promises on their behalf .
negative	i ended_up being caught out in the rain trying to get our little one off to sleep and had to resort to removing my coat and getting drenched to try and keep buggy and baby dry .
negative	there are obviosly much more in depth details to this unfortunate experience but needless to say for me it spoilt what should have been one of the happiest occasions in my life , just bringing me stress and hassle with their incompetance .
negative	my only advice would be to shop elsewhere and save yourselves the stress and heartache this company is likely to bring you .
negative	item was bought well in advance to be taken_away to university by my daughter .
negative	sadly boohoo '_s incompetence kept the item moving around their depots but never getting to me or even contacting me .
negative	despite_numerous_emails all you get is a generic computer reply saying they will get back to you ; they don_'_t .
negative	they have no readily_available phone number so they seem to deter customers from actually speaking to them .
negative	i managed to track down a number via internet_searches of complaint sites ..
negative	when i finally spoke to a person the product arrived soon after but still many days late .
negative	needless to say with such incompetence as the norm i will not use them again ..
negative	still trying to call customer_services to find when i can go to the depot to get my parcel but gave up after 00_minutes of automated rubbish .
negative	they can '_t even tell you how many people are in the queue in front of you .
negative	the website is equally useless at trying to find where your parcel is .
negative	i will not willingly use this company .
negative	flowers were delivered for my wife for mothers_day with no issues , however two_days_later all the roses have died , the greenery is limp and the lilies are wilting .
negative	i have bought bouquets from morrisons for a quarter of the price that have lasted four times longer before dying .
negative	bought three bouquets this week for a value of £_00 so really not happy and don_'_t think i will order off serenata again
negative	it all went well at the start of me selling my old_mobile_phones , quick to send out the packs for me to send the mobiles back in .
negative	i was recycling 0 old_phones , one of them was my old_blackberry .
negative	i had just been given an upgrade and wanted to get some cash for my old " working " phone .
negative	i was offered a good price for it and sent it in .
negative	two_days_later i was told they couldn_'_t give my the set price as my phone had got water_damage !!!!!!
negative	it has never been damaged or in water .
negative	i asked for the phone to be sent back to me , i was then offered a lot less for the phone as it was considered to be " not working " i asked for the item to be returned to me .
negative	it was returned and funny enough it switched on with no damage , no damage to the screen , nothing !!!!!!!!
negative	so be aware sellers , be aware !
negative	!
negative	rented a car and when i turned_up at location the said information on website was not correct .. the information from carhire0000 was incorrect but they still charged me a £_00 booking_fee .. rip - off company !
negative	a clone of pc_world website ... and only has same costing as store .
negative	the internet should make products cheaper but with delivery this makes their website more_expensive and slower_than just simply going to the store .
negative	find the site cluttered and a clone of msn ... and the search_engine is lagging behing google in every sense ... useless when you consider msn is run by microsoft , why exist as a multi - million_pound company when your search is behind google , bing and ask and your content is behind msn .. yahoo should strike out to make itself more unique ..
negative	all i can say is , what a shocking customer experience .
negative	ordered online expecting the product to arrive in 0 - 0 days .
negative	oh no , 00 weeks_later it has just turned_up .
negative	constantly fobbed_off with , " oh it '_s due in stock in early april ", then the same for may and june .
negative	i have to say that i will never buy from you again , i will stick with wiggle etc .
negative	what makes this worse , is there was never a single apology when i emailed them .
negative	rubbish service at it '_s best !!!!
negative	!
negative	we have been with fu for just over a year now , and twice in the past year , we have not only been accused of not paying our bill , but on several_occasions have failed to even receive a bill .
negative	we received plenty of correspondence when they thought we hadn_'_t paid our bill , when we rang them up about the latter , after confirming with the bank that it had been paid , they told us the money had been paid and they informed us that they never said we hadn_'_t paid it , even_though we had been receiving letters from solicitors acting on their behalf claiming we hadn_'_t paid it .
negative	we have now got another solicitors letter claiming that once again we have not paid them £_000 . 00 when in actual fact we have paid it and are in possession of receipts proving this , will be ringing them on monday and recording any calls we exchange .
negative	its an_absolute travesty and we are seriously_considering switching providers .

negative	i placed an order of shoes which went ok .
negative	i recommended to a friend and he bought a padel racket .
negative	0 week delay , a match lost a 0 phone_calls took to actually get the racket .
negative	very poor customer service .
negative	0 times canceled for no reson
negative	told a week to deliver my example album , i will admit that it was good and cheap , but very very very slow
negative	my particular purchase was very poor quality and looked just awful .
negative	it was very cheap , but even so i did expect better ( as i had used this shop before ).
negative	complete_waste of money .
negative	flying out to a wedding on may 0rd and guess_what ... our flight was cancelled and opodo booked as another flight that was 0 hours_later !!
negative	we have to wait in paris for 0 hrs whereas we booked it specifically for only a 0 hour wait ... obviously we will miss the wedding !
negative	now i have been on the phone for the last 00_mins trying to call their customer service line which costs . 00 cents a minute !!
negative	!
negative	all i hear is their terrible hold music ... which i can describe as being even more painful than waiting and knowing my money is going down the drain .
negative	you suck opodo ... never using you ever again .

negative	got on the coach and showed our paperwork the driver said it was not the resort_hopper coach , we waited longer and the coach left , we rang the office and they said the coach has_been and we were not there but get a taxi and the coach will wait for us , when we got to the coach it was the same driver , spent a lot of time and effort trying to make an official_complaint but the result was they believed the spanish coach driver and not me , would love to hear his version of what happened , he made no attempt to check a passenger list lucky we did not miss our flight
negative	i have never dealt_with this company and i must_say it was a nightmare .
negative	the experience i had i would not wish it on my worse enemy .
negative	where do i start , i had a parcel coming from barcelona to the uk , guaranteed to be here 0 - 0 days .
negative	it took me 00 days to receive it .
negative	they kept on delaying my scheduled days .
negative	baring in mind i do have a life and work full time .
negative	then i get a call to say the post_code was wrong and would have it delivered on this day .
negative	i called the sender and they sent me proof of the postcode being correct .
negative	i get a call back from the representative 00_minutes later , saying it has to be sent back to their depot in london and does not know when it will be delivered .
negative	i then demanded to speak to a manager where he then put the phone down .
negative	this is the reason_why the call you on private number .
negative	there system online to track your parcel is useless , they did not even update it for when the parcel will be delivered to me , so i missed the first delivery on the 00th day .
negative	i hope to never deal with these_people again .
negative	so if you would like to deal with this company these are the benefits :
negative	* unprofessional
negative	* liars
negative	* incompetent
negative	* misleading

negative	måned for at få afklaring på mystiske regninger .
negative	skal også ringe for at få voicemail afmeldt .
negative	flyttede 0 telefonnumre med aftale om : 0 timers taletid og 0 gb datatid - jeg_fik 000_mb datatid .
negative	har sendt den oprindelige aftale ind til tdc 0 gange_og_det_er stadig ikke rettet .....
negative	elendig service ....
negative	jeg skifter selskab nu ...!
negative	har_ikke prøvet noget tilsvarende !
negative	ordered a fridge drawer (£_00 . 00 ) on a thursday_lunchtime to replace a broken item and paid for next_day delivery (£ 0 . 00 ) as i was on leave the following_day to receive the delivery , but was back at work the following week and would not be at home for delivery .
negative	the booking was followed up with a dispatch confirmation stating that the item has_been dispatched from the distribution_centre at_0000hrs on friday_morning .
negative	the item didnt arrive until the following_monday at_0000hrs a full 0 days after ordering - hardly next_day is it partmaster ?
negative	0 complaint emails later requesting that they refund the difference_between 0st_class and next_day delivery charge which i think is fair , but this company will not even show the courtesy to reply which says what they think about their customers .
negative	it is now 0 days since i sent my first complaint email to their customer_services team and i '_m still_waiting for a reply despite a follow_up reminder to them .
negative	think_twice before using partmaster , they ’ re good at taking your order and your money , but they will not respond to dissatisfied_customers .
negative	i will never use them again .
negative	i am not going to write reams here as i have already done that in a complaint to this company on the 00th_feb which apart_from a standard email back they have not had the decency to repsond to , even their own status on the complaint has changed to critical without response so it shows you what they care about their customers satisfaction .
negative	in a nutshell and much like other reviews i have just read here the flowers received were worse than you can pick_up at a supermarket or petrol_station forecourt , just a whole lot more_expensive , most of the flowers were way past their best and i was very disappointed and slightly_embarrassed .
negative	they also did not provide the card i chose and instead used one with gift_card on the front when i had chosen a valentines one .
negative	if you read this and are thinking of ordering with this company then please take the best advice possible and order elsewhere , whatever the occassion you want flowers for then do not let this company take your money and ruin the occassion .
negative	my wife '_s anniversary flowers turned_up 00_hours after they were dispatched 0000
negative	my neighbour took them in , when we came home today they were dreadful she said they turned_up after 0pm and looked the worst for wear
negative	i am not happy that i spent a substantial_amount on these flowers and they are rubbish
negative	it ' seems that to travel 0 miles takes 00hrs , do you deliver with a tractor
negative	my anniversary was over by the time they arrived
negative	i will not be ordering with you again
negative	pictures are available if you want them
negative	very upset john
negative	i paid a premier service for a shipment from us to uk and here are some interesting discoveries i have made with the tracking no .
negative	0 .
negative	it takes 0 days for the parcel to be delivered to uk by usps for a 0000 mile long journey .
negative	0 .
negative	it takes 0 days for the uk custom to clear it .
negative	0 .
negative	it takes 0 days and ticking for parcelforce to deliver custom notice with the depot 0 miles from my doorstep .
negative	they are also shameless enough to charge an 0 pound process fee for that .
negative	it is safely say this company has all the incompetent and ignorant sides of royal_mail which in turn is usually an excellent service provider .
negative	the miracle of their survival is totally based on the unfair competition of using the royal_mail ’_s existing network and infrastructures which are not available to other very hardworking , organized and responsive services .
negative	they won_’_t survive for a day without the support of royal_mail given the service they provide and the fee they charge .
negative	in short , they are shite !
negative	the reason_why people find this company useful is when they try to sort_out the lowest_price this company usually pops_up .
negative	however , they are cheap for a reason .
negative	they don_'_t have their logistic supply chains , thus they don_'_t get a hold of the goods they sell .
negative	all they do is they phone a real supplier company and let them ship the goods .
negative	as you would imagine , buying process could become more complicated with extra parties_involved .
negative	if crescentelectronic can ’_t acquire your order they will just send you a preformatted email_telling you they don_’_t have that in stock leaving you wondering what about those stock numbers ?
negative	don_'_t you never ever trust their stock numbers , they are all wrong and they want it that way so that you can prepay confidently .
negative	surely they know orders will most_likely get delayed and they even have preformatted emails to explain that .
negative	if you are not a few quids short , do not buy from this company , especially you are buying for a production environment .
negative	they can get you fired .
negative	their rma process is problematic as well .
negative	i bought 0 wd re0 0tb enterprise class hard_disks for a raid0 array built .
negative	with a very rare luck , 0 of them are dead on arrival .
negative	the rma went on well until the replacement disks arrived a few weeks_later .
negative	first of all , the disks are not sent by crescent electronic and are sent by another company - the actual supplier of the disks .
negative	second of all , the supplier company sent some overall 00 pounds_cheaper caviar wd blue 0tb consumer class disks for replacements ( we will call this company the 0nd company for short ).
negative	correct me if i am wrong , people generally would expect to get a bmw 0 series back if they send in a bmw 0 series for replacements , wouldn_'_t they ?
negative	well , i got lucky and i got a vauxhall_astra back !
negative	i phoned the 0nd company trying to tell them how ridicilous is that and a young_girl in her 00s picked_up the phone telling_me “ those enterprise disks are out of stock so they decided to send me these ”.
negative	from the fair natural way she talks about it i decided not to argue with the people with the wrong logic to start with .
negative	it is not my responsibility to stop them from destroying themselves .
negative	i contacted the crescent electronic again to get things sorted .
negative	with countless_emails , waiting and worrying for a month and a half i finally got my refund .
negative	this is really a classic scenario when things go_wrong , you would be left in this time and money wasting triangle relationship crescent electronic has very successfully implied .
negative	i felt that with this sort of experience a 0_star would be an overstatement , 0_star would be proper .
negative	however , with the fact that i got the refund i will give them 0 extra star , no more .
negative	0000 00 00 update ,
negative	i revised the 0_star_rating to 0_star as crescentelectronic is trying to cover up my very honest review .
negative	i ordered 0 bottles of aftershave .
negative	after 00 days i still hadn_'_t received my order , i messaged them and they told me to wait a further 00 days .
negative	i did that and still no delivery .
negative	ive tried messaging them twice since then and they are clearly ignoring my messages .
negative	awful company ... even worse customer service !
negative	had a claim in since last october , at last in april they say they have sent a payment to my paypal_account ----- but they haven_'_t ( 00 days_later ).
negative	i sold a tyre to some one and they ordered collection through you ref_:_0000000 , first day many promises but no collection , tell a lie when he telephone you your driver said there was now one in at collection address , well i saw him drive down the road , stop and reverse up again i tried to flag him down but he was on his way home , so he is a bloody liar !!!!
negative	next_day collection promised , no collection , next_day collection promised now 00 . 00 so we '_ll see .
negative	a very frustrating experience .
negative	web_site stated " in stock , delivery five days ".
negative	ordered 00st november but eventually despatched direct from supplier on 0th , arriving 0th_december after several e_- mails with false_promises .
negative	web_site gives a phone number but you get a recorded_message_stating all communication must be by e_- mail .
negative	eventually_managed to find an_alternative phone number on facebook and was able to talk to staff .
negative	again broken_promises initially but persistence got results .
negative	noted other customers had frustrations with broken delivery promises .
negative	phone number is 00000_000000 .
negative	to get this crb take few weeks ?
negative	fill it up few form and then i get by post another one .
negative	i lost my money , i dont_know nothing else .
negative	how long i can want for one paper .
negative	constantly hangs - particularly after advert breaks .
negative	almost unwatchable .
negative	do they even care about the appalling service they are providing to the public ?
negative	apparently not .
negative	anyone can give less for less money .
negative	there is no value in tesco and no respect for customers .
negative	it is a pure money_grabbing operation .
negative	and i know someone_who chauffeured the directors .
negative	my wife discovered an item on her till receipt that she did not buy .
negative	the store manager made her wait standing at customer_services for over an_hour while he went and checked cctv which happened to show she never entered the aisle with the expensive product she had been charged for was stocked .
negative	a refund with no hint of apology followed .
negative	every little hurts as this monster forces smaller shops off the high_street and makes other supermarkets drag their values and quality down to compete with tesco '_s base levels .
negative	item ( an sds_drill ) arrived with inadequate and torn packaging .
negative	when opened there were bits and paperwork ( reg docs etc_.)
negative	missing i ' d normally expect to find and the manual had been thumbed through .
negative	it looked like a customer or catalogue return or ex - demo to me , plus it did not arrived sealed from the courier so who was to know .
negative	charlies_direct refunded , but they didn_'_t like it and were quite snooty and unapologetic .
negative	their customer rep claimed to be doing me a favour by not making a charge for returning the item to them as they did not regard it as faulty .
negative	i suspect they only fully refunded to try and not get bad feedback , but john_lewis they ain '_t .
negative	i will not be buying from them again .
negative	i booked and had confirmed a double double deluxe room for 0 adults and a child .
negative	when i arrived i was told i only had a double no deluxe , that would mean all 0 of us in one bed ... cosy .
negative	fortunately the staff at the hotel were very good and got me another room with no extra_charge , but still we didn_'_t get our deluxe rooms as promised .
negative	very poor show from eurobookings and i definitely won_'_t use them again .
negative	flowers didnt arrive .
negative	these_people have various flashy websites suggesting they have excellent customer service however they don_'_t .
negative	they don_'_t seem to be able to deliver when their website promises and they don_'_t seem to be aware of their broken_promises .
negative	i ordered goods which didn_'_t turn_up despite having taken the day off ( unpaid ).
negative	when i chased the order they blame the supplier ( their problem not mine ) and they seemed totally_unaware of the fact they had broken their side of the bargain and cost me a day '_s pay into the bargain .
negative	i cancelled the order which happily they did refund .
negative	howveer the really funny part is that they then delivered the thing a few_days_later but seemed totally_unaware of until i asked them why they had done that .
negative	they then wanted me to take another day off work to wait in for their courier to collect it !
negative	lost my parcel . not concerned in anyway offered £_00 go direct to courier these third_party firms offer no cover of lost
negative	so i joined on an 00 month_contract , mobile_broadband device / myfi , it '_s the dongle that lets you connect up 0 separate devices to it at any one time , around £_00 per_month including_vat .... sounds great right ?
negative	errrrm no !
negative	i had issues maybe a 0 - 0 times a month and for a week at a time .
negative	connection would stop , signal would fail and here '_s the catch , anytime i called customer service i would spend maybe 00_minutes a time talking to people who honestly didn_'_t care , couldn_'_t help , asked me to reset my device then passed me on to someone_else .
negative	i '_ve been left flabbergasted at some of the lame_excuses & responses i got from people who shouldn_'_t work in customer_support roles - they didn_'_t have a clue !
negative	i '_m not sure what database or system they use but like other customers have said , nothing seems to be recorded so everyone i get passed to , i have to explain the whole situation again from_start to finish ... how frustrating !!
negative	but on top of that , by the end of my phone_call , no one has ever been able to help or resolve my issues !
negative	pretty_much no one really cared !
negative	this is not about a call_centre being in india , there are many companies with great call_centres abroad in india and other_countries ... this is about a call_centre with staff who don_'_t care , maybe don_'_t have the right training , maybe are not set any targets or are not monitored or just don_'_t get feedback about their poor performance .
negative	however i can '_t blame the call_centre staff as its the companies job to install values , ways of working & expectations !!
negative	for this reason the senior members , directors , ceo '_s , owners should be_ashamed of how you run your business and what you see as acceptable ... you may think you have a great product but just read all your poor reviews week after week .... surely you have some integrity , some part of you that says " hold up , something really is wrong here " ???
negative	you work in an industry where customers should be the most_important part of everything you do !
negative	without us , you will lose out in the long run !
negative	just look at how many people have said that they will never use you again , or who want to cancel their contracts .... still you do nothing .
negative	i '_m currently a three customer , not out of choice but because you make it so hard for me to cancel , however my contract is up in 0 months and let_me tell you , ill celebrate that date when it arrives and then take my custom and hard_earned_money somewhere_else , to a provider that actually values me !
negative	i '_m_sure it won_'_t be too long before you all come unstuck .... good luck with that !
negative	oh & to any other customer who is thinking_about joining three for broadband or a dongle or even myfi ..... please don_'_t !
negative	you will not just regret it , it will frustrate you for the entire length of your contract !!!
negative	oh & guess_what my new months data_allowance was meant to start today !
negative	0th of every_month .... but you guessed it !
negative	yep , it doesn_'_t work .... no_surprises there .
negative	no one at three will care because i '_ve paid already !
negative	great business model they have !
negative	absolute bunch of clowns !
negative	this is the second delivery within a month that has_gone to the wrong street and left without a signature .
negative	surely checking the address is correct is a delivery man training school fundamental .
negative	dreadful service .
negative	truly_awful .
negative	bought 00 boxes as i thought only to have 0 delivered , apparently when you order something which comes in a pack of 0 and you order 0 , you only get 0 boxes .
negative	wouldn_'_t really mind but £_00 for 0 cardboard_boxes is outrageous .
negative	after 00 days from order i still have no my items , delivery failed , my money are lost
negative	i have posted two reviews on this company .
negative	i would advise you not to trust them .
negative	i purchased an expensive toaster , which had a large mark on the stainless_steel .
negative	they accepted it was defective by e_- mail after i sent photographs and said they would replace .
negative	they then told me when i chased up that they had not stock ( despite the website showing the item as available ).
negative	when they could not tell me when they would get stock i asked for a refund .
negative	miraculously then stock became_available .
negative	they said they could send it that day , then that it had missed the van .
negative	when i chased again they said that they had received one toaster and it had been sent to someone_else .
negative	this is incredible - it seems that they may have lied about stock to prevent a refund .
negative	they also attempted to renege on the agreement to accept the product was defective .
negative	they are now collecting the defective toaster and have agreed to refund , but they are plainly untrustworthy and i would urge that you do not buy from them .
negative	i am considering reporting them to trading_standards , principally because of the apparent lie .
negative	i ordered an offside front sun_visor for a maxus van , costing_£_00 . 00 .
negative	i was sent a near side front sun_visor .
negative	when i phoned and told them , i was told they will fit either side as thy are not handed .
negative	this was incorrect .
negative	on a second conversation they said , to return the item and they would send me the correct one .
negative	once again i phoned as nothing had arrived , only to be told they had not got one and they would return my money which now stands at £_00 . 00 due to me paying for
negative	the return .
negative	so_far i have not received anything
negative	arrived on time which was a plus .
negative	but when i put the costume together i discovered that the inflatable had a hole in .
negative	why sell these products without checking them first ?
negative	disgrace .
negative	increased my direct_debit from under £_000 to over £ 0000 per_month without contact to say why , £ 0000 in credit with them but overdrawn at bank !!
negative	took two_days to get to speak to real_person on phone , then got six email messages , most duplicates about complaints_procedure which they had already closed .
negative	had to wait on phone on hold for ages to actually get confirmation our debit had been amended to original and money was being repaid to my bank , apparently takes up to ten working_days but i note it came out quick enough .
negative	received bed and the side_panels where damaged and assembly pack was missing , phoned up and was told that the items will be dispatched . side_panels arrived but the assembly kit was missing so phoned up again to be told it will have to be sent again . finally received assembly kit and two of the bolts were missing i didn_'_t bother phoning up because i was fed_up having the bed for so long i went and purchased the two bolts myself .
negative	overall disappointed is a understatement !
negative	flowers arrived on time , but the roses were wilted and has brown marks all over them .
negative	the lily '_s were too young ( took 0 days to open by which time the roses were dead ), and the greenery had brown marks .
negative	all in all the quality was terrible .
negative	i tried to call their customers services but after an_hour on hold i gave up .
negative	they only got in contact when i opened a paypal_dispute .
negative	their customer service is a nightmare to deal with .
negative	they refused to rectify the situation .
negative	they say they have a 0 day satisfaction_guarantee but they don_'_t honour this !!!
negative	!
negative	if your thinking of buying flowers from them dont , do yourself a favour an pop along to your local_supermarket or garage the quality is much_better_than you get from prestige_flowers and it '_s allot cheaper !!
negative	!
negative	will never ever use again !
negative	response to below
negative	i did try calling several_times but gave up because no one ever answered , same with emails .
negative	the only time you got in contact was when i raised a paypal claim !
negative	i looked for the online_chat but couldn_'_t find it anywhere !
negative	if you google prestigeflowers reviews you will clearly see they don_'_t answer phone or emails and generally give a terrible service .
negative	so where '_s my free upgraded flowers ?
negative	when i did finally hear from you all you did was make excuses and say anything to get out of sending replacement flowers .
negative	even thought the bunch of flowers you sent were so bad they looked like they had been picked out of the bin !
negative	the roses were wilted and had brown spots all over them , the greenery also had brown spots and now after 0 days they lily '_s have finally open they are white when the ones pictured were two tone pink !
negative	you seem very quick to take peoples money and send them rubbish , but very slow to do anything about it and in my experience you won_'_t do anything other than try and cover yourselves with the fairytale you wrote below .
negative	i did follow your complaints_procedure and you have done nothing but make excuses .
negative	if anyone doesn_'_t believe what i '_m saying please feel free to contact me i have document everything , have photo '_s etc showing what a bunch of cowboys prestige_flowers are .
negative	*********************** update update update ******************************
negative	got a full_refund :) i paid with paypal so when prestigeflowers customer service wasn_'_t giving me any joy i raised a complain case with paypal and explained what had happened , then prestigeflowers gave their explanation and paypal decided in my favour and i got a full_refund !
negative	so if you have bought from prestigeflowers . co . uk and you want a refund go directly to paypal and make a complaint .
negative	this review is true and accurate , if you want proof please contact me and i will be happy to provide .
negative	placing orders is easy especially repeat_orders online however when it comes to customer service the contact , attitude and approach makes you realise your money should have been spent elsewhere
negative	over the last few_months i have had multiple breakages , cleaners showing up when no booking made confirmed phone bookings not being logged on system so i wasted a whole morning waiting for a cleaner that they forgot to book .
negative	i was promised a phone_call from a manager which i never got , which just shows how much they really care .
negative	today my confirmed appointment never bothered to show up , and they had no idea why .
negative	rubbish customer service .
negative	if you '_ve got time to waste and are happy to constantly chase the company then go for it .
negative	this is the most unacceptable company i have come_accross .
negative	they never phone when they say they will , scare you about unretrievable data , take your money when infact very little has_been done and never return the hardware sent .
negative	trading_standards must get involved .
negative	having been a lifelong user of inter_flora , i thought i ' d give eflorist a chance .
negative	i placed two orders ; one for a work_colleague who ' d just had a baby and the other to my partner who was recovering from an accident .
negative	for the first one , i received a call on behalf of the florist to say the driver was lost .. could i confirm the address and telephone_number of recipient .
negative	no_problems with either ...
negative	i had phoned recipient to make_sure she was at home and address was clear and easy to find .
negative	however , beyond wit of ' courier ' driver to deliver ... so delivery promised next_day and eflorist refunded my same day delivery fee .
negative	but it wasn_'_t delivered the next_day ( saturday ) because driver screwed_up again .
negative	so now eflorist asking that recipient phone them so they can phone florist to sort things out - two or three_days late .
negative	next ... flowers for my partner .
negative	order placed at 0pm ... delivered nearly 0pm .
negative	i understand florists get busy , but the bouquet was nothing like picture .
negative	when i pointed this out , eflorist told me picture was for illustration only .
negative	but really ... what we received compared to what we were promised were worlds apart .
negative	inner flora do have their problems , but they also seem to have quality controls that eflorist appear not to apply .
negative	i spent_nearly_£_000 on two bouquets and gifts ... they ( or the florists employed ) muffed both orders up .
negative	i never ever had that with inter_flora ... guess who i '_ll be using in the future .
negative	last_week i bought tickets to bruno mars concert for me and my family .
negative	we will travel to dubai tomorrow to attend the concert on april 00 .
negative	i thought i would have the tickets after i click the purchase button .
negative	but i never got the tickets .
negative	on the viagogo website it only said that my ticket purchases were " pending confirmation ".
negative	according to their terms and conditions , i should know for sure within 00_hours if i have tickets or not .
negative	well , it has_been 0 days so_far and still it is pending confirmation .
negative	i sent them several emails but all replies were vague and unhelpful .
negative	i tried_calling but nobody ever answers .
negative	i called my bank who informed me there is some unsafe activity on the credit_card so it had to be cancelled .
negative	i sent an email to viagogo to inform them of this , that it has_been more than 00_hours and no confirmed ticket , so consider the order cancelled .
negative	they replied by telling_me that i cannot cancel !!
negative	in other words i do not have any rights !!
negative	how is this possible ?
negative	i was not provided with the tickets within 00_hrs , and there was no payment transaction , so how can i not cancel ?
negative	i have never come_across this type of abuse of customer rights .
negative	i do not want the tickets !
negative	this has_been traumatic experience !
negative	buy perfume , told dispatched , then told not in stock and refunded - but took days to do !!!!!!!!!!!!!!
negative	!
negative	when i first queried my bill , i got a letter from them some time later which stated that they could not accept my initial meter_reading ( though i had never queried it , i had told them that their end of bill reading was wildly too high ).
negative	i phoned to complain , but found that i was ` no .
negative	00 in a queue '.
negative	i then sent a written letter of complaint by post , but received no reply whatsoever .
negative	a couple of weeks_later re - sent the letter as an attachment to the complaints form on their web - site , but still received no reply .
negative	now given up expecting any reply and have switched to another supplier - life '_s too short !
negative	i had a package arranged for this morning between 0 and 00 .
negative	i had the day off of work so waited in my front room for the hour , knowing that i would see the van turn_up .
negative	it never arrived .
negative	instead , i received an insulting text_message hours_later informing_me that the delivery had been rejected by the recipient .
negative	i phoned asos immediately to confirm the delivery address was correct , to which they confirmed correctly , and then passed me on to this abhorrent company .
negative	i spent 00_minutes speaking to automated messages before trying my luck with a different team that i found on the website .
negative	the woman , mandy , seemed not to care and passed me through to the ' customer_care ' team .
negative	care - ha !
negative	i was on hold for 00_minutes before giving up .
negative	i then found this website with many a 0_star_review on it .
negative	i saw that an email address was recommended by members of the company on here - i thought great , that should provide some answers .
negative	hours_later and the apparently ' always manned ' email address has sent no reply , despite me sending my consignment_number and contact telephone_number .
negative	i needed this parcel as i '_m going on holiday tomorrow morning .
negative	useless bunch of cowboys , avoid at all costs .
negative	and don_'_t you dare respond to this saying ' send us an email ' - i know for a fact you won_'_t reply .
negative	the most unprofessional company it '_s ever been my displeasure to deal with .
negative	any trumped up excuse to reduce the originally_quoted value of recycled phones .
negative	not trustworthy .
negative	i had a bad_experience ordering an item worth £_000 .
negative	i was told the estimated delivery date , - no delivery .
negative	i emailed ' care @ superdry ', - no response after 0 week .
negative	i phoned superdry , - they re - sent the item , but to the wrong_address .
negative	i have formally complained to see what they would do by way of compensating me , no response .
negative	i phoned them and they confirmed that they did get my emails , but have been busy with a back log of work .
negative	thats very well , but what a fool i looked in front of my girlfriend when i couldn_'_t give her her anniversary_gift .
negative	i suppose i '_m the fool for relying on superdry to deliver my item within a 0 week period .
negative	still have had no call or apology , but hey , i guess my custom isn_'_t worth their time after all .
negative	so i won_'_t be going back .
negative	do not trust this company , 0 months waiting for a part , 0 email 0_weeks_ago to say part was " in transit " where from the far side of the bloody galaxy ?
negative	phone now cut_off , will not respond to emails or faxs i say again !!!!!
negative	do not trust your hard_earned_money to these robbing bastards are you reading this des coffey ??????
negative	?
negative	i booked the wrong tickets due to the website displaying incorrect booking summary details before i purchased !
negative	when checking my tickets after i had paid for them , the booking summary stated it was same day return .
negative	the initial booking summary before i paid for them did not say this .
negative	called the contact center to explain the situation , long_story_short , treated with contempt from astonishingly rude manager and told a refund would still cost £_00 , despite my wrong booking being their fault due to errors on the website .
negative	yet another company contributing to rip_off britain !
negative	the manager , sean , should be_ashamed of him self .
negative	in the end i was able to use virgin_trains website , who also do not charge booking_fees and display booking summary information accurately before you pay .
negative	i have emailed redspottedhanky a complaint so i will update in due course .
negative	when leaving t - mobile i was told i didn_'_t need to give notice to leave .
negative	they then charged me a early_termination fee .
negative	this was before i had even left t - mobile !
negative	i only spoke to some one trying to retain me and told them i wanted to leave !
negative	i '_m now with tesco who have much_cheaper packages and only english call_centres .
negative	t - mobile is now known as ee so avoid them and get a better deal with tesco , talk_talk or 0 .
negative	i purchased a 00 * 0 self assemble polycarbonate greenhouse in february_0000 .
negative	the assembly was quite difficult .
negative	when it was completed i was very pleased with the product .
negative	after two years small holes appeared in the top layer of the roof which did not cause a problem as it did not leak .
negative	the roofing panels slowly became more brittle and have now cracked and distorted and one has blown out despite the roof now being covered with a polythene sheet .
negative	as the greenhouse cost over £_000 i did expect the materials to last longer_than four years before disintegrating .
negative	the company policy is that it has a one year_guarantee and they now have no liability for a faulty product .
negative	there is a glowing write up in their brochure for polycarbonate sheeting but no mention of how long the material should last .
negative	my advice is before buying make_sure you get a guarantee on the materials or you may have money down the drain .
negative	i ordered a tumble_drier to be delivered on the 0rd .
negative	april .
negative	at 00 . 00_hrs on 0rd_april i received an_automated call saying that the appliance would be delivered between 00 . 00_hrs and 00 . 00hrs .
negative	at 00 . 00 as nothing had arrived and i had to go out to a meeting i rang and was informed that the delivery had been delayed and that i had not been notified .
negative	i asked if i could be informed of a delivery time and it was agreed that you would ring back with this info as you could not contact the delivery lorry .
negative	when you rang back you said that it would be about half an_hour as the lorry was 00 miles_away which would take about 00 to 00_minutes .
negative	as i was due at a meeting i asked if you could reschedule the delivery to next_day , i was told that the only way that i could do that was the cancel the order and reorder for next_day delivery with the next_day charges .
negative	i waited_until 00 . 00 when the delivery was made .
negative	the drivers were very apologetic however they said that he order had been cancelled earlier in the day and therefore struck off the delivery list and that they had had to re - route themselves to make the delivery .
negative	very poor service in that it appears that your right hand did not know what your left hand was doing and you committed the cardinal sin of lying to a customer .
negative	i logged a formal_complaint at that time and as of now have had no response as of now .
negative	i paid for expedited service so that i would receive product within 0 - 0 working_days .
negative	i received the products a full week_later .
negative	i emailed to ask for progress but did not receive a reply .
negative	i asked if i could have my " expedited service " fee back , no reply .
negative	i also emailed to ask if there was anything we could do to make me feel better as i had more gear to order , ie small goodwill discount but i did not get a reply either .
negative	will never use again as there is a competitive market for this stuff out there and i will vote with my feet and my wallet .
negative	sorry guys but this is not good enough .
negative	i reserved a car on a rent a car service .
negative	it had to be a minibus mercedes vita , i paid on line and full insurance and extra for tiers and mirrors and for all what could be possible .
negative	when i came to the office to take a car at milano airport bergamo , suddenly i found out that insurance i pied is nothing ; i had to pay for the full insurance to the company 000 eur more and additionally deposit 000 eur .
negative	if i would not they told me that they have to reserve deposit 0000 eur at my account .
negative	then they told me that they do not have mercedes and gave_me a peugeot because mercedes was not returned , it seems to me that they do not have them at all looking at their auto park .
negative	peugeot was almost killed , full of scratches and “ wounds ” not all of them were indicated in the acceptance car list .
negative	when the order was placed i received prompted acknowledgement of the order and assurance that all orders are shipped within 00_hours .
negative	instead a week_later and without_any email shipment notifications i received a note fro the local sorting_office - which is 0 miles_away that a parcel is waiting for me .
negative	eventually i fetched the parcel only to find out that the whole box contained just a flimsy booklet buried among a lot of packing_material .
negative	it also advised that the mail item which were a set of 0 weeded puzzles will be shipped on 00nd_november .
negative	however a week_later , on 00 november i received another note from the royal_mail informing_me that another parcel was waiting for me in the depot .
negative	this time the parcel contained the ordered puzzles .
negative	i would recommend that like everyone_else you should arrange for emails to be sent to your customers informing them of the shipping and who the carries is so that they can arrange for somebody to be home to receive it .
negative	very disappointed
negative	do not use this company !
negative	it seemed like a good deal at first , cheap designer_frames and low_cost lenses but i have problems from the moment i first put them on .
negative	after getting no help from selectspecs i took them to a high_street_opticians and got them to test them for me and even write up a little report that shows of the 0 measurements needed to made a pair of glasses , 0 of theses measurement were different to what i ordered .
negative	so i sent the glasses back to selectspecs along with a letter and the opticians report .
negative	they replied back to say they had tested the glasses in their own lab and they were fine and that if i wasn_'_t happy i should take them to my local_optician to check them , they didn_'_t read my letter !
negative	after getting the glasses returned i sent them another letter saying that if they didn_'_t even read my first letter how was i to believe they even tested the glasses , they replied to say they had sent them tested by an externally and they were correct .
negative	but first they told me they tested them themselves now they say they sent them out , but they only had them for 0 working_days before sending them back to me !
negative	bottom_line is i will be getting my glasses from the high_street in future because with these online companies you ' re okay if they get the glasses right first time , then everything '_s great .
negative	but if they get it wrong they won_'_t admit it and wash their hands of you , probably because their profit_margins are so tight that they can '_t afford to re - do any jobs they botch .
negative	i am leaving o0 today .
negative	the service was , at one point , quite good , but has degraded to the point of being useless .
negative	i have had to endure awful reception , constant texts about other deals and plans ( as if they weren_'_t already leaching enough money from me ) dropped calls , unsent texts , calls being ended abruptly ( often when i '_m in the middle of a sentence ) and , disturbingly often , the complete inability to even make a phone_call in the first place , which , as i am sure you can all agree , rather_defeats the purpose of being a network ; if you can '_t be absolutely certain that your customers will be able to call people on their phones what on earth is the point of trying to provide a service ?
negative	i am now in the process of changing my network to a company who is serious and is not larking about , playing_games and pretending to be a business .
negative	i have had no help and no explanations .
negative	my emails have gone_unanswered .
negative	i could have had a doctor '_s appointment this morning .
negative	i have a host of illnesses i need to sort but because o0 decided to be lazy and useless i now have to wait_until tomorrow .
negative	great .
negative	i rang and rang and i missed the window because my phone outright refused to connect the call .
negative	i am extremely angry .
negative	i am utterly convinced that every_single five - star_review of o0 i read on this site has_been written with the promise of money involved ; i refuse to believe that they are legitimate , and if any of you o0 lackeys are reading this and you ' d like to debate what i '_m saying , go_ahead .
negative	please , i would love to hear you try to defend yourselves .
negative	i could do with a laugh today .
negative	and if you decide that , after_reading this , you no_longer want me as a customer well ...
negative	i don_'_t honestly care .
negative	i blew ten_pounds on a service that i can '_t even use .
negative	oh , and i warn you now that any reply , any kind of response from you will be made public .
negative	i will post it to every_single review site i can find .
negative	trustpilot , yelp , i '_ll post to facebook , i will make everybody i know aware of it .
negative	i promise .
negative	we were so badly_let_down by this company that it almost cost us our own business .
negative	we gave them deadlines and explained that if they could not meet them to just tell us as we had another supplier who could meet them , but we were assured there wouldn_'_t be a problem .
negative	the samples we asked for by a set deadline were missed but we were again reassured the order in full would be ready for a press conference to be screened on live tv .
negative	only days sbefore the press conference they started the kit but still assured us it would be ready , they told us to come at closing time on the friday to collect it .
negative	as it was toning we wrongly took their word that all kit was in boxes , it wasn_'_t , we were lied to as they knew there were still items incomplete but put that all items were in boxes anyway .
negative	when we discovered the following_morning that half the kit was missing an we rang them we were pretty_much just told that it wasn_'_t their problem and that we set unrealistic deadlines .
negative	they are now accusing me of lying and collecting all the kit as their receipt says so yet i have emails going beyond collection date and answer phone messages explaining the rest of the kit is ready 0 days after the deadline .
negative	i have decided to take this to bbc_watchdog now something i had no_intention of doing until i was accused of lying .
negative	i see that this is not a one off either .
negative	very very dissapointed
negative	they billed me over £ 0000 . 00 for data i didn_'_t use !.
negative	in my experience they couldn_'_t care less about their customers … they seem to be driven by greed .
negative	i wish they really did " record their calls " that way they couldn_'_t blatantly deny all responsibility for saying things they later deny .
negative	it '_s the orange customers who are the only real_asset and not the orange brand ironically run by " number crunchers " that have destroyed their own_brand by squeezing every drop of trust from its previously loyal_customers which is why ee can '_t wait to drop the name .
negative	i for one will be glad to see them finally run out of juice !
negative	i also hope that ee " everything everywhere " doesn_'_t apply to employing the bandits responsible for oranges demise .
negative	rotten to the core !
negative	it took 0_weeks of no action - no emails regarding progress and no reply to my inquiring email .
negative	i cancelled my order and bought elsewhere .
negative	i purchased a hay desk which arrived with no legs in the box .
negative	i have phone the helpline 0 times now , every time i am promised someone will call me back to arrange a replacement , so_far no one has .
negative	i am now left without anywhere to work and no one seems to care .
negative	after waiting 0 months for my £_000 cashback on sky i was told it was in the t &_c '_s that people in a block of flats is excluded from the offer ....... to which these terms and conditions are not clear in anyway on their site .
negative	shocking how a company can get away with this , when i could have got a slightly_smaller amount of cashback from a competitor and now i '_m left with nothing .
negative	do not use and use other cashback_sites to which i have not had problems before !
negative	i purchased a paid of goal keeper gloves .
negative	they were cheap and cheerful .
negative	i paid £ 0 but they were utter_rubbish .
negative	a waste of £ 0 .
negative	i wrote a constructive review of the products addidas f00 keeper gloves on there web_site and the sportsdirect . com moderator removed the review and said it wasn_'_t allowed .
negative	so sportsdirect . com will not let any bad_reviews of the products they sell onto there web_site !..
negative	trying to manipulate the reviews so all the products look good ..
negative	poor company ... poor standards !
negative	took_ages to get my items then i found some of my racks had parts of the shelf missing .
negative	i was told i would have the missing parts the next_day but they were sent by royal_mail standard delivery so again it took 0 - 0 days to get them , when they arrived they were the wrong_size and a different_colour .
negative	ended_up with a shelf on one of my racks with no sides as i couldn_'_t be_bothered to ask again for the missing parts even_though i had paid for them !
negative	!
negative	avoid this company !
negative	00 hour delivery arrives more 00 later .
negative	mix_up on address change so it took dpd 0 days to sort this out when a 00hour delivery was paid for .
negative	customer_services is a joke , told me to drive to oldbury ( 00 ) round_trip to collect the parcel instead of waiting .
negative	my company that sends out many parcels every week and has in the past used dpd will never again use this company .
negative	the reviews here do not reflect the company i and many others have been dealing_with .
negative	just read the forums on their own website to get a feel for just how bad this company is for paying out .
negative	never , i repeat , never buy through top cash_back if the cash_back is the reason .
negative	treat it as something you might get , not something that is guaranteed .
negative	you will have to work very hard to get the cashback .
negative	some stories on their own forum tell how people have waited 0 months , or even a year for cashback and are still fighting for it .
negative	you have been_warned !!
negative	!
negative	i ordered a summer bundle of pumps , shorts and 0 t shirts .
negative	they sent the wrong_colour and size of pumps .
negative	i contacted them ( not able to do this by phone ) through the site and returned the pumps for exchange .
negative	i had to chase them up after they had had them back for 0 days and was then told - out of stock and would get refund .
negative	now trying to get through to them that this was ordered as a bundle and i want to return the lot as it is not what i ordered at all , not just a refund for the part of the bundle .
negative	they do not answer what i sent them but what they think i should have asked .
negative	this has_been going on for 0_weeks .
negative	send a message and wait a day before any reply back .
negative	order number_00000000 .
negative	very good except for the long wait for a member of staff to arrive when picking_up the car .
negative	i was standing at the reception_desk with another couple for over half an_hour .
negative	there was no_indication as to where the member of staff was or how long he was going to be on the desk .
negative	my 0 colleagues who were with another hire company were served and ready to go almost_immediately after landing .
negative	the firm i hired from was advantage .
negative	i will not be using them again and i will ensure that i make other people aware that customer service was very poor .
negative	placed order with them , only because where lured with their next_day delivery promise .
negative	nothing arrived .
negative	0 days_later , received phone_call from dibranto .
negative	they where saying that they unable to proceed , as they don_'_t have item in stock .
negative	when i '_ve asked how long it will take them to get this item in , where told that they are not going to order this in .
negative	had to cancel my order .
negative	booked specific tyres (£_000 worth ) via the website on saturday , for fitting the following saturday .
negative	on friday i received a letter saying they had tried and failed to contact me by phone and email ( yet i had had no emails from them , no missed calls ...) and that there was a problem and could i call them .
negative	on calling , was told that the tyres were unavailable and they were substituting an_alternative ( which i had never_heard of ).
negative	i refused and said i was prepared to wait as i was in no rush - only to be told the manufacturers could not produce them for at_least 0_weeks , so national could not say how long the wait would be .
negative	i suggested they remove the tyres from their website as they clearly were advertising something they could not supply .
negative	i asked to cancel the order , and was told a refund would take 0 to 0 working_days ( which itself is odd , as the debit happens immediately .
negative	i will be taking my custom elsewhere .
negative	bison removals turned_up an_hour and a half late , with a van saying hunters on it , and which was too small to fit our two bed house .
negative	another van was called , a transit .
negative	nothing was said at this stage about additional_costs .
negative	one item got damaged in transit .
negative	half way through unloading , adam biddle from bison called me and demanded extra money .
negative	i soon offered to meet him half way but he wasn_'_t happy with anything less_than he asked .
negative	over an_hour of calls , arguing , personal abuse from adam , threats , lies etc , during which he had ordered his men to lock my remaining possessions in the van , i eventually agreed to paying most of it and got my stuff unloaded .
negative	it was night time by then .
negative	i felt blackmailed and would never use them again .
negative	it '_s true that their terms and conditions say they can keep your things until you paid , but that doesn_'_t mean you have to pay any amount they ask for in addition to what was quoted .
negative	adam had a very one - sided idea of what is lawful but seemed to fancy himself an expert , as he never stopped lecturing me about it , even after he knew that i had a good knowledge of the law .
negative	at various_stages he tried to use my family to make me give in .
negative	he also told me at various_stages that their office credit_card machine was working or not working , depending on what suited him , or that he had to talk to a supervisor , who shortly later didn_'_t seem to exist_anymore .
negative	company offers to forward business mail from a london address .
negative	i didn_'_t have much mail in the course of being a customer but when i did , customer '_s cheques didn_'_t arrive and had to be cancelled and other mail also never made it .
negative	i once sent a test letter to myself through their forwarding system and complaint when it never arrived .
negative	they did respond to my complaints but only after i sent a registered letter and never accepted any responsibility or agreed to a refund .
negative	i actually recorded a short video of myself posting that test letter as evidence .
negative	this week it arrived - 0 months late .
negative	prime secretarial claim it '_s a problem with the royal_mail but then why would things get lost only when people post something to them ?
negative	they clearly have a problem and a mail forwarding service which is that unreliable is simply a service not being delivered .
negative	i came to halfords_autocentre for a free brake and engine checks and got my vehicle back in messy condition : some of wheel_bolts wasn_'_t tight enough , engine cables were loose and not on the right place , an engine and around it was dirty .
negative	front right wheel made a noise after free check , mechanic used my tools and left them dirty plus a cover on my tool box was damaged also someone was checking what stuff i have in the car boot and the first shock was that i found my car unlocked on car_park !!!
negative	i wanted to complain and take a legal_action but next_day had to go on a long holiday ...
negative	i don_'_t recommend halfords_autocentre at all !!
negative	!
negative	i did an mot in chichester garage last_year .
negative	mechanic found burned number_plate bulbs and too loose handbrake .
negative	i '_m_sure the lights worked properly before i entered the garage , and i had to adjust the handbrake when i came back home because it was very tight ( this year didn_’_t have any problem with it ).
negative	another issue : the website says :
negative	" by arranging and paying for an mot online , you will pay only £_00 . 00 – a saving of over 00_% on the statutory mot_test fee ."
negative	it logically means that the mot normally costs £_00 so why the mechanic took off only £_00 of the total price of £_000 ?
negative	logically he supposed to take off the full price of mot to have a discount when i booked it online !
negative	my colleagues and friend have the same experiences : kwik_fit in chichester always “ finds ” something to repair or change to get some extra cash ...
negative	you could not fulfill my order
negative	after 0_weeks , we are still_waiting for one part of bed to arrive ( unusable without it ).
negative	this part was initially lost by the mattressman courier and then delivered one week_later ( earliest they could offer ) and was smashed to bits with footprints all over the outer_box .
negative	now awaiting delivery in yet anothert week of new replacement part to be able to build the bed .
negative	also found that in trying to sort_out the problem , mattressman customer service is always busy and all calls are diverted to a third_party call_centre to take a message and then it takes several hours to receive a return phone_call from cs .
negative	happily used mattressman many_times before but sadly never again
negative	i ordered a bouquet from iflorist on thursday 00th_september_0000 for delivery next_day ( and paid for this ) the next_day no delivery turned_up despite taking my money .
negative	i have tried to make contact on several_occasions as they have no phone contact i tried via_email and fax to no_avail .
negative	i have also sent my details with order reference to the address supplied on the web_site to see if i can make any contact .
negative	and am waiting to hear from them .
negative	i sent today registered_post a letter to ask that they make contact with me to resolve the situation and will wait to see if i have any reply .
negative	after 00years with vodafone i will be leaving them asap .
negative	i have had issues with data reporting .
negative	i have 0 x vodafone apps , 0 x iphone 0 data counter on my phone & when cmpared to vodafone internal data system all show different amounts , 0 . 0gb to 0 . 0gb .
negative	obviously this is a customer fault & vodafone can do absolutely nothing to assist .
negative	i have a data hungry phone & that is the end of the story as far as they are concerned .
negative	heres my synopsis to date :
negative	i added 0gb to my standard 0gb account for august & on the day it expired i was told that i had already been charged an additional £ 0 for exceeding my limit even_though further conversations with vodafone showed this to be incorrect they decided as a show of ' goodwill ' they credited my account .
negative	note : they didnt say it was a mistake , they paid goodwill - stretching the kpis for ofcom a little there .
negative	to ensure this was not my phone , i visited a genius ( from apple ) who checked everything on my phone & concluded that there is nothing running , let_alone installed , that would be causing that amount of data_usage in one month .
negative	0_weeks_later and my current data has_gone out of control .
negative	several unhelpful phone_calls later , visits to shops & live_chats has resulted_in me finding out that vodafone take 00_hours to update your data , no two service representatives give you the same answer , 00 hour call back on escalations means 0 working_days & not 0 days like you would expect , 0 attempts to call back does not exist , two of my escalations have resulted_in callbacks of 0 attempts in about 0 min & 0 attempt which the network dropped me !!!
negative	you then get a message_saying thanks for contacting vodafone & everything is now sorted .
negative	here is the beauty though , after informing_me of this next point they are now backtracking & denying it .
negative	any data used on an unbilled period is carried over to the next period even_though your contract is for a set period - in essence they ' double charge ' you this data & usage .
negative	one last point , i am in london where you would expect good coverage , however at any grouping of people ( train_station , stadium , airport ) the phone will tell you it is receiving 0g but it will not work , the little icon just keeps spinning .
negative	sound like a company you want to waste money on ?
negative	go somewhere_else , you only have yourself to blame if you choose vodafone .
negative	i have requested my file so that i can lodge it with ofcom .
negative	i had to waiting almost ten day for something the web_site said would be sent out the next_day
negative	i have purchased from here before normally o . k , but the last pair were so shoddy it was like they were made by a child in primary_school , they did not fit as the arms were at different_angles and the actual frame work around the lens was twisted .
negative	well i suppose it '_s workmanship for the money .
negative	there is no ability to talk with customer service over the phone so i will take my loss and go somewhere_else , 0 positive is that it was delivered quickly .
negative	i '_ve had nothing but trouble and broken_promises ( and items ) with citylink .
negative	i ordered a christmas_present from amazon for delivery on christmas_eve .
negative	i was then called into work at short_notice , so left a note for couriers on the door .
negative	two other couriers ( dpd and yodel ) asked my neighbour to take packages in .
negative	citylink didn_'_t even bother , nor did they put a card through the door to tell me they tried delivering it .
negative	i got the tracking ref from amazon and headed to the citylink website requesting i collect the parcel from the depot on the 00th ( the earliest they were open ).
negative	i went to the depot at 0am that morning after finishing work to be told they got my request but the driver had loaded the item onto the van and there was nothing they could do .
negative	eventually the depot manager rung the driver twice and told_him to divert and deliver it to me as he was only in the next village .
negative	i was told to go home and he would be there by 0am .
negative	0am came and went , same for 00am .
negative	couldn_'_t get hold of the depot directly but went through to customer_services , they couldn_'_t get in touch with them neither .
negative	about 00 . 00am i went to bed , i woke around 0pm to find no parcel or attempted delivery card .
negative	checking the tracking status it showed the item may have been damaged in transit and to contact citylink .
negative	so i did , they couldn_'_t tell me anymore than i could see on the website so i was told yet again i ' d need to go to the depot .
negative	i did and the parcel had been smashed to pieces .
negative	i was told by staff they didn_'_t bother to attempt the delivery as often people are very angry at the doorstep and have a go at the drivers .
negative	the fact i was told to go home and the driver would deliver my parcel within an_hour fell on deaf_ears .
negative	i was simply told they would return it to amazon and i ' d need to contact them to arrange a new one or a refund .
negative	i did this and amazon were very good , arranging to send out a new one but this would take a few more days ( christmas had been and long gone by now !)
negative	i also ring citylink to complain as directed to by the depot manager .
negative	on the phone i was told by a rude lady that i couldn_'_t do this and would have to fill in a form online .
negative	i pointed_out their own website says you can call , write or email your complaint or compliment .
negative	when i told her to check this out and listen to what i was trying to explain she huffed and hung_up the call .
negative	i do hope this call is recorded and listened back to .
negative	i then rung back again and spoke to a lady_who was the total_opposite of the last operator .
negative	she said she could take details of the complaint and a manager would ring me back within 00_hours .
negative	( they haven_'_t by the way ... another broken promise !)
negative	in the meantime .
negative	when the replacement was sent out by amazon it was sent by citylink again .
negative	it showed for delivery by 00 . 00am as amazon had paid for a priority delivery as a goodwill_gesture .
negative	00 . 00am came , no delivery , citylink saying they rang the depot and it was definitely out on the van and the driver was nearby .
negative	it got to 00 . 00 , no delivery and i was very sure the item wasn_'_t on the van and headed again to the depot .
negative	the guy on the enquiries counter found the item in the warehouse and yet again it had been smashed beyond use .
negative	he confirmed it was never scanned and loaded_onto the van for delivery that morning .
negative	all in all , from these experiences they are an awful company .
negative	can '_t wait for this manager to call me back to try and explain_why i have been lied to , had broken_promises ( and items ) and been disrespected .
negative	i won_'_t hold my breath on receving their call !
negative	i had the misfortune of dealing_with this company after buying a groupon_voucher for some banksy prints back in march .
negative	the company were quick to acknowledge the order but very slow and evasive responding to questions about delivery .
negative	there was a very long time_scale but i was happy to wait .
negative	when they eventually arrived ( past the allotted dates given ) i opened up the package to find two of the four prints were both bent and ripped .
negative	within 00_minutes of signing for the package i ' d photographed the contents and emailed artstate ( that was almost a month_ago !)
negative	stating i was unhappy and what did they plan to do about it ?
negative	well that '_s where the communication stopped .
negative	no responses to the emails ( responding to the previous emails they sent me )
negative	phone_calls went_unanswered , was told not to leave a message but email and they would respond within 00_hours .
negative	nothing !
negative	i eventually raised a support_ticket and complaint with groupon .
negative	a further 00 working_days passed and artstate didn_'_t even respond to me or groupon in that time frame so groupon are now putting the money back on my card , have cancelled the voucher and logged this complaint against them .
negative	totally rubbish and unacceptable customer service .
negative	i also plan to chase paypal to recover the postage fees paid as they can get these back from the carrier , but to be frank , it '_s their problem not mine .
negative	if i could give them zero_stars i would .
negative	0_star is being generous .
negative	avoid at all costs .
negative	i ordered a flower with a birthday_cake from iflorist . co . uk on 0th_jan_0000 and the website told me that they will deliver it on 0th as i required .
negative	i was waiting the whole day to hear any news from my friend but suddenly received an email which said :
negative	" good news !
negative	we can confirm that your recent order has_been successfully delivered as requested ."
negative	so i called her but she had no idea what i was talking_about and she went and checked her mail box but was nothing there .
negative	i tracked my order by yodel website and noticed that the parcel been delivered so i started live_chat on yodel website .
negative	after chatting with a guy called kapur he closed the chat instead of replying me so i started the chat again and a guy called lee got my number to call me .
negative	after 00mins talking on phone they told me a guy called " akman " signed and received my parcel and they told me i have to wait up to 0 days for asking the driver and these stuffs .
negative	i tried to contact to iflorist website but there is no phone number or direct mail on their website and they advised me to register to their forum .
negative	totally i have never seen these such a trouble before and it ruined all my plans and i still have no idea about what will happen next .
negative	i hope some one at_least read at respond to me for the first time !
negative	!
negative	i ordered a week_ago and am still_waiting for it to arrive .
negative	i can '_t review what i don_'_t have .
negative	orderd microsoft_points last night thinking i would be sent an email containing the point '_s but nothing .
negative	have tried every manner of communication to get in touch with staff but all calls are automated and after have spent a full day waiting for web help to just be told every twenty_minutes that my session had ended as all advisors were busy !!!!
negative	...
negative	i gave up and went to the belle vale store in netherly liverpool . after being refused physical points and showing them all correspondence of proof of purchase they managed to get hold of head_office who said they would resend the code with no offer of any apology for my wasted day or compensation .
negative	and guess_what i still have no code and no way of getting hold of anybody .
negative	why does it say that if we have a problem we can go to a store when they have no power to do anything ???
negative	very very annoyed and disapointed .
negative	i returned my good '_s via_royal_mail special delivery at my own cost & am still_awaiting a refund after they have had the item a full two_weeks .
negative	i can be sure of this as the tracking_number tell '_s me they have the item .
negative	when i speak to them on the phone i am told the refund is being_processed ...
negative	they have been processing it for two week '_s ....
negative	terrible experience and i would not recommend at all .
negative	they have a facebook_page that they are updating all the time yet they are too_busy to issue refund '_s ...
negative	they are even taking pictures of the snow !!!
negative	what great fun for them .
negative	very profesional !!!
negative	!
negative	eventually got my refund after many phone_calls .
negative	my advice pay a little more and shop else where .
negative	ordered items on the 00th_august_0000 .
negative	.
negative	i have emailed the company i have telephoned them five times i was promised the items would be delivered today ... friday the 00th " nothing ".
negative	everytime you speak to someone on the phone they say i '_ll phone you back ... you never hear from them again .
negative	total usless service , definatelly the worst service from any company i have dealt_with yet ... steer_well clear of them .
negative	i don_'_t review lightly and only for very good or very bad_experience , this was the latter .
negative	i was looking for a luna narrow 0 drawer gloss set in white and 0 small bedside units .
negative	having tried a couple of other placed to be told the 0 drawer set was out of stock i tried this company .
negative	i was told the 0 drawer set was in stock and although their website said they would " price match ", the small units were £_00 each cheaper_elsewhere but they wouldn_'_t " price match ".
negative	so i ordered the 0 drawer unit from them on 00th_april_0000 .
negative	the next thing was their tracking site said they were on order !
negative	two_weeks_later i asked what was happening and was told it would be in on friday 0th_may .
negative	the following_tuesday 0th_may i phoned to be told the supplier had to send them back to the manufacturer because the drawers were glossed but the case wasn_'_t .
negative	i was offered to wait_until june ( although others had told me they would not be available until july ) or have a refund , i chose the refund .
negative	the following friday 00th_may i phoned to say the refund had not arrived and was told it was on " oversight " in the accounts_department but would be done that day .
negative	i phoned the following_tuesday 00th_may to be told the refund was done on thursday 00th_may and would be in my account soon .
negative	i phoned the next_day wednesday 00th_may to be told the same story , done on thursday 00th_may .
negative	my wife phoned on thursday 00th_may to be told it was an_oversight in the accounts_department but would be done that day .
negative	the refund was finally given on friday 00th_may .
negative	judge for yourself if you think my one star is appropriate .
negative	would never use again and would not reccomend .
negative	the order has not been delivered nor have i been advised of when the order is likely to arrive .
negative	thought i would try the dog '_s doodahs , so i personalised a card , ordered it on the monday , first_class post and needed it for the friday and did not receive it .
negative	so i had to go and buy another card .
negative	i am very disappointed and don_'_t think i will be using you again .
negative	i placed an order around 0pm on saturday and emailed both stores at 0pm to explain i bought the wrong product and would like to cancel the order .
negative	i heard_nothing and 0 days_later i received the order .
negative	in those 0 days i twice emailed asking for an update and for the courier details so i could speak to the courier and tell them to cancel the delivery .
negative	again - i hear nothing back .
negative	on day 0 i emailed customer_services explaining the problem - and heard_nothing back .
negative	0 days_later i emailed again saying this time i am going to have the bank_transfers reversed which would be a lot of work for their legal team .
negative	i got an email_saying they had received none of my emails - despite my previous email being copied at the bottom of the one they were replying too ( ahem bulls_** t ).
negative	this time they promised to resolve the issue but 0 days_later i am once again in the state of not knowing anything - there is absolutely no communication happening at all .
negative	i will never , ever , ever use cash_generator in my life again and would recommend against using their online services .
negative	complete dog sh_* t with lots of unnecessary_stress .
negative	if you ' re competing in the same online space as amazon and ebay , you won_'_t last long treating your customers like this .
negative	any business needs a robust structure to ultimately deliver an exceptional customer experience .
negative	many business talk about putting the consumer at the heart of their thinking including sky .
negative	but they don_'_t .
negative	i concede that they have a good product but that '_s where it ends .
negative	without paying a high price to call sky , which many people are unprepared to do , it is very hard to get in touch with sky unless you ' re happy to deal with a non uk_based centre ( which i '_m not ).
negative	so i write to sky on three_separate_occasions explaining this and receive one unsatisfactory call in response , therefore ignoring two other letters asking for information .
negative	as i '_m moving home ( and out of contract ) and was paying a considerable_amount per_month to sky you might have thought that for the cost of a telephone_call for my continued patronage might be worth it .
negative	think again .
negative	the way sky is managed is a complete disconnect with no - one allowed to either take_ownership of a problem nor use their initiative .
negative	therefore i '_ve canceled my subscription .
negative	ultimately over a period of 0 months ( yes 0 months ) sky have not found a way of allowing me to call them without paying for the cost of the call .
negative	i have had a trail of emails with some robotic centre based i know not where you use cut and paste techniques to never fulfil my needs .
negative	it really beggars_belief how inept and short - sighted sky have been in this process .
negative	apart_from losing my custom there is the impact of word of mouth as if anyone asks my views apropos sky they are not tinged with any real positive glow .
negative	they really have lost complete touch with the customer experience .
negative	it also makes me laugh out loud every time i hear their tag line " believe in better ".
negative	their kidding us , right ?
negative	newsflash : do believe all you see and read about bt .
negative	bt are one those organisations that manage to shoot themselves in both feet .
negative	the way that they are organised is counter - intuitive to delivering a customer_focused business which is what they claim they want to achieve .
negative	they are riddled with bureaucracy , take little or no ownership of customer '_s problems and toothless at resolving the most basic issues .
negative	we moved home and gave bt 0_weeks to deliver on a specified day , which at no time did they challenge or suggest would pose any_issues .
negative	we wanted a phone line , although as we use mobiles mainly so this was not as important as broadband .
negative	we also wanted broadband which , for the many , is indispensable .
negative	you must have read the script because the phone line was not a problem ( although a story to tell at another time ) but they could not provide us with broadband .
negative	actually the guys said it was an easy fix but it required the two bt companies supplying us talking to each other .
negative	fast forward to innumerable and unsatisfactory calls including me taking time off and waiting in all afternoon for an a no - show engineer ( he went to the cab and it was too hard from him , so i subsequently discovered ).
negative	we then get the indianian call_centre horror show which is too distressing to recount .
negative	after another round of hugely emotional calls we eventually get an engineer over , who has_been sub - contracted , and spends two hours achieving nothing and totally contradicts everything we '_ve been told before leaving us stranded .
negative	we still don_'_t have broadband and are waiting to hear how we will be compensated .
negative	the customer service experience was the double shotgun to both feet again .
negative	it '_s so appalling it '_s a complete embarrassment .
negative	bt are pitifully unempathetic and lacking in any desire to out the customer first .
negative	they really don_'_t care and the people you speak are robots who have zero ability to get things done .
negative	it '_s a complete and utter_shambles .
negative	to cap it all we had been double charged for something else and noticed that we couldn_'_t see where the credit was .
negative	good old bt hadn_'_t effected the credit .
negative	when asked why , there was no satisfactory_explanation .
negative	you might think ryan_air , virgin and sky are bad but bt make them look like the sisters theresa .
negative	gumtree needs to more accountable to sellers .
negative	it '_s owned by e_- bay who do offer some protection to sellers .
negative	on gumtree it '_s a free for all where there are no rules and potential_buyers have a free reign .
negative	the number of times i '_ve no shows from potential sellers who expressed a burning desire to want what was for sale is legion .
negative	it completely wastes your time by which time you '_ve turned away some genuine buyers .
negative	it doesn_'_t stop there as there seems to be an unwritten belief that no matter_how fairly you price goods the buyer thinks you should knock - off a random figure .
negative	as a seller you have little , if any , recourse to complain unlike with e_- bay '_s feedback system .
negative	the experience is absolutely shiv kin and makes e_- bay look like harrods by comparison .
negative	i decided to try gumtree as the costs ( as a seller ) for using e_- bay have escalated to a very high_level .
negative	even applying fees on postage which is absurd .
negative	please_bear in mind that gumtree is owned by - you can guess - e_- bay .
negative	i went into using gumtree as a seller with my eyes_open as i had heard some pretty awful stories .
negative	i guess with e_- bay you get a sense that there is some semblance of the buyer and seller protection .
negative	gumtree is a jungle which is not helped by their own systems which are inadequate .
negative	before trying to sell something on gumtree i wanted to get a used iphone .
negative	whilst there are genuine sellers i saw one locally which looked to be good to be true .
negative	in an effort to smoke this guy out i asked a number of questions which a genuine seller would be prepared to answer .
negative	shortly_after this i received an e_- mail from gumtree saying this guy was a suspected fraudster so don_'_t take this further .
negative	they also rightly deleted the ad .
negative	i was reassured by this is i thought i ' d try an sell something .
negative	i know what i '_m doing but the ad didn_'_t post .
negative	i ask why and am told that i had violated gumtree rules and i was barred from using gumtree and they wouldn_'_t discuss the matter .
negative	end of .
negative	phoning them costs an arm and a leg and they wouldn_'_t respond to e_- mails .
negative	therefore i wrote to them demanding , under the rules pertaining to the data_protection act , what information they had on file as is my right .
negative	after a while i get an e_- mail from gumtree admitting a mistake with a reluctant apology .
negative	i have tried to sell a few things on gumtree and the experience is painful despite_being quite brutal in my listings about things .
negative	the items i sell are priced to sell so i am no interested in offers .
negative	i don_'_t deliver , which i put in block capitals .
negative	even so i had one person ask if i '_ll make a 00 mile_round_trip for an item which cost £_00 .
negative	it seems to me that the accepted rules of the gumtree jungle if you ' re a buyer is that you ignore what people put down in terms of price and frankly people don_'_t read what you write .
negative	the most frustrating aspect is the number if complete time_wasters you get which is demoralising , time_consuming and massively frustrating .
negative	for example .
negative	" this is exactly_what i want can i pick it up tomorrow "
negative	i reply yes , supply my address and we agree a time .
negative	then no one shows up .
negative	i e_- mail and ask if there was a problem and the answer is " yeah i changed my mind ".
negative	this has happened on a few occasions and unlike e_- bay you can '_t leave_feedback .
negative	even_though they are part of the same organisation i have reluctantly reverted_back to e_- bay .
negative	i also discovered preloved . com who , although doesn_'_t have the audience reach of gumtree / e_- bay i have sold product through successfully without the awful gumtree experience .
negative	without_prejudice
negative	the boom in cycling i guess keeps them afloat but the customer experience is beyond_belief .
negative	there '_s no point in complaining as the compaints team don_'_t bother to ask your opinion and are toothless .
negative	they give a sanitised ' corporate " response which is based on the customer is always wrong .
negative	took my car for a new radio for my wife .
negative	no expertise on site but happy to take your money .
negative	went back and left with a bigger problem than when i started .
negative	a big hole where a once working radio was with the bracket bent beyond_repair ( i was told that removal of bracket would take two minutes not an_hour ).
negative	no - one on site to help .
negative	manager as useful as a chocolate_teapot .
negative	complained and told my problem not theirs but gave refund .
negative	the customer experience is everything and as businesses like comet and countless others discovered deliver this or go out of business .
negative	really shoddy and unprofessional experience , never again .
negative	on placing an order i realised the offer hadn_'_t come on at the end of the invoice i therefore phoned the customer service team who were extremely rude & unhelpful , as i ' d only used them once before & also experienced some problems , products missing from my parcel & when phoning also that the staff were rude .
negative	the products they sell are so reasonable but the staff need some customer service training
negative	really frustrated with the service - bad delivery - ordered and paid extra £ 0 for next_day delivery ( and before the cut - off time ), next_day delivery was confirmed , they charged me £ 0 .
negative	never delivered that day .
negative	never called or sent an email that delivery is postponed .
negative	just delivered next_day - arrived only next_day - who needs flowers if they do not arrive on time - people could have been out of the country next_day .
negative	and again never apologised or even called / emailed
negative	amazed at how small and mean these looked .
negative	very misled by the picture that showed them to be far more than they were .
negative	so embarrassed about them .
negative	will never buy again from these rip_off_merchants .
negative	despite the address being correct and cross_referenced with googe and 000 . com , there driver could not deliver would not recommend high disappointed ...
negative	please offer a refund for late delivery .
negative	additionally the flowers were not open or well timed with the other flowers .
negative	very disappointed .
negative	horrible experience .
negative	avoid and buy new - lap tops are getting cheaper and cheaper .
negative	real_pain in the ass
negative	unfortunately for some reason that escapes me , i did not as usual look for reviews on wae_+ otherwise i would not be writing this .
negative	i too like so many others have placed an order ( for a tv ) that was and still is shown as ' 0 in stock '.
negative	once i saw the reviews i thought it a good idea to contact by email to see when my order was to be fulfilled as it had been 0 days and no communication .
negative	well what a surprise , the next_day i received a reply , but it '_s not good news .
negative	it seems the manufactures don_'_t make the model any more , so why is it still listed as being ' in stock '.
negative	have asked for a full_refund but don_'_t expect i '_ll get that in the next 0 days .
negative	had problems with orders missing items , had extremely rude and abusive emails ( just because i asked for orders to be changed and i returned one item ), poor packing that leads to damaged items .
negative	given them enough chances to make_amends and they have proven that they are not a reliable or professional business .
negative	buy your cards from [_external_reference_], they have a fantastic customer service , and deal with questions etc , in a friendly_manner and they send items out in boxes with fantastic packing .
negative	if you have any sense at all , avoid chaos_cards .
negative	in response to the reply_below :
negative	only wanted to remove a couple items from my last order , not your exaggeration of every order .
negative	apparently , according to the owner , it takes too much time and money to change an order , so it was either keep it or get banned again .
negative	i refused the delivery of only one order ( an innistrad booster box , which i now regret ) and you took the postage_costs from my refund , so you didn_'_t pay royal_mail .
negative	one order was lost in the post ( i never received it ) i told chaos_cards and under their idiotic rules i was banned .
negative	why should i be banned for something out of my control ?!
negative	( rhetorical question ).
negative	you have proved yourself a liar and a complete fool .
negative	i have not lied once and have facts and proof to back up what i say .
negative	i must have spent over £ 0000 on your website and i '_m treated in a disgraceful manner .
negative	you should be_ashamed .
negative	also what you said to the other person_who gave you 0_star " we are in the enviable position of not having to chose to deal with every customer who comes to our site ."
negative	that just shows that you ' re arrogant and self righteous .
negative	however , i forgive you and will not be replying to anything_else you say as i do not wish to lower myself to your standards .
negative	i hope people can see you for who you really are , but i hope more so that you see the error of your ways and change and have a good life .
negative	i also apologise for some of the things i said in the email , i was angered by the unfriendly and condescending email you sent me ( with the same tone as others you have sent before ) and i felt it was the last_straw .
negative	enough said , i wish you well and kind_regards .
negative	i booked the flight ticket through opodo and the flight company charged me already , however opodo charged me 00 pounds in the next_day with any explanation .
negative	it seems like a service charge for booking the ticket !!!
negative	00 pounds service fee ???
negative	just for booking ticket online ?
negative	isn_'_t it ridiculous ???!!!
negative	moreover , they did not noticed me about the service charge when i was about to checkout for the ticket on their website !!!!!!!
negative	!
negative	been waiting now for weeks to unlock my iphone , tried_contacting the company because one day the website says im waiting to be unlocked and then the next_day it says that there is no record of my order , not only that the company has charged me twice and will not contact me to tell me if this issue has_been resolved , all im asking for is someone to tell me whats_going on is that to much to ask ?
negative	so anyway conclusion is that i have been charged_twice for no service what so ever and on top of that no one will talk to me , i would not recommend this service to anyone , if possible use another company , maybe one with a bit more people skills
negative	having had excellent experience in the past i persuaded my wife to let_me send some small xmas_presents , decorations , lights etc to our children in johannesburg
negative	all went well and the parcel was picked_up in the uk on the 0th_december .
negative	my daughter was contacted by ups to pay duty which she did on 00th_dec
negative	it is now 00th_dec and we find out the parcel is lost in germany
negative	it has_been up to us to get the ups tracking_number .
negative	transglobal are not able to give it to us ??
negative	the attitude of transglobal staff is unacceptable and i was given the standard procedure about 0 times !
negative	we are now in natal so unlikely to get it before_xmas .
negative	great stuff transglobal !
negative	i will not be using you again .
negative	a company that will rip you off .
negative	none of the staff know what they are talking_about .
negative	avoid if possible .
negative	the most expensive company for tv and broadband and phone .
negative	terrible customer service .
negative	and installation a disaster .
negative	ordered something over a week_ago .
negative	not had anything in the post yet .
negative	will wait a few more days before contacting paypal for a refund .
negative	will not use cash_generator again .
negative	ordered pair of bib_shorts - excellant turnaround but wrong_colour !
negative	returned shorts at my expense and had to wait another week before my order was finally completed .
negative	no comunication at all from firm .
negative	no recompense for insured / recorded return delivery even_though this had been promised !
negative	had problems acctvating card , spoke to customer service , said the card would be accivated within the next 00_hours , went to use the card more than 00_hours after the call , no money on the card & had to cancel purchase , this was very emarissing as it was for my wife '_s birhday , sent an email reply to mazuma but not had any reply , not tried the card since , feel this has_been a very bad experince
negative	further to my previous review and where the delivery of my sons pool_table proved to be a disgrace even after the promise of set time delivery failed abysmally it eventually arrived on the 0th arranged attempt by agency driver .
negative	the box was damaged and looked as though it had gone_through a rough time .
negative	we signed for the box as damaged the driver also suggested this .
negative	i stored the box in the garage as i wanted to hide this present from my son until xmas day , he uses the garage too so i didn_'_t want to open it for him to discover it .
negative	built it up on xmas day and found 0 different aspects of damage .
negative	on contact with this company initially by phone to a lady we were asked to send photos , so we did .
negative	they then came back and said as this wasn_'_t a manufacturing_fault and wasn_'_t reported within 00_hours so there is nothing they can do about it .
negative	as you can_imagine i am not a happy man , i have bought hundreds of items online and never_experienced anything like this before .
negative	i will pursue this further with trading_standards we just want what we paid for or some other solution ... be very careful if you are considering purchases from this site , they need to change their claimed 0 reasons to buy to 0 and add customer service .
negative	i can '_t even begin to describe the experience of these utter idiots .
negative	in simple terms i ordered a double_bed almost three_months_ago and they damaged it .
negative	had to have another ordered which was delayed and i '_ve been trying to get the faulty item returned five times now .
negative	i '_ve wasted hours of my time waiting in and calling them on their so called helpline that takes an average of forty_minutes to answer .
negative	all to no_avail .
negative	they even lied and said they ' d been to the address and that the item had been collected !!!
negative	the mail order sender is of no help either .
negative	the problem is they have a captive public who can '_t choose any alternative so you ' re at their mercy .
negative	the next pick_up us arranged for next saturday .
negative	i was extremely disappointed that my order for my mums_00th never arrived .
negative	she only turns 00 once and i ordered a lively bunch of flowers never to arrive .
negative	i '_m actually really annoyed and don_'_t tend to use the service again .
negative	paypal is a gateway to fraud !
negative	if you are a seller stay_away from paypal cos you will pay pall !
negative	paypal is a gateway to fraud .
negative	stay_away from them if you are a seller cos you will pay pall !
negative	they turn a blind eye to fraud and only care about the fees they get .
negative	i ordered from our local takeaway as we had done for just under a year .
negative	on this occasion we asked for a few adjustments to our pizza .
negative	the delivery arrived after an_hour and a half , cold and without the adjustment we had requested .
negative	the delivery arrived after 00pm so there was no point in complaining .
negative	i got the standard feedback email from just eat which i responded explaining the takeaway was not its usual standard , i was amazed to receive an email from just eat a day later explaining the takeaway had " barred " me due to leaving the feedback !
negative	!
negative	i expressed my anger at just eat and it was ignored , it later transpires that the takeaway claim my comments were " not good english " and that just eat agreed with this !!
negative	as you will see from my comments my english is perfect and my comments around having cheese on a doner pizza were perfectly_acceptable .
negative	i am trying to delete my account with just eat and if the takeaway is correct then i would definitely not want to deal with a company that is racist
negative	i moved_into my new build property on the 00th_october_0000 .
negative	it is now the 00nd_march_0000 & first_utility have not yet been able to provide me with any bills for my gas & electric with the exception of an initial bill which was incorrect .
negative	i have rung them up & provided them with meter_readings on a reasonably regular_basis ( in_spite of having smart_meters ).
negative	in december_0000 they randomly extracted over £_000 from my account without_any notice or production of a bill .
negative	this was subsequently refunded to my account in january_0000 with no acknowledgement of the financial difficulties this had caused me .
negative	i have requested details of my tariff and have calculated what i believe i owe them so if i can do this then why cant they ??
negative	?
negative	it also seems impossible for them to acknowledge any written communication & the ' contact us ' on the web_site is very hit & miss , on one occassion it took over 0 months to even get an_automated acknowledgement .
negative	overall a very poor experience for a first time home owner & i definitely wouldnt recommend using first_utility .
negative	i am now looking at transferring my services elsewhere .
negative	we recently_moved_house and contacted orange in plenty of time to arrange to have our line connected and our number transferred . as requested the bt_engineer arrived the day before we moved in to connect up the phoneline and broadband service this was the 00 feb .
negative	we were told it would take a week to ten days for our line to " stabilize " and get up to speed . as i am typing this now on the 00 march i am awaiting a bt_engineer to call tomorrow to rectify the faulty line we have finally been told is the problem .
negative	to date i have lost_count of the time and effort that has_gone in to attempting to get orange that we dont need a new router ( sent but made no difference ) our line doesnt need " resetting " and allowing to settle for three_days . but surely the " best " one was ringing on thursday last_week to be told we were scheduled a call from the level0 team ( the " experts ") between_0am and 0pm i rang at 0pm and was not aware of this call being scheduled , anyway 0pm came and went and suprise no call , i phoned again and was told by an expert ( but not in customer relartions ) oh_yes i knew your router was delayed so i didn_'_t bother calling you !!!!!!!!!!!!!!
negative	however i was not ringing them for that reason so obviously telepathy is not a strong point at orange .
negative	it is my intention as soon as is humanly and contractually possible to leave both orange home and mobile , and i have been a customer for over 0 years as i feel totally let_down by this supposedly " blue_chip " company
negative	i would never use this company again .
negative	i got a £_00 bouquet for my wife for christmas , it looked nothing like the picture on the site .
negative	there were no roses in it like the website picture .
negative	tbh i could have bought better from morrisons for a tenner .
negative	i gave the flowers away and bought some more .
negative	i wrote to customer_services and heard_nothing back .
negative	i have learnt my lesson .
negative	i will use a local_florist and pay a bit more for something decent .
negative	you get what you pay for !!
negative	!
negative	they would not price match another company due to there next_day delivery but it took 0 days so in hindsight i should of ordered at the other company and saved money .
negative	also no replies from there customer emails .
negative	other then that ok
negative	the service i received was very good flowers where deliveried as expected and they looked lovely on day 0 by day 0 which was christmas day the roses had died even know we had put them in a clean vase the day before .
negative	by the next_day the lilly died as well so only had a nice bunch of flowers for the actual day of the delivery
negative	i booked a courier through shiply for a collection from spain to be done whilst i was there for a week .
negative	when the job is accepted you pay a 00_% deposit which it seems is for the courier .
negative	although it states there are no fees , it is in fact a booking_fee for shiply and the courier never sees it .
negative	you think that by paying a deposit there is more of a guarantee that the courier will show up and that if they don_'_t then you should be able to get your money back .
negative	shiply state they are acting as a middle_man and don_'_t give refunds of the booking_fee but you can have a credit to be used within 0 months .
negative	worse still , because its tucked_away in the terms & conditions the excuse is that they are only providing a service rather_than goods which means paypal won_'_t refund it either .
negative	i would advise anyone looking for transport services to think_twice before using this website and check the forums and chatrooms with regards to this subject .
negative	waste of time getting this company to pick you up .
negative	i waited nearly 0 hours to be picked_up spoilt my holiday
negative	items not recieved
negative	we ordered a vege pizza to be delivered only to discover it was covered in meat .
negative	we called to explain and an extremely rude member of staff called alisha told us we could ' have a free side next time '?!
negative	we said we would like them to actually deliver what we ordered and she very rudely_told us it would be with us in 00_minutes .
negative	after an_hour we called to say that nothing had arrived and we would now like our money back to which we were told ' that '_s fine feel free to come to the store to collect it .'
negative	how very helpful when delivery is more often than not used for ease and convenience i ' d have thought !
negative	after asking for the money to be brought back i was told ' we are too_busy '.
negative	so , i took the guys name and told_him that if the money was not back with us in 00_minutes i would call the police and have him personally arrested for theft ... funnily_enough they got the money back to me within 0 minutes at that point so it appears they weren_'_t too_busy after all .
negative	appalled_by such poor customer service , but , when you let young_children run your business this is inevitably what will happen .
negative	i '_ll be ordering elsewhere next time that '_s for sure .
negative	i ordered an item online under the premise that the item was available for next_day delivery ( because the website said it was ).
negative	so , the next_day i tracked my order to see that it had changed to ' item on back order ' - it wasn_'_t even in stock !!!
negative	0 days_later , it was still on back order , so i cancelled , got a refund and ordered the same item on amazon ... the jessops website is misleading and wasted my time .
negative	i won_'_t be bothering again .
negative	i booked my car in for a service at the crewe branch and there was a mix_up over pretty_much everything .
negative	work requested to be carried_out was not done and there was a query over the fee ( it was different from what i believed i was quoted ).
negative	it took over 0_weeks to get any kind of resolve on the situation as the service manager has no customer service skills whatsoever .
negative	all he kept saying when i pointed_out problems and issues was ' yeah , i '_ll take that on the chin '...!
negative	it didn_'_t really help me out though .
negative	i had to chase for responses , answers and appeared to be told anything to ' get_rid of me '.
negative	i had different_stories and basically felt i was lied to and treated appallingly as a paying customer .
negative	i '_ll be avoiding like the plague in future and believe that they are representing the ford name in a very poor manner .
negative	two bad_experiences , latest one , order was accepted on site , got a call 00mins later and was told that the order hadn_'_t got through and it was going to take 0 - 0 days to refund it .
negative	i won_'_t be using them again now .
negative	can '_t provide what you advertised
negative	initial switch went well problems started after 0 month review tried to increase dd by 00_% customer_services didnt want to know wouldnt return phone_calls , e_mails , i had to stop dd to make them contact me all staff agreed new dd stupid but unable to stop increase after stand off reverted to original monthly dd then they didnt take dd was threatened with baliffs ect ended uo in last_year paying 00 months dd plus final_bill of £_00 have now left never again you have been_warned !
negative	ordered from serenataflowers . com based_upon web_site reviews .
negative	got a text the day after the flowers were supposed to have been delivered " flowers have been left securely at the front of the property ".
negative	flowers never appeared .

negative	and seems that the flowers were left_outside in a public area .
negative	what a joke .
negative	i contacted customer_support 0 days ago .
negative	no answer .
negative	thye no_longer offer a telephone complaints line .
negative	no surprise .
negative	contacted them again today .
negative	don_'_t trust them .
negative	i am furious i want a refund i havent recieve my purchase .
negative	i intend to press charges
negative	ordered a wrist / thumb support paid extra to have next_day delivery before 0pm .
negative	delivery did not come until after 0pm by which time i had left for work .
negative	delivery company customer service is automated and you cant get saturday delivery or determine day or time of redelivery even_though you have paid for this .
negative	physioroom . com does not answer online questions or emails !
negative	order should have been delivered to me by 0pm tuesday 0rd sept , after dealing_with live_chat someone eventually phoned me with such an attitude that i cancelled my order and asked for a full_refund , which they agreed !
negative	00th_sept after many unanswered messages left on physioroom system i still have no refund nor any communication from physioroom .
negative	use this service at your own_risk ....... sounds ok but if anything_goes_wrong your stuffed !
negative	i recently_purchased an iphone off ebay and the seller chose to ship using collect_+.
negative	having received no update on tracking_information in over the stated 0 days i contacted customer_services .
negative	they were very helpful and said they would contact the chessington depot to locate the parcel .
negative	i have today been contacted by the seller to say that collect_+ have classified the package as " missing ".
negative	having read some reviews on here before it seems very convenient that parcels with electronic and expensive items seem to be the ones disappearing regularly and chessington has_been mentioned before ....
negative	the seller is currently following the compensation procedure but it seems he will be left out of pocket and i will never receive my parcel ....
negative	the flowers arrived in very nice packaging but unfortunaely they where in such poor condition that we had to throw some away the same day and two_days_later all apart_from the lillies died .
negative	it seems to me that less should be spent on the packaging and more on the quality of the flowers .
negative	i will not be using this service again .
negative	sneaky , awful customer service !
negative	i took out a one month_contract for mobile_broadband and made it clear that it was just a stop gap whilst waiting for sky to be installed - so definitely only wanted it for one month .
negative	at no time was it mentioned that it was a rolling_contract but have just found out that after using the service for the intended first month ( and not thereafter ), i have been charged for this every_month since for the last 00 months !!
negative	of course it will be buried in terms and conditions somewhere but surely that was a key enough fact to make me aware when purchasing ?
negative	especially after explaining why and how i was using the service .
negative	and nobody has time to spend their lives reading small_print , hence_why they have to be fair and reasonable , or the key points notified to customers .
negative	absolutely_disgraceful .
negative	having spent around £ 0000 in a 0 week period on 0 orders , so_far not one has_been delivered on time or without bits missing .
negative	when i got a call on last order saying it was now going to be a week_later i spoke with a manager at call_centre .
negative	he promised to call me back on the day the good were delivered ... guess_what not call .
negative	avoid homebase once they have your money they don_'_t care .
negative	i ordered £_000 of windows 0 software from them on 0th_september .
negative	it never arrived and so they said they re - sent it .
negative	each time they failed to provide a tracking_number andso i was unable to trace what happened to the parcel .
negative	when i contacted customer_services they were curt and unhelpful in their reponses and kept asking me to call them on a number that does not work outside of germany .
negative	they then closed my ticked .
negative	a terrible customer experience with awful customer service - avoid at all costs !
negative	i have spent_nearly_£ 0000 in recent months and have used bathstore in the past too .
negative	when my builder went to install one cloakroom sink we realised it would not work .
negative	i therefore enquired_about a refund .
negative	this was not possible and i could not even exchange it for something else because i was outside of your policy dates .
negative	the items are still packaged and could be resold easily .
negative	i would even have accepted a handling_fee .
negative	this kind of short_sighted customer service is crazy and does nothing to inspire me to recommend or use you again .
negative	what a shame .
negative	something that i think should be reconsidered to retain customer loyalty .
negative	was told my product would be with me by the 00th of december , that '_s why i ordered from juno .
negative	but still no delivery !!!
negative	not happy !
negative	0_star still_awaiting 0 item told out of stock on invoice heard_nothing since almost 00 days since order not very impressed
negative	ordered collection and delivery for several items .
negative	no courier turned_up .
negative	next_day contacted them and they have an autormated system that says sorry to hear that i will rebook it for you .
negative	gave them the benefit of the doubt .
negative	eventually courier turned_up 0 days_later .
negative	.
negative	0 days_later clients asking me where their goods are .
negative	checked tracking codes .... awaiting collection when in fact the items were on their vans .
negative	.
negative	arrived 0 days late .
negative	weeks passed and i was very busy so decided to give them another try as i had read good reviews ...
negative	wish i hadnt ... late pick_up again and lost 0 parcels and 0 sent to wrong_address '_s ... no way of contacting them ..
negative	my advice dont be silly ... save your money and look about , theres cheap couriers everywhere including ebay ..
negative	these_people will cause you stress and lose you customers .
negative	i placed two orders on the 00th of june with ccl .
negative	the first order contained a copy of microsoft windows 0 and a cooler_master hyper 000 evo cpu_cooler .
negative	the second order contained a corsair ax000 professional series gold 000 and another cooler_master hyper 000 evo cpu_cooler .
negative	when these items were ordered i was told there were plenty in stock , however once the order was placed 0 days_later i was informed that the cpu coolers were not in stock .
negative	so as i needed these parts in a timely_fashion i was forced to cancel the coolers as they would not send the rest of the order .
negative	to this effect i created two tickets each quoting the order numbers and requesting the aforementioned items be cancelled .
negative	the first cooler was cancelled quickly and the windows 0 copy dispatched for which i am pleased .
negative	however the second cooler was not cancelled and i received a rudely written reply to my ticket implying that i do not read my e_- mails .
negative	when i proved that i had asked for both to be cancelled i was just told the system had not updated which i found to be odd as i requested cancellation at the same time .
negative	i will be placing the second order with amazon and have no desire to use ccl again and will strongly_recommend against anyone i know using them .
negative	i am not happy at all with the un profressional way the flowers and choclates were delivered to the wrong_address and left out in the rain rendering the choclates inedible ,
negative	and the flowers ruined by wind and rain .
negative	not what you want on a six month anniversary and also valentines_day !
negative	!.
negative	i called aspect . co . uk to check and repair my boiler which the pressure kept falling .
negative	the engineer attended and visual checked the boiler for half an_hour .
negative	he left , then i received an email that i need to remove boxing to give access to vpr which seems faulty .
negative	next_day they charged my card for £_000 !
negative	it mentions £_00 for one hour plus £_00 for material plus_vat .
negative	i called the accounting department several_times to clarify why they charged me for material whilst the engineer just had a visual check and they promised to come_back to me which never happened .
negative	i still have the same problem with the boiler and lost £_000 just to receive an email that my boiler has a fault !
negative	it is just a ripp off .
negative	they get the details of your card at the first place and then charge you whatever they want !
negative	i placed an order on 0th_december for goods that were in stock and paid for delivery on monday0th .
negative	no tracking_information provided ... goods never arrived , spoke to their customer_services who were very unhelpful and difficult ..
negative	the goods were only dispatched on the monday ... told them that there would be no one available to receive the goods other than a fixed time_slot on wednesday ...
negative	guess_what no delivery in that time_slot ... drive couldn_'_t find the address ....
negative	customer_services ... useless their response we '_ll send it to a shop for you to collect .. told them that was unacceptable if i ' d had the time to go to a shop i ' d have gone to a shop ...
negative	now it '_s supposed to come friday ...
negative	i '_ll only be in for a time_slot and as the goods have to be signed for by me no one else can take receipt ... will it arrive in that time_slot i doubt it .
negative	i strongly_recommend you look else where i regret placing the order ....
negative	yep !
negative	they are almost_impossible to contact ( it took me many many hours ) and they have no idea where the goods they claim to have dispatched may be .
negative	i will be contacting master card for a refund .
negative	i had over 0000 official vintage cd singles and went to the trouble of typing every barcode in for ziffit - it took a day and a half .
negative	out of all 0000 , all were rejected except a mere 00 , for which they paid a lousy £_00 .
negative	too late i discover you expect flawless jewel cases with every one , brand_new pvc sleeves are not acceptable .
negative	i could not buy maxi single jewel cases for love or money in leicester , meaning i had to order them on e_- bay , costing a further £_00 .
negative	that is totally_unreasonable .
negative	go to any vip collectors record fair and you will find virtually all cd singles for sale in those same pvc sleeves : it is standard_practice .
negative	you guys need to move with the times or you will be left_behind .
negative	think also of the massive space - saving ( and cost - saving weight - wise ) exercise it would be for the couriers plus your own storage requirements .
negative	not just that , the barcode generated for collect_plus was rejected at the collection_point necessitating a trip home to sort_out the issue then a return to the shop .
negative	in short , a very stressful experience i will not be in a hurry to repeat .
negative	what '_s that statistic - one dissatisfied customer tells at_least 00 others ?
negative	net profit : £_00 - you ask too much and i doubt i shall be using your service again .
negative	i placed an order and specified a delivery address only for my order to be delivered to the billing_address which is hundreds of miles_away .
negative	a full week_later and i am still_waiting for my delivery .
negative	whilst items get dispatched quickly , the behaviour of customer_services on social_media borders on the offensive , and questioning this will quickly leave you blocked .
negative	i ' d have previously recommended them , but dealing_with cs , i simply can '_t any more - if a company can '_t deal with complaints reasonably , then they are best avoided .
negative	received a faulty product .
negative	no problem to return it , and to get a new product within a few_days , but 000golf refused to pay for my return shipment cost .
negative	something that they are obliged according to european consumer_protection laws to do .
negative	and though they promised to do so when i contacted them before the return .
negative	to bad , and i would recommend everybody to think_twice before buying from them , if you don_'_t want to take the risk for getting problems if there is something wrong with the order
negative	having sourced the perfect stool type chairs to go in my new kitchen , and to create a small breakfast_bar effect , and to complement a glass table i already had , i ordered 0 stool chairs , and paid for next_day delivery .
negative	unfortunately , only 0 arrived the next_day .
negative	when i called they said oh , the 0rd is still in warehouse .
negative	i therefore expected the 0rd chair to arrive the next_day ... it hasn_'_t .
negative	i have requested a refund on the next_day delivery fee , and am still_waiting on the 0rd chair / stool .
negative	product is good , and just what i was after .
negative	it '_s a shame i don_'_t have all of them still .
negative	i have ordered many things from zavvi , and mostly everything has_gone_smoothly .
negative	i ordered 0 items at the same time , 0 of these items i waited weeks for to be despatched but they said they couldn_'_t take the money from my card , so i went online and hit resolve , entered my security details and all went through ok .
negative	reconciling my bank_account a week or so later highlighted that they had charged me twice for the item once on the 00th_november_0000 , once on the 0rd_december_0000 .
negative	i phoned customer_services ( 00_minutes of which 00 were on hold ) and the customer service rep was fairly useless .
negative	they started telling_me that i needed to photocopy bank_statements to prove it .
negative	i bank online i said , they told me to ask my bank to send me a statement .
negative	i was told a manager would call me back in 00_minutes after his lunch , nearly 0 hours_later i am still_waiting .
negative	poor customer service negates discounted prices especially at £ 0 . 00 plus per phone_call to them stick to amazon , play or hmv all who have very good service , deal with you correctly ( and respectfully ) and have good prices too .
negative	poor customer service is a sure way to go out of business ...
negative	again !
negative	!
negative	i ordered a nz short_sleeve jersey and after 0 days the order was still processing , i tried three_times to e_mail bikeinn but to no_avail , i tried_calling by landline and mobile but ... you guessed it no luck , i submitted a complaint to paypal and lo and behold an email from bikeinn telling_me i had successfully canceled my order ?
negative	i did not cancel any order , however they told me my money was put back into my account , it would take 0 to 0 days ?
negative	after 0 days i again tried to contact bikeinn , suffice to say no reply and no money , paypal had to refund my money in the end ... do not buy from bikeinn , i tracked the order , they source on other_sites and sell to you at a profit .
negative	had a coffee_table turn_up with a black_mark all over it , the customer service people didnt apologise , tried to charge to me to return them and was so unhelpful .
negative	would not recommend this company mainly for the customer service , the product could be better but if they had a decent product and customer service you make allowances .
negative	the final_insult is their people lied to me !
negative	dont_know their own refund policy .
negative	very poor
negative	this website is a scam designed to separate you from your money .
negative	whatever you are thinking_about how good the price or the website looks forget it , it '_s all just a scam .
negative	they have no stock and will only give you the run around , avoid at all costs .
negative	booked a parcel to be collected its still here 0 days_later !!
negative	!
negative	the problem with this company is despite advertising all prices in pounds and having a . co . uk website and a uk telephone_number this company is based in greece and charges your credit_card in euro '_s .
negative	a fact you only find out about at the very end of the transaction .
negative	this has cost me an extra £_000 in foreiogn currency transaction charges - not happy .
negative	i checked to ensure tyre had arrived at fitters , no , called blackcircles and was told it wouldn_' arrive until 0 days_later , just as well i checked as it would have been a wasted_journey to the fitters , 00miles round_trip , without_any update no trye was available .
negative	probably wont use again ....
negative	single rosé on a vase , was for my anniversary and the vase was broken wasn_'_t really happy when i heard this from my partner , 0st time used this service and will be the last
negative	promised an email on a one day with a revised_offer and did not come through to the next_day .
negative	reduced offer of handset when nothing wrong with it .
negative	slow service will not recommend them or use them again .
negative	bought my 00 " hitachi from argos 0mnths ago its now faulty have to take it back and they '_ll send it for repair how long for there not sure up to 00days do i get a tv to use in the meantime ha you must be joking my kids will drive me crazy do the care not a jot cause they have my money and i don_'_t have a leg to stand on .
negative	take my advice when buying a big item stick to a proper company with a proper repair service and proper aftercare .
negative	mes chats ont faim !
negative	!
negative	it would '_ve been nice to be told that the hoses were from 0000 inventory .
negative	as your price was the cheapest , now i now the reason_why .
negative	the current inventory is the new mechanism and hose quality .
negative	so it feels_like i was miss sold a product .
negative	i '_ve_used tooled_up before and they are very good but this experience wasn_'_t good at all .
negative	the delivery and communication was excellent .
negative	wish the product was of new stock
negative	regards
negative	ed
negative	i ordered with a lot of expectation since this was a surprise for my 00th_anniversary .
negative	all the flowers were wilted .
negative	i dont_think i can have the courage to order from serenata again .
negative	sorry serenata .
negative	you have lost a good customer .
negative	having_shopped_around for the best deal on a cycle backpack , i order the one i wanted from trekkinn .
negative	i have a 000 mile cycle for charity in three_weeks so i ordered it in plently of time .
negative	however , i was given a delivery date of 00 / 00 / 00 , which unacceptable given that my order was on 00 / 00 / 00 .
negative	marketing products at a price that undercuts the competition is fine providing trekkinn can actually deliver within a reasonable timeframe otherwise it is a complete_waste of time for all parties .
negative	customer service is rubbish when they get it wrong , keep telling you different_stories and never give you an update .
negative	it speak volumes about their attitude to customer service when a business that receives negative criticism has to resort to personal abuse of the customer who has the temerity to complain .
negative	yes i got angry with them but not without provocation .
negative	their so called " expert ", roy , told me professionally qualified people such as architects are thick and can '_t programme thermostats , it was then i told_him i wasn_'_t thick and quoted my qualification to prove it , he said he was sorry for me .
negative	i think roy was showing a chip the size of canary_wharf there .
negative	the " expert " roy had written to me telling_me how to set_up the thermostat which i duly did and it still didn_'_t work .
negative	what they haven_'_t told you is that it was with those settings that it went off with a bang when " expert " roy plugged it tin to test it .
negative	the simple point the " expert " roy still can '_t grasp is that a thermostat that has_been working_perfectly for 0 months has to have something more than the setting wrong if it suddenly stops working .
negative	they supplied me a replacement thermostat of a different model but the touch_sensitive screen isn_'_t very touch_sensitive , i wont go back to them to listen to " expert " roy tell me its my inadequately stupid fingers that are a fault .
negative	instead i will spend the £_00 or so needed to buy a new thermostat from a more reputable_company , i cant face dealing_with this lot again and receiving more insults .
negative	the lesson i take away is not to ignore negative_reviews as i did in this case from another customer that had a similar experience of the underfloorheatingstore . com
negative	first of all i decided to price match as i found they sell the glasses i want for £_00 less on amazon .
negative	i called and they said they dont price match amazon even_though its them selling it !
negative	they then told me i had to find uk sites that were official sellers and had the product in stock .
negative	i found 0 different sites , in stock and in the uk and sent in my email as requested .
negative	0 hours_later they replied asking me what pair of glasses i wanted ( despite having 0 links to them ) and i responded straight_away .
negative	the next_day i called them late_afternoon as i still hadnt_heard and they said they would contact me the following_day .
negative	0 days_later they responded saying the glasses were now out of stock but if i tried again in around 0_weeks they might have them in stock .
negative	their website says they are in stock and i queried this with them but apparently the website always says they are in stock , its only once you have paid for the glasses that they tell you this and you have to wait .
negative	so they knowingly overcharge people and knowingly decieve people about stock ( that could ruin a late birthday ) and take days to repsond .
negative	the best bit is , that despite having a credit voucher , i apparently wouldnt be able to use that with a price match anyway !
negative	shipped a package 000_miles on their next_day service ( actually uses ups ).
negative	shipment didn_'_t arrive next_day .
negative	ups tracking reports an exception .
negative	called parcelhero and was told that the parcel was delayed because they ' re extremely busy at this time of the year .
negative	fine , i understand that .
negative	i '_m_sure all the courier companies are busy this time of year .
negative	i asked for a partial_refund and was told i couldn_'_t have one because despite paying extras for insurance , i ' d not opted for the money back guarantee .
negative	being a corporate customer of ups , i know that ups will not charge parcelhero full - rate for this .
negative	so , a tidy profit for parcelhero and meanwhile , i '_ve paid for something i '_ve not received ...
negative	in september_0000 i purchased a norco sight 0 from evans_cycles online .
negative	within the first six_months of owning this bike i have had to travel over 000_miles to try to sort this bike out in their cheltenham_store , have had parts changed , a useless service carried_out , which would not look at faulty brakes , and a warranty issue with the frame .
negative	i have been offered no compensation , i have had my integrity questioned and experienced some of the worst customer service around .
negative	their cheltenham_store is under staffed and they cancel appointments for the bike to be fixed with a couple of days notice .
negative	if you are thinking of buying a bike or parts , be wary , i have been left fuming on numerous_occasions and am still_waiting for my bike to be fixed .
negative	you only realise how good a company is when you have a problem and with evans i have just been left cold .
negative	a site whereby , even if you join , you still cannot contact anyone because the intended recipicent has to also be a member .
negative	nowhere is this clearly_stated !
negative	it is like having a postal service that advertises the collection and delivery of mail sent to and from your address ( as this site does when it stats that membership allows the user to ' send and receive email '), however never saying that to do this to other party has to pay a fee , or that the range is limited to a 000km radius
negative	therefore , the obvious questions , as woman between 00 - 00 very rarely join such sites , in what way is the service fit for purpose ?
negative	after three_days of membership , only getting views , which is caused_by others merely scrolling_through the two search features , ' who '_s online ' and ' search ', as well as seeing that you still need to buy ' coins ' to unlock other features , both meaning you never truly know who is interested , i gave up on this useless site .
negative	i wrote to complain_about the misleading claims and suggest they change it as it would benefit everyone , no reply !
negative	£_00 wasted !
negative	what i recommend for this and other website which is set_up solely to take money , is for all members to upload a photo that you have used on other_sites , such as facebook , then it could be found on google image search should anyone be interested .
negative	numerous short positive_reviews all taken within the last few_days , all by members posting their first and only review ??
negative	this is the true specsavers experience :
negative	00 / 00 / 00 whilst looking , the staff were helpful in selection , yet during the finalisation , no mention that i couldn_'_t return them due to disliked or refferal to a larger branch despite knowing i wasn_'_t happy with the second pair !
negative	bought two_pairs - £_000
negative	rimless - didn_'_t fit well , was told it was only a ' little short ' which is wasn_'_t -- exchanged for a second pair
negative	timberland - settled for them -- it had two right arms , one bent to be the left one -- could not do a trade - in or exchange -- i gave it a try , but it proved to be uncomfortable -- the staff in the other croydon branch , north end , said they still won_'_t exchange -- had to do what they didn_'_t even try : manipulated them to fit better .
negative	' we believe that only 000_% happy is really happy "?
negative	?
negative	-- just a belief , as they didn_'_t care that twice i walked out their stores stuck with glasses that i could not possibly have assessed properly in the short time with them prior to purchase ; didn_'_t truly want before and certainly didn_'_t after .
negative	-- twice only recommending that i get another pair ( did the first time - £_00 . 00 )
negative	updated - 00 / 0 / 00 no reply from email i sent on the same day i wrote initial review , wrote to them via fb .
negative	the second rimless are of poor design , they fall off my face with any gesturing and when slightly knocked ; too loose fitting !
negative	updated - 00 / 0 / 00 - from two stars to one , £_000 spend yet still no reply in regards to the complaint !
negative	as with too many companies they care more about the image of good customer service rather_than the implementation of it !
negative	never ever use serenata , they are not customer friendly , deliver sub_standard product and do not compromise with the customer
negative	i ordered handset from three mobile '_s online store , when it didn_'_t arrive on the delivery date i contacted three and was told it would arrive the following_day .
negative	when it still hadn_'_t arrived i continued to call daily only to be told the same thing .
negative	when i finally refused to believe the phone would be delivered the next_day they admitted that the package had actually been lost by their courier , and that i would be issued with a replacement which would arrive in two_days .
negative	several more days passed with no delivery and i called again .
negative	this time when i rang i was told the replacement had not been issued as the item was now out of stock .
negative	at this point i asked for a refund and was told that a refund would be processed immediately .
negative	the following_day i rang again and no such refund had been processed .
negative	this time i insisted on staying on the line until i had been emailed with confirmation that the refund was in process .
negative	not once did three contact me to tell me my that package had been lost by their courier , nor that they had no replacement in stock .
negative	they simply took my payment and did nothing .
negative	it also cost me a fortune in phone_calls to their customer service / tracking line as there was no online tracking .
negative	the refund took_ages , i eventually had to threaten them with a letter of action to even get it through .
negative	just horrible .
negative	the product that i buy has_gone up in price buy 0 pounds . i don_'_t know the reason for this .. but this is no good for customer service .. so i don_'_t rate at all
negative	received a call one saturday saying that they were from orange and wanted to discuss my upgrade options .
negative	i listened and said that i was interested in a deal .
negative	they said they would email me details and send out the iphone .
negative	shortly_after this call i received a call from orange ( who were and still are my provider ).
negative	they said that they hadn_'_t called me and asked whether i gave out my orange password to which i said i hadn_'_t been asked for it !
negative	i then tried_calling back the number that appeared on my mobile but it rang then cut me off .
negative	i tried and tried .
negative	in the end i left it and decided that of any phone arrived , i would refuse delivery and send it back .
negative	in the meantime , i agreed a far better deal with a far better iphone direct with orange .
negative	on the day my new orange phone was due to be delivered , i get a phone from e0 !!!
negative	no emails , no other contact and they don_'_t ( i hope ) have any bank details for me !
negative	i accepted delivery as i thought it was my other phone from orange ( which turned_up about 00_minutes after the e0 phone ).
negative	i called them and looked at an account they sent up on the website .
negative	the advisor was rude and unprofessional .
negative	i have sent the phone back by special recorded delivery at a cost of £ 0 to me .
negative	i am_glad to say that my new shiny iphone_0s is working_perfectly from orange ( no upfront cost to me as loyal_customer to orange !!)
negative	and was a far better deal than what e0 were offering ( iphone_0s )
negative	so don_'_t be_fooled_by the sales_tactics .
negative	don_'_t be_fooled when they say they are from your service provider .
negative	avoid !!
negative	!
negative	ordered some flowers for my wifes_birthday .
negative	order never arrived at work place before it closed .
negative	online operator suggested that my wife and i sat outside and waited for courier .
negative	how rude .
negative	shambles !
negative	this ruined a birthday surprise .
negative	first and last time i use this company .
negative	they are not a florist and don_'_t understand the concept of sending flowers .
negative	avoid !
negative	bought a new vito 0 years_ago .
negative	after 0 . 0 years / 00 , 000_miles , the rear_brakes siezed solid , due to corroded sliders .
negative	took it back to the dealer for repair under_warranty and got a bill for £_000 .
negative	apparently the brakes are not included in the warranty , even for a malfunction .
negative	contacted mercedes uk , who said yes , the dealer was correct the brakes are not covered by the warranty , even for a malfunction , as they are a " wearing part ".
negative	this is my first ever mercedes - needless to say it will also be my last .
negative	just to add to everyone_else '_s bad_experience and hopefully reinforce the message not to use opodo .
negative	i booked internal_flights brazil with tam airlines using opodo , but had to make changes .
negative	i called up and they said the terms and conditions_state it is not refundable or changeable .
negative	i then booked another set of flights for the dates i need and received confirmation from them .
negative	i was shocked to find out when we arrived at the airport in rio that the flight we had booked did exist and our booking never happened .
negative	we missed the game in salvador because all other flights were fully booked .
negative	tam were extremely_helpful and changed the original flights to the dates we needed at no charge .
negative	even more reason to book directly with airlines .
negative	i have learnt my lesson and will never use opodo again .
negative	ordered my goods on 0th_june after ringing customer_services to confirm firstly date of delivery as the seats were needed for a house party .
negative	i was informed that they would be delivered out to me on friday 00nd_june .
negative	on this basis i made the order and my payment was debited from my account immediately .
negative	as the order was still showing as ' processing two_days before delivery i rang to enquire .
negative	i was then told that the items were delayed and that they would not be delivered as expected on the 00nd_june .
negative	i eventually received my order on the 0rd_july almost a month after paying for them .
negative	the communication and after sales customer service has_been very poor .
negative	mortgage broker used citylink to send back passports , which they aren_'_t insured to carry .
negative	citylink lost package , and would not respond to calls or emails until i mentioned the police .
negative	every time someone uses them to send something to me , there is a problem .
negative	a donkey and a pickpocket with adhd would be a more reliable courier
negative	the laptop battery failed after 00 months into a 0 year warrenty and batteries - trade . co . uk would not send a replacement battery .
negative	instead they offered a replacement battery at reduced cost which i reluctantly paid for but it never arrived .
negative	i think they were trying to delay things until a paypal ' claim time ' expired .
negative	i am smarter than them and got my claim in before the deadline date and paypal refunded from their account .
negative	they did not answer mine or paypal emails and so batteries - trade . co . uk should be avoided at all costs .
negative	the name on the company is ' chan chi wang ' and they are not uk_based but honk_kong .
negative	this is the last time i will deal with them or the far_east again as i would rather pay extra from a uk company .
negative	as the song goes my battery was on a ' slow boat from china ' avoid , avoid , avoid at all costs ."
negative	started off great , quickly went down_hill .
negative	they suspended my account without warning or reason .
negative	when i eventually got them to re - instate my account the money i ' d earned had disappeared .
negative	would not recommend .
negative	hi
negative	why are you shopping with very ?
negative	terrible service , don_'_t honour guarantees and cannot answer simple questions .
negative	top turned later than i wanted it and the size didn_'_t fit anyway but no invoice or receipt was enclosed so i '_ve no idea how to send it back !
negative	i bought two tickets to england - france rugby .
negative	i was charged in the region of €_000 for the two tickets and was under the impression that their face value was in the region of € 00 each .
negative	when i received the tickets in the post their face value was € 00 !!!
negative	!
negative	please explain to me how this is not ticket touting dressed up as something marginally more acceptable .
negative	i will never buy through them again .
negative	so so overrated :-)
negative	both items had bulbs smash to pieces , luckily had some spares anyway having bought previous select a lights from keen_gardener .
negative	will opt to buy in b_& q in future .
negative	after booking our trip to barcelona last night 00rd_july and was told because i have a recording that the baggage_allowance would be £ 0 . 00 or 00_euros_per 00 kilos ( 0 bag ) . only to find out this is wrong it will be £_00 . 00 per bag
negative	just got fined for parking in a perfectly legal area ..... see you court .
negative	i '_m an long time user of paypal .
negative	i have a small business and have hit problem after problem after problem after problem after poor customer service ( no customer service )
negative	i was a business stream customer after a couple of months fighting to get the correct bill i decided just to change supplier .
negative	had to go to a lawyer for business stream to even respond ( which they did the next_day when they saw the lawyers letter ).
negative	two years later and they still send me crap through my letter_box .
negative	they are disgusting big business bullies .
negative	they are a private company that masquerades as a public entity .
negative	truly truly_awful company .
negative	from the director of a small wood working business .
negative	so we '_ve been with scottish_power for roughly 0 months in our rented_property ; closed our account to move into our new mortgaged property , and suddenly we '_ve become pariahs .
negative	spoke to 0 different people at sp , trying to sort_out my final payment ( due to their website not working ..... again ) and was told that we owed roughly_£_00 on our final_bill .
negative	i was assured that we would receive a final_bill within 0 working_days for us to check amounts and pay debit off .
negative	we didn_'_t receive anything .
negative	took it into my own hands to try and use their my final account payment service , and yet every_single time i tried over 0_weeks it was " temporarily_unavailable ".
negative	then out of the blue we received a final demand ( red bar and everything ) telling us that we owe them over £_000 and if we don_'_t pay then it could go to court .
negative	i rang them up to try and find out why we suddenly owed them over 00 pound more than originally , and got bounced between 0 very unprofessional , and down - right rude , members of staff ( including a " manager " who offered me £_00 compensation for the trouble ).
negative	i politely requested that he jog - on , and told_him to send me a final_bill , and i would pay the full_amount , leaving their services immediately afterwards .
negative	i gave him my address ( again ) to confirm and was told that the bill would be at my address within 0 days .
negative	surprise_surprise , i have now received a demand ( on the sp website ) from a collections company basically telling my to pay up or else .
negative	oh , and in addition , some pleasant girl at sp actually locked me out of my account by resetting my password instead of the final account payment system .
negative	truly_terrible service , and i will be contacting their head_office and making a formal_complaint about their service , their company and their staff as a whole .
negative	so i ordered flowers for my girlfriends_birthday .
negative	when ordering the flowers at no point does it state they are delivered by yodel !!!!
negative	i would never ever use this company !
negative	how you can spend x amount on flowers , for them to be delivered in a box , that look half_dead on arrival !
negative	to try and get hold of someone on the phone at this company is near_impossible !!!
negative	the question is , why would a florist feel its ok to chuck some flowers in a box , then have them out for delivery for over 0 hours in the back of a van !
negative	?
negative	the personalised card was also atrocious , a label that is printed out and just stuck in a card , not even straight with the corners half peeled_off !
negative	if i could upload_photos at the state of these flowers to deter future buyers i would , my advise to people is to look for local_florists near the recipient .
negative	the product was not packed properly so on arrival all the product had leaked in the box . it was for next_day delivery but this did not happen as it was for a birthday . on a up note your staff were very good and a full_refund accepted .
negative	the cars are cheap and the service is awful they advertise things that are not on the car . you pick the car up nobody takes you around the car to explain how things work all they say is if you drive it away its your problem .
negative	first and last time i will ever buy with the car shop .
negative	we placed an order last_week and ordered a meal from one of the express delivery guarantee takeaways , unfortunately , the meal didn_'_t arrive within the 00_minutes guarantee but actually arrived in 00 - 00_minutes , while there was a missing item and the food and sauces were spilled throughout the bag .
negative	after_speaking to someone about this via_livechat , they informed me without giving a reason that we did not qualify for the express delivery and it was only 0 minutes late , i don_'_t know how bad his maths is but i did get an inclination that he can '_t add up , as it was 00 - 00_minutes late .
negative	he also tried to tell me that the missing item wasn_'_t supposed to be delivered , yet another member of staff looked at the order and confirmed we were supposed to receive the missing item as it was clear that it was part of the set menu .
negative	the food was also spilled all over the bag , yet he told me that he doesn_'_t care .
negative	when i did speak to another member of staff , they said the customer service rep didn_'_t follow protocol and i should escalate this to management and they would handle the situation .
negative	as a result , i have now been blacklisted and the correct form of action has_been taken against me for complaining .
negative	i don_'_t know about you but i find this incredibly_rude and i can '_t believe that a good customer has_been banned as a result .
negative	they also told me that other people are being banned for the same reasons , so be careful when using hungry_house and if i could rate this review below 0_star , i genuinely would .
negative	odd how when i review a cd to cassette adaptor from halfords which not only does not work but wrecks my car stereo into the bargain - the one star_review is not published .
negative	did i expect ethical behaviour ?
negative	- strangely yes .
negative	j ' ai commande une aqualarme v0 le soirée 00 juillet .
negative	c ' était livré 00 . 00 mais la boite a etait dechiré et on a l ' impression que_l ' appareil était abimé et donc je dois la refusé .
negative	j ' ai contacté piscine - center sav sur ligne le même jour pour demander que une nouvelle alarme sera remise immediatement parce que_l ' appareil est obligatoire .
negative	je_ne pas reçu aucun reponse sur ligne et donc j ' ai appelé piscine center .
negative	il m ' avait dit que une nouvelle alarme sera remise au plus_tard aujourd ' hui mais a cet moment je_n ' ai_pas recu aucunes nouvelles .
negative	l ' étiquette de poste était sur_la boite d ' appareil .
negative	pourquoi piscine center n ' a pas utilisé aucun emballage de protection ?
negative	c ' etait clair que_la boite a était deja ouvri et que_la boite a était déchiré en ouverture .
negative	pourquoi piscine center le remise en cet état ?
negative	c ' est n ' est_pas raisonable a penser que_la poste a ouvri et dechiré la boite .
negative	ce_n ' est_pas dégâts d ' accident .
negative	pourquoi piscine - center n ' a pas repondu a mon demande sur ligne ?
negative	further to the comments of the furniture_market .
negative	they did supply measurements for the second delivery and it appeared that the delivery would fit .
negative	however , the delivery driver did not even bother getting it out of the van as he said that the back panel was the same size as the one which had not fitted previously .
negative	it would have been very helpful if the furniture_market had told us this in advance .
negative	they knew , as they state in their comments that they had been unable to deliver the opus 0 door .
negative	if the opus 0 door has the same sized back then all the supplying of measurements is pointless .
negative	it '_s simply shifting of responsibility onto the purchaser .
negative	as the review says : any_problems will be your problems , not theirs .
negative	if they knew the panel of the second order was the same size as the first order then how on earth did they think it was going to fit up the stairs ?
negative	original review
negative	we ordered a three door wardrobe and it wouldn_'_t fit up our stairs .
negative	they took it back and charged us , which is fair_enough .
negative	so we tried again with a single and double wardrobe .
negative	prior to delivery we asked them about what boxes it was delivered in .
negative	we were assured it would fit .
negative	it did not .
negative	the delivery drivers ( who ' d tried to deliver the first one ) didn_'_t even bother getting out of the van as they knew the size of the wardrobe and the size of our stair way and that it wouldn_'_t fit .
negative	we were still charged the delivery charge even_though we ' d made strenuous attempts to check it would .
negative	' it '_s in the terms and conditions ' was the reply .
negative	not very impressed as we ' d done everything we could to check before hand .
negative	to add injury to insult , they also tried to charge us an extra £_00 .
negative	overall we paid a load of money because they weren_'_t very specific about the size of the furniture for the first delivery , and then wouldn_'_t take_responsibility for their own advice in the second .
negative	i '_m_sure they ' re fine if it all works , but we had a pretty expensive and shoddy experience .
negative	hide_behind what they claim is french jurisdiction even_though they are delivering into the uk .
negative	if the item is damaged in transit it your fault apparently .
negative	customer service began shouting and abusive stating it was my own fault .
negative	would not allow me to talk and insisted that the matter was closed and they would not communicate further on the matter then began insulting me .
negative	in short i can_honestly_say they have provided the worst experience and customer service in my entire history of ordering online .
negative	buy your products from people who care about your custom .
negative	i '_ll be making a formal_complaint as the lid of the pharma gain product was not secure ( despite the security wrap being still in place ).
negative	not good enough .
negative	not as cheap as parcels to go , in addition , if you have a have a problem they walk all over you .
negative	i '_ve spent a 0k + with interparcel over the last 0 - 0 years for our business , but they are rude and don_'_t appreciate it .
negative	they pushed me away but i saved £ 0 . 00 per unit with parcels to go so interparcels rudeness was really a saving_grace .
negative	this company will rip you off - their communication is non_existent , they take a 00_% cut of any debt and then won_'_t pay it to you for months .
negative	steer_well clear and use a proper collections agent .
negative	i had the misfortune of stumbling_across this company to come and do a garden tidy for my property in clapham , and the people they sent were useless , they didn_'_t know what they were doing , were clearly not trained , and to top it all , i discovered that they are just cleaners posing as gardeners .
negative	they did not speak_english so it was very dfifficult to communicate with them , and they made a right mess of my lawn .
negative	i would steer right clear of them , they should not be allowed to trade .
negative	so trustpilot called us up and decided that it would be a good idea to pay them £_00 . 00 a month for them to call all of our customers so they could review our service , and so that we could respond if we were given a bad review .
negative	if you don_'_t pay them , they won_'_t let you respond to give your side of the story , which doesn_'_t sound very fair to me .
negative	it '_s well_documented that a large_chunk of their reviews are made up anyway .
negative	in my opinion , they are trying to extort money from companies in order for them to be able to give you a right to reply - that '_s not democratic or fair in any way .
negative	if one side has a voice and doesn_'_t have to pay , why should the other be disadvantged ?
negative	i would steer_clear of this website as there is no way to tell if the review is true or not .
negative	all you need to know is never use this company .
negative	very poor .
negative	the site stated that they had several of the drives ( albeit twice the price of other_sites ) i was looking for in stock .
negative	i duly phoned to confirm and placed the order over the phone then .
negative	i balked a little at the £ 0 +_vat but was told that was because it was next_day delivery , so reluctantly i sucked it up .
negative	the following_day i chased the order by phone as it hadn_'_t turned_up by 0 :_00pm only to be put through to customer_services and to be told that they hadn_'_t got stock .
negative	obviously they don_'_t hold stock , they simply try to get their suppliers ' to drop ship .
negative	they said that i should have received an email_stating this , which i hadn_'_t .
negative	i canceled the order .
negative	very disappointed .
negative	d finlayson
negative	i decided to migrate from npower to another supplier in december_0000 and 0 months later they still have not been able to resolve and issue the credit refund whch i am owed .
negative	was on their dual_fuel scheme and back in january received a final gas bill showing over £_000 in credit , 0 days_later a ` for information only ` statement showing £_000 . 00 .
negative	contacted them and told allow 00 days for refund .
negative	no final electric bill arrived nor refund so contacted them again .
negative	told it would be sorted within 00 days which it wasnt so completed their online complaints form which , other than their auto response ` email was completely_ignored .
negative	loads more phone_calls to them and i finally thought i was getting somewhere on 0th_may after spending 0h 00_mins going through everything again .
negative	supposedly she had found , sorted the problem , finalised my account and authorized the refund and informed me this would be in my account within 0 - 0 working_days .
negative	needless to say the refund has not appeared up to today ..
negative	do not believe a word this company says .
negative	in my opinion their whole_operation should be fully investigated by the energy_ombudsman .
negative	every isbn and barcode was rejected stating they didn_'_t want any of my books or cd '_s .
negative	this is not a company i would recommend
negative	very poor service .
negative	no communication .
negative	no phone number to call .
negative	tyre arrived damaged .
negative	still_waiting for tyreleader to collect it and refund .
negative	may be cheap but hassle not worth the saving .
negative	i attended and gave my keys to a man who looked round the car for damage .
negative	i therefore did the same on return .
negative	my car looked as though it had been driven round a field in a rally .
negative	there were additional miles on the clock which meant that someone had used my car without permission .
negative	i do not know why they put mats in every seating position , it clearly_shows abuse of my vehicle .
negative	i have e_- mailed to complain but no response .
negative	do not use this firm .
negative	booked this at 00 . 00 and courier never showed up .
negative	interparcel told me to wait_till 0 , then told me they could do nothing so i should contact tnt .
negative	tnt then said they were never sent the booking .
negative	the guys at interparcel refused to try and help , refused to upgrade telling_me that actually " it is a non - guaranteed service ".
negative	i was told that they would rebook it for the next_day but were not prepared to do anything to placate me or to try and retain me as a customer .
negative	also they would not confirm that the same thing would not happen the next_day .
negative	i would advise anyone who was thinking of using them to not .
negative	stay as far away as possible .
negative	cowboys with no customer service care at all .
negative	people need to stop using myhermes ... fact
negative	numerous_times we have had parcels delivered by myherpes through people on ebay .
negative	the first parcel we had delivered was left in our half full wheelie_bin , the last time ( tonight ) they delivered at 0 . 00pm !
negative	their turnaround time is slower_than me walking the uk coastline and they look after the parcels as well as banger racers look after their cars .
negative	for the love of god people please stop using myherpes !
negative	i '_ve already exhausted myself adding comments to the other reviews .
negative	please see them to get a real flavor of how i feel about this absolutely_appalling company and its derivatives .
negative	i '_ve only found 0 but there are probably more out there ?
negative	they should all be put out of business asap due to their total_lack of honesty and integrity .
negative	they are selling brackets for £_00 /£ 00 /£ 00 & £_000 then sending brackets that are priced at £_00 on their website .
negative	in my opinion they have purchased a consignment of brackets , a00blk which they are unable to sell due to the inherent design faults of only having 0 hole wall - fixings , vertically spaced , with a narrow seating_area .
negative	anyone with any technical_knowledge would recognize that over time the forces acting on the cantilever arms will loosen the fixings and cause the tv to plummet to the floor .
negative	would you trust your £_000 - £_000 - £_000 tv to this set - up - no you wouldn_'_t .
negative	don_'_t get me wrong the bracket ( a00blk ) that was incorrectly delivered to me is a good sturdy piece of engineering , which looks good and functions as it should .
negative	but with the design fault mentioned i would not / will not mount my tv ( 00kg ) on it , without modifications .
negative	which i don_'_t intend mentioning here , as i would sooner see the companies fail ?
negative	with some effort on my part i will make the bracket work but most people do not have the time , energy and expertise necessary to do this .
negative	so the companies concerned : 000rackets . co . uk ; racketsrus . co . uk & tvrackets0u . co . uk will_continue to scam the uk public with their underhanded ; shoddy ; un - principled ways .
negative	unless stopped by you joe_public !
negative	review update 00 / 00 /_0000
negative	email today offering me a different bracket - they must have seen my original review .
negative	if i accept their offer it will cost me £ 0 to send the bracket back .
negative	what do you think the chances of getting the new bracket are ( marks from 0 - 00 ) and what are the chances of getting a refund when i '_ve sent it back ( marks again 0 - 00 ).
negative	i will mark it 0 - 0 .
negative	because i think i will then be £_00 . 00 out of pocket with nothing to mount my tv on .
negative	when trust has_gone - its gone
negative	would you trust them ?
negative	comments please .
negative	review update 00 / 00 /_0000
negative	another email today from 000rackets , they will pay for me to return the bracket and send me another one or give me a refund .
negative	readers i wonder_why ?
negative	has your trust score gone up yet !
negative	mine '_s not still ( 0 - 0 ).
negative	just sent the initial story of to watchdog on their website ( what a bind ).
negative	i '_ve run out of steam tonight so i '_ll leave doing rip of britain ( the 0 fair ladies ) until tomorrow or maybe a weekend job .
negative	did you know that jennie bond is 00 , angela rippon is 00 and gloria hunniford is 00 .
negative	i perhaps shouldn_'_t mention their ages but i was absolutely amazed when i read the article about them .
negative	they have still defiantly got it all - charm , charisma & professionalism .
negative	makes me look and feel about 000 and i '_m only 00 honest .
negative	their customer service is a joke , search online and you will find numerous complaints , i think everyone with problems should log all live_chat end email correspondence ,( the only way to contact nowtv ) and send copies to watchdog , who will then do a feature on them hopefully , highlighting their terrible customer service and thus preventing future customers from signing_up to them and experiencing the headaches existing_customers are going through .
negative	i signed_up to nowtv with a 0 month pass which came with my new tv , this worked for 0 month , then i was unable to access movies , so i created another account and tried to enter the 0 month passcode agiain , which was not accepted .
negative	ii have since been charged on both accounts 0 times in total , for which they have refunded 0 payment .
negative	i am going to make a short video for watchdog highlighting my plight if my issues are not resolved soon , as i do not want others to suffer as i have .
negative	there '_s a problem with my order most time '_s i use this service .
negative	these problems include having the wrong record sent out , or even not having some records sent out .
negative	in the past i '_ve called up to oint this out and have been told that the next time i make an order , the money for the missing record ( s ) will be deducted from my bill , but this has never happened .
negative	i will only use service as a last_resort if i can '_t find what i want elsewhere .
negative	this morning at 00 . 00 am , on the suggestion of a representative of national_tyres , i placed an order for two bridgestone_tyres for my renault_megane .
negative	the order was accepted and i was sent an email confirmation .
negative	at 00 . 00 i was sent a second email_saying that my order could not be supplied , and asking me to ring them .
negative	i was told , when i rang , that the tyres could not be sourced - but that an_alternative could be supplied .
negative	i asked about the alternative and was offered michelins at i quote ' a slightly_higher price '.
negative	this proved to be nearly_£_00 a tyre more_expensive .
negative	i was then told that the money had already been collected , and would be returned to my account within 0 to 0 working_days .
negative	why can it not be returned as promptly as it was taken ?
negative	why was an order accepted when there was no stock available to allocate ?
negative	i think the least i should have been offered was an_alternative at the same price .
negative	i can think of no circumstances where i would use this supplier again .
negative	i am only giving one star because this survey will not allow me to give none !
negative	do not advertise products if you do not have them , will this make me buy from you again ?
negative	0 hours after ordering our food and receiving confirmation of our order , we contacted the restaurant and they said that no - one had contacted them .
negative	we phoned takeaway . com and were told that they had " technical_issues ".
negative	when i pointed_out that their technical_issues didn_'_t stop them taking money from people i was told i was being abusive and that they were ending the call .
negative	unbelievable shower who i will never use again
negative	i am very disappointed and would never use again and will tell the other_landlords at the next meeting never to think of using this company if you need batteries any time soon .
negative	will not reply to emails and phonecalls , basically they have stolen my property .
negative	luckily i am in london soon and will be paying their business address a visit .
negative	i was looking for a hostel in paris at 00pm .
negative	there were only two options_available that night .
negative	i booked the cheapest option for one night using the hostelbookers system .
negative	nevertheless , the booking is until 0pm and then , later on , it was canceled .
negative	i was in the door of the hostel and i can not get in .
negative	i was looking for a place to stay until 0am and in the end i found a hotel very expensive .
negative	how the system allowed to complete the booking after 0 pm ?
negative	cristiano
negative	i have never used this service before as i have stopped wearing_contacts a while ago .
negative	ended_up ordering contact_lenses for only my right eye and then discovered they were the wrong lenses as well .
negative	opened the box to double_check and now i am stuck with them as they won_'_t take returns once opens but the lenses are intact .
negative	a terrible company to choose ,
negative	i paid for next_day delivery , which had my dad '_s gift for his_birthday in it .
negative	it sould have arrived as stated the next_day ...
negative	it came in the evening 0 days_later ..
negative	when i contacted the company 0 times they didnt_bother to reply , thank_god for paypal !
negative	who tried to contact them but were unable to and had got my money back !
negative	having rearranged a whole day to receive delivery after receiving a text saying it would be delivered today ( no time frame whatsoever ) i contacted them on an 0000 number , which is now not supposed to be used legally for after - sales or customer service , to be told that they could only tell me " sometime before 0pm " unless i call back after 00 .
negative	so i called back after 00 , told that they have no way of knowing , cannot contact drivers and do not track their vehicles .
negative	they said it would be " sometime before 0pm " and that they could send a message to the depot but it was pointless as they wouldn_'_t do anything about it .
negative	waited in until 0pm , unsurprisingly nothing turned_up and now the call_centre has closed .
negative	so massively out of pocket for a day not worked and £ 0 worth of 0000 call charges later , i have no idea what is happening or where my parcel is .
negative	utter_rubbish , any company using this awful service should be_ashamed as it truly does reflect back on them too .
negative	( a )( they totally sent me the wrong item )
negative	( b )( they did not enclose a return_label
negative	how can i recover the situation ?
negative	i have written to you and am still_awaiting a reply !
negative	this was 0 / 0 / 00 !
negative	!
negative	just utter_rubbish
negative	sorry to say this as i have dealt_with this company before with no_problems but this time it was a catalogue of errors , thay accept my order confirmation with correct delivery details , then send an email asking if this was a duplicate order which it wasn , t , then deliver to wrong_address anyway then eventually 0 days_later send flowers to correct address . a mothers_day present that arrived very very late . it is an experience i do not wish to go thro again .
negative	i joined and i bought aa insurance .
negative	but it didnt shows up any money in my account .
negative	its just a waste of time it seems !!
negative	!
negative	item ordered ( so - 000000 ) on 00 september and standard next_day shipping service paid .
negative	order arrived 0st october !!
negative	not good .
negative	i am not happy because of your fault i '_ve lost 000 . 00_euros from the first orders !
negative	the first order was paid , the money disappeared from my account i received an e_- mail with orders , but still you say to me that with the money you did not grow !
negative	someone tricked me , and certainly not command you to other customers !
negative	check with quickpark the night before travelling and was to there was no booking .
negative	ended_up paying triple for the parking place .
negative	i posted a parcel that never arrived ,
negative	on numerous occassins i used the stupid chatroom that they are keen on you using , i chatted with 0 ' people ' and still didn_'_t get an answer , the last of which told me that my parcel hadn_'_t been delivered and is now scheduled for tomorrow , that '_s great i said but why did another of your operatives tell me 0 hrs earlier that the parcel had been delivered to a neighbour and a card left which is untrue as well because the recipient was in all day and his neighbours haven_'_t received anything , his reply was " i will send an email to the courier to clarify this " and when will i be told of the outcome ?
negative	within 00_hrs !!
negative	,
negative	i received an email the following_day stating " the driver delivered it so that '_s the end of this enquiry " so i rang them to speak to a ' real ' person , the automated_message stated that the answer time is 00_secs after 0 mins or so i thought they may be lying , i got through to an operative and my only question was " if the driver has delivered it to a neighbour , then which one " that '_s it , that '_s all i needed to know , my reply will be forwarded to me possibly within 00_hrs ,
negative	i was advised to start the claim process , but i have to supply proof that the parcel did not arrive !
negative	!
negative	how can i do that !
negative	!
negative	royal_mail is getting expensive now but they have never_let_me down ever ,
negative	the irony is that i sold some things on ebay because times are tough for everybody at the moment and i am out of pocket , ebay had their cut and paypal and i have to refund the recipient too !!
negative	!
negative	i am a lorry_driver for dhl and take this kind of unprofessionalism personally , this is by far the worst company that i have ever_dealt_with but you live and learn ,
negative	my advice never use this firm for anything ever ,
negative	martin
negative	ordered pool_table , trampoline & table_tennis top on 00 january .
negative	after several booked delivery slots and a total_failure of any of the items to show up , we have now been informed that the company is in some kind of dispute with its delivery company and our items have been impounded by the delivery company .
negative	there is still no_indication as to when the goods will be delivered ( and hasn_'_t been all week ), no manager will come to the phone at uk sports_imports to speak to us , and to top it off , the phone has just been put down on us .
negative	we are in excess of £_000 out of pocket and , as the phone is now permanently engaged , we can '_t speak to anyone to get our money back .
negative	shocking , shocking , shocking .
negative	amazingly awful !
negative	my girlfriends flowers got left out the front of her work and when someone managed to catch the man that delivered them he was very rude , won_'_t be using again and will be telling others not to as well
negative	talktalk are worst company i have ever_encountered .
negative	if you can even call them a that .. no structure .
negative	the automated service is far from helpful .
negative	please visit our site to perform a health check on your broadband_connection ?
negative	astonishing !
negative	your asking the customer to do your job for you .
negative	when you finally manage to figure_out a way to manipulate the automated_system and get you talking to someone ( as if my broadband and tv connection failing didn_'_t warrent some sort of tech team assistance !)
negative	its just as totally dissapointing as the obismal auto service you get for the first 00_minutes of the call .
negative	the facts :-
negative	i have called on 0 separate_occasions .
negative	0 of which i got told promised by ' bhal ' if that '_s how you spell his_name - that i would get a call back from a manager within the next 00_hours ... that was 00_hours ago and i '_m still_waiting !
negative	bit of advice - invest in some proper training for your staff !
negative	i ...
negative	myself ... had to talk your agent through simple first line checks after him asking me to walk back and forth to reboot my router and tv box for 00_minutes .
negative	00_minutes !
negative	if it doesn_'_t work the first time ... its not going to work the 0th or 0th .
negative	both other times i called i got put on hold whilst an agent asked for assistance from ' another agent ' after 00_minutes with no communication i gave up all hope and hung_up .
negative	look , i am not asking for the impossible .
negative	simply for my tv to work - for me to get the service i have been paying for and not receiving for the past 0 months !
negative	!
negative	i '_m_sure offcom will be absoloutly thrilled to look into yet another one of your complaints that are going to go legal .
negative	stay well clear of this company !
negative	i do not like being quoted a price only to find out later that that price depends on certain criteria , i could have easily gone to any ee store and gotten my handset recycled there without having to post it or have any of the hassle of replying to emails etc .
negative	i will not be using you again and you need to be 000_% clear when offering tiered payments instead of hiding it in small_print .
negative	i often use the dover - dunkirk_route , 00 returns in the last 0 years .
negative	prices paid are hardly_ever the same , the dfds system is often faulty , and offers continually change .
negative	i like to travel at 00 : 00 on a sunday , so when i could not book until an 00 : 00 on the monday_morning on the last occasion , i just suspected that the system was again at fault , and knowing that travel on previous ferry is permitted , i turned_up at 00 : 00 at dover , allowing plenty of time for jams on the road .
negative	check in tried to book me on the 00 : 00 , but the system would not allow .
negative	" come_back after 00 : 00 ", they said , but again was refused travel .
negative	i approached the office , and the check - in agent again tried to alter booking to help me , but was unable to .
negative	manager on duty attended , took no heed of my situation and customer record , and told me , " you booked 00 : 00 and that '_s the ferry you will travel on ".
negative	i asked for consideration , as i am a loyal_customer , but manager said " end of conversation " and walked_away from me .
negative	i wonder_if he , the duty manger , would ever like to be treated the same ?
negative	i was at dover 0 hours in the end .
negative	all the other staff were confused as to why i could not travel , and tried to help , it was only the duty_manager who was rude and condescending .
negative	i was upset to be treated so , my whole journey through the night was miserable .
negative	what a shame , he had a good opportunity to help a previous customer , repair a situation , but instead chose to be rude and officious .
negative	be careful that your order is correct in every details as if there are any_problems you will find it difficult to get any response or help
negative	bought a product ages_ago and i kept calling up and one would answer .
negative	rather buy from very . com
negative	bought a expensive toilet_seat online , so i get it delivered and it came broken in the box and in the end it cost me !
negative	! to take it to the shop and now i '_ve got to pick it !
negative	!
negative	pointless ordering it online not happy !!!!!
negative	!
negative	this is a rubbish service unless you love adverts and don_'_t want to watch any programs .
negative	once you '_ve got past the first batch of adverts you can watch a bit of the programme before an ad appears either full screen or in the top left corner .
negative	not really worth the one star_rating .
negative	have totally given up with it now .
negative	ordered 0 tickets to see gary barlow at the royal_albert_hall 0_weeks in advance .. at the cost of £_000 . 00 for standing_tickets , train and hotel are booked at the cost of over £_000 .
negative	its now the night before the concert and i still_havent got my tickets .
negative	after nearly 00 phone_calls they still carnt tell me weather or not to travel to london as it may be a wast of time .
negative	they said they may have to refund me .
negative	i even spoke to them before the weekend but they said rest_assured they will arrive in time .
negative	a complet joke .
negative	this is suposed to be a birthday_present for my wife !!!
negative	!
negative	i ordered category 0 tickets for france v england in 0 nations 0000 .
negative	i was assured they would not be too high or behind the goal .
negative	they insisted on delivering tickets to our hotel in paris which they did .
negative	i expect them to make a profit but the tickets i received were a face value of 00_euros for which i was charged 000_euros each .
negative	a 000_% mark up , extortionate .
negative	the seats were only a few rows from the very top of the stadium .
negative	all attempts to get a response from the customer service department ( a contradiction in terms if there ever was one ) have gone_unanswered .
negative	had they worn balaclavas they would get sent down for this type of " work ".

negative	we were advised to take out a insurance which cost approx_£_00 , we were told by the car hiring compasny in barbados that this was not valid for them and was of no use .
negative	the product never arrived .
negative	i cancelled the order , a refund was agreed but a week_later my paypal_account has not been refunded .
negative	i ordered an expensive synth ( nearly_£_000 ) on a sunday , 0 days before going on tour .
negative	i phoned juno on the monday to see when the delivery was going to be made , and they said on tuesday via parcel_force .
negative	i said that i would be out for 0 hours the following_day , but the synth had already gone out .
negative	i contacted parcel_force to let them know too .
negative	the delivery was attempted when i was out .
negative	i contacted parcel_force and told them not to try and re - deliver the following_day , that i would pick it up from their depot .
negative	they agreed to this .
negative	but when i went to pick it up the following_day i was told it was being re - delivered !
negative	i asked the guy at the depot if it had actually been delivered yet and he said no .
negative	so i asked_him to call the driver to let him know i would be home in 00_mins .
negative	when i got back ( 00_mins later ) i had missed the delivery by 00_mins !!!!
negative	!
negative	as i was leaving the country the following_day juno offered that i could come to their office and pick one up , but i would have to pay another £_000 for it ( re - fundable when they received the sent back from parcel_force ).
negative	i cancelled instead and a full_refund was agreed .... and here i am a week_later still_waiting for my money back !
negative	!
negative	if you are buying an expensive item just go into your local town_centre and pay a little extra for the product as it will work out cheaper_than having to take days off work etc waiting for a delivery .
negative	not even the decency to communicate properly with customers !!
negative	!
negative	i purchased an iten from this company and ( not having used it ) wanted a refund .
negative	lambda - tek would not accept the return and refused to communicate meaningfully , they would not answer even simple questions .
negative	clearly the company prefers not to take returns and makes doing so very difficult .
negative	their packaging for original shipment was not up to the standard that they demand from customers who wish to retun an item , a poor approach with such delicate high - value products .
negative	not a company i feel i can trust .
negative	.
negative	my first time using parts_gateway has not been good . the main_reason was the part i was supplied with was fauly / heavy corrosion and with the incorrect abs lead fitted ( obvious not for my car , i confirmed this with renault who did not recognise part number of abs lead fitted ). i called the supplier rp services who were not very helpfull and said if i return item ( extra_cost of postage ) they would inspect and if found faulty they might return money . as part was needed i sought alternative supply and decide to cut my loss .
negative	i have ordered some after shave from this site , every time i called to ask where it has got to i got a different answer .
negative	today i got an email reply to question as to where my item is .
negative	i was told to read their terms and conditions and they accept no responsibility whatsoever for my delivery as i opted for standard deliver service which incidentally still cost £ 0 . 00 .
negative	i googled them and this appears to be a common pattern , people order goods , nothing arrives , they then try and fob you off .
negative	the last review before mine on this site i would hazard a guess they wrote it for themselves due to all the negatives .
negative	this company does not do customer service beware .
negative	i ordered a dell printer from them as it was the best price i could_find .
negative	i opted for the 0 day delivery option and paid via_paypal .
negative	when the printer had not arrived 0 days_later i called them to enquire it '_s whereabouts .
negative	i was then informed that they had run out of stock and were unlikely to get anymore .
negative	i asked why i had not been informed of this as i was desperate for the printer .
negative	i was just told that they were sorry .
negative	i then sent them an email asking them to confirm that the order and payment had been cancelled , but received no reply .
negative	a couple of days_later i checked my bank_account and noticed that they had taken the payment .
negative	luckily they refunded the money but this is still absolutely poor .
negative	i will never use this company again .
negative	attempt to contact customer_support appears to have been ignored .
negative	due to the low value of the order i couldn_'_t be_bothered to waste time chasing this up .
negative	disappointed .
negative	am fitting booked .
negative	tyres not delivered to fitting_centre till pm .
negative	at centre told my brakes were close dead .
negative	checked them at a friends garage and they ' re fine and will be fine for a few_months .
negative	cowboys .
negative	despite us being in the house waiting for an important delivery , the apc driver made no attempt to deliver our parcel and didn_'_t knock on the door or ring the doorbell .
negative	with a level of stealth that the sas would be proud of , the driver simply popped a non - delivery card through the letterbox , so quietly that it did not even alert our dog .
negative	perhaps we were just expecting too much - after all it was a friday_afternoon and the driver might have been in a hurry to get home .
negative	a cynical neighbour ( also an apc victim ) suggested that pehaps apc vans don_'_t actually carry parcels on a friday - just stacks of non - delivery cards - already filled out .
negative	either way - our ' reward ' was a 00 - mile trip to the local_depot .
negative	definitely not recommended .
negative	i can '_t be_bothered to waste further time on this company by writing a lengthy review so i will just say this : horrendous !
negative	approximately 0 . 0 years_ago , i place an order for about £_000 worth of goods that never arrived .
negative	despite_numerous phone_calls , emails and threats of legal_action , no refund was ever given .
negative	after taking_legal_advice on the situation , was advised that small_claims court was an option but it would be expensive and a waste of my time .
negative	i don_'_t usually bother_writing_reviews of companies , but in this instance felt_compelled to share my experience with others .
negative	i am aware that this happened some time ago , but having read some of the other reviews , it appears that this company is still at it '_s old tricks .
negative	i would consider this ... you may well receive you order , but how will you feel if you don_'_t and fail to get you money back ?
negative	when i access the site to deposit money / make a bet it works just fine .
negative	however , try and log in while your bets are open and in play and its another story .
negative	what '_s the point of an early cash out option on an accumulator if you can '_t access the site to do so ?
negative	beyond ridiculous and should be illegal especially when dealing_with peoples money .
negative	it ' d be like me going into a shop , paying for an item and then not being allowed to take it from the store .
negative	farcical do not use .
negative	we visited our local_store and ordered a fridge_freezer which we were assured would be in stock on 00 july and delivered the following week .
negative	by 00 july we had received no word so my wife phoned customer_services .
negative	it took many minutes for there to be any reply and eventually she spoke to a man who could_find no trace of our order . after some time he decided to transfer us to the branch .
negative	they quickly found the order but said it would now be in store on 0 / 00 august .
negative	the call lasted 00_minutes ( most of the time with customer_services ) .
negative	on 0 august we received a call and it was arranged the delivery would take place on sunday august 00 .
negative	the following_day we received a phone_call saying delivery would be between 0 and 0 and someone would ring 00_minutes before delivery sunday_afternoon arrived and along came a white_van which turned_out to be our delivery .
negative	there had been no phone_call and the fridge_freezer was left in the middle of our storeroom complete with packaging despite our invoice stating that it would be unpacked and all packaging removed . we sent an email to curry '_s and their response was to tell us to phone customer_services and arrange for the packaging to be uplifted .
negative	we emailed back stating we were not prepared to make another long phone_call and that they call us .
negative	this they did and a day was arranged for the uplift .
negative	we duly placed all the packaging on the pavement on the day requested but no uplift .
negative	we eventually took the packaging 00 miles to a recycling centre .
negative	a few_days_later we received a phone message_saying that they had called as arranged but could_find no trace of the packaging .
negative	strange they did not see fit to knock on our door as we were at home all that day !
negative	!
negative	the irony is that another fridge_freezer was offered for delivery after this .
negative	episode 0 we ordered a tablet online and received an email_saying it would be delivered on or before 00 september .
negative	on 00 september we received a further email_stating " due to unforseen circumstances you may not receive the order within the stated_timescale ....".
negative	; on 00 september we called into the local_branch who were unable to help us although they had the tablet in stock .
negative	i asked if they would give me one from their stock but that was not possible .
negative	they could sell me one but not at the internet price , i cancelled my order that same day but not until 00 september was a refund confirmed .
negative	episode 0 - i bought an ipad on november 00 and received an email_confirming i could pick_up the item at the local_branch after an_hour .
negative	this was in the evening so i called into the branch the next_day only to be told they had none in stock .
negative	because of an error the one on display had been recorded as stock .
negative	no alternative was offered so we left .
negative	i was so disgruntled by this i sent an email to the ceo outlining these cases on 00 november .
negative	i then sent him a reminder on the 00th .
negative	i received a phone_call on 00 november from tom who assured me they were taking action to prevent these issues occurring again and it was unreasonable to expect the ceo of a multi_million_pound company to respond !
negative	he offered me £_00 which he then raised to £_00 .. due to all the inconvenience and costs we incurred i declined his derisory offer .
negative	all i want is an ipad which surely should not be too difficult for this " multi - million company " to provide !
negative	the real irony is that a friend did warn us not to use curry '_s , i wish we had taken the advice !
negative	!
negative	i bought a tyre for my land_rover via the tyre_shopper website at a competitive price and arranged to have it fitted the next_day .
negative	an agent from tyre_shopper rang to confirm the purchase and assured me that the tyre was in stock at their partner garage and they were expecting me the next_morning to have it fitted .
negative	the agent requested that i take the credit_card i paid with and some form of id ( even_though the confirmation_email stated that if the tyre was to fitted then id was not required , i informed the agent of this error which he said would be attended to ).
negative	when i went to have it fitted at national_tyres derby square , isle of man on thursday_morning i was told that the tyre was not actually in stock and would be a couple of days .
negative	when i arrived at early monday_morning , i was told that i would have to wait about an_hour before they would be able to look at my tyre_fitting as they had other customer cars to attend to first , even_though they were not waiting for them and had left their cars with them .
negative	i argued that i had actually been waiting since thursday for my tyre not 0 : 00 that morning , ( this was only 0 : 00 ) and that an exception to their , " first come first served " rule might have some latitude as this was my second trip to the garage to have it fitted through no fault of my own , oh in fact it their fault they are wasting my time and money travelling to them !
negative	they insisted that i would have to wait in " the queue " but must have felt_guilty at messing me around and mysteriously they could fit my tyre in about 0 minutes !
negative	tyre now fitted and no_complaints on that score , but the extra journey to have it fitted eroded any benefit they had on cost saving over the other available garage via black_circle tyres and being treated so contemptuously doesn_'_t tempt me to return for other three tyres that i will need later this summer .
negative	i order for the first time from this company on the 0th_feb_0000 .
negative	it clearly_states that the vast_majority of our customers orders reach them within 0 days but allow 00 days for delivery .
negative	today 00 feb_0000 i rang this company to see why my order had not been delivered .
negative	after a 00 minute delay of waiting for an operator .
negative	i was cut_off .
negative	then when i finally got through a guy said he was unable to deal with my issue and put me through to someone_else .
negative	i was told because this product had been so popular there had been a delay and in fact the order had been dispatched today and would be with me in a week as it was coming from holland .
negative	no email to advise of a delay .
negative	goodbye healthspan you will not get another order from me .
negative	<<<<<<<<<<<<<< update >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
negative	................................... 00 / 0 / 00 ...........................................
negative	a bit of hope for you all
negative	just to update you all these_clowns have just refunded me in full
negative	damon the stress you have put all these_people including myself under i hope you have plenty of sleepless_nights in the cells
negative	warning do not use this company they took £_000 from me and never sent my order
negative	they don_’_t reply to any emails at all , i have reported these to south end trading_standards and consumer direct these are getting investigated now by outside forces
negative	you have been_warned do not deal with these_cowboys
negative	i looked on the internet on the monday and ordered 0 square_metres of quarry tiles - this it stated would be delivered around 0 - 0 business days after order .
negative	i ordered after close of play on monday apparently - so as i had builders in i decided to ring and ask on the thursday when they were being delivered .
negative	i spoke to two different people a few hours apart - they could not confirm whether they were in fact in stock or when they could be delivered - i asked what was the point in stating 0 - 0 business days delivery and was told that in fact they needed a whole day to process the order and that if i read the small_print the delivery it was only an estimate - i was insensed - the builders were ready to put the small floor in my porch and they could not build the cupboards until the floor was in .
negative	i immediately cancelled the order and got a reply_stating they would refund my order but it could take 00 days !
negative	i then ordered on thursday_night with [_external_reference_] who delivered friday_morning - this experience has left me totally mad and disgusted - i am yet to receive a refund too and so have contacted trading_standards - not professional or even worth_bothering with this company at all - to make it worse - the refund came through minus £_00 or so - because i cancelled the order - unbelievable they could neither confirm the despatch date or tell me if they were in fact in stock - they would have been outside their delivery date and they have the neck to charge me for cancelling - terrible _ beware !!
negative	!
negative	sent in a customer request 0 day ago , my wife & daughter , were booked into days hotel on the 0th & 0th while i was undergoing a major cancer surgery , the hospital move my operation date to 00th & 00th_may , rang hotel they could not help as it was booked through alpharoom , rang alpharooms , the girl was not interested and told me to make a costomer service request , which i did for the both bookings .
negative	0th & 0th have passed and alpharooms have still not addressed this request ..
negative	delivery , failure to turn_up and damage to our house
negative	our delivery date was arranged and we had received telephone confirmation in the morning .
negative	00_minutes before the end the day we received a call saying that the furniture would not be delivered .
negative	the result to me was a loss of days pay from work for no furniture with the inconvenience of having to take more annual_leave to rearrange a second delivery date .
negative	0nd delivery date 0 pieces of faulty and damaged furniture arrived along with the wrong mattress delivered - a cheaper mattress than what we had paid for !
negative	the milton_keynes shop said they would deliver the furniture and put it in any room we wanted but this is not the case for heavy items such as wardrobes , when they arrived with the oak_furniture they said they would have to arrange another delivery date for a 0 man team to carry the furniture .
negative	the way the furniture is packaged with the base of the wardrobe together with the main part means that the delivery staff cannot lift it due to the excess weight .
negative	the staff had to unpack the wardrobe and because of this removal of the packaging i had to sign a disclaimer_saying that any damage to my house would be my fault .
negative	in the process we received damage to our wooden door and 0 chunks of wood were taken out of our wooden banister .
negative	if oak_furniture_land had packaged the items so they could be carried i would not have had to sign a disclaimer and the damage would not have occurred because the cardboard protection .
negative	0 rd delivery date to replace faulty items was arranged using another annual_leave date .
negative	we received a call to say that the lorry had broken down and would not come .
negative	after complaining they delivered very late in the evening and this resulted_in another day of lost wages .
negative	faulty , damaged furniture , wrong products
negative	0 ) wardrobe
negative	the wardrobe was faulty , damaged , unfinished and showed very poor workmanship with no quality control for the following reasons ;
negative	approximately a 00 cm height crack with a very wide gap , running from the base upwards .
negative	another large crack 00 cm running from the base upwards .
negative	magnetic strips designed to keep the door closed were unscrewed and loose
negative	multiple holes on top where the carpenter had forgotten to fill the holes .
negative	the worst part is the removal_men could see the cracks and faults but kept quiet and hoped i would not notice until after they had gone .
negative	the second wardrobe replacement had one side of the front_door which showed panels and in particular a very dark panel , whilst the right hand door did not have the panel feature , the result is we have two odd doors which do not match .
negative	0 ) mirror - large cracks in two places
negative	0 ) white filler very visible at regular_intervals on oak bed_frame , a large_chunk of wood missing and a split .
negative	an engineer was sent to repair several pieces of furniture , the result another day off lost pay through having to take time off work !
negative	0 ) scratches on a chest of draws - repaired by an engineer .
negative	0 ) the wrong mattress was delivered , customer service said the mattress was no_longer available due to a change in stock , the result is we have had to accept a replacement mattress we did not want .
negative	the worst part was that they tore off the label to hope that we would not be able to recognise that it was the wrong one and a cheaper mattress than what we had paid for .
negative	the furniture is of poor quality and is not due to transportation damage but workmanship .
negative	poor customer service
negative	we cooperated at every opportunity sending photographs and video_footage of the damage a shame customer service did not do the same .
negative	people failed to call when promised - both the delivery team and the after care service .
negative	on repeated occasions i have not been able to get through at all to customer service for over a week and we have received repeated lies and excuses from staff .
negative	result
negative	0 ) 0 days of lost pay through taking annual_leave for failed delivery , replacements and engineers .
negative	expense of making no end of calls to customer service , sending photographs , videos and writing letters .
negative	0 ) damage to the house
negative	0 ) 0_weeks sleeping on the floor without a bed !
negative	0 ) after writing to a senior_member of the management_team and explaining that we will be sharing our experiences with others by uploading videos , photographs and an account of this online , we finally got the problems resolved .
negative	we were offered all of our money back by returning the furniture or offered a gesture of goodwill .
negative	we went for the gesture of goodwill but this by no means covers the loss of annual_leave days , damage to the house , stress or the major inconvenience_caused_by oak_furniture_land and we still have a wardrobe without matching doors .
negative	even with the gesture we spent a considerable_amount of time of chasing this up as at one stage it seemed like an invisible offer .
negative	advice
negative	0 ) stay_away , do not purchase anything from oakfurniture_land
negative	0 ) if you do purchase don_’_t pay in full / upfront as we did .
negative	put it on a credit_card as you have more rights if there are problems .
negative	0 ) if you are expecting goods check the items before they get in your house and refuse delivery immediately if there are faults because it puts you into a stronger position and you are more likely to get a replacement .
negative	if the furniture enters your house faulty they will send out engineers to do repairs .
negative	0 ) take video_footage and photos of the damage and act promptly
negative	we hired a car with holiday_autos who appear to be a uk front for cartrawler . com .
negative	we hired a car with the total costs coming to around £_00 for 0 days .
negative	on arrival at the car_hire_desk we had to pay €_000 mandatory fuel purchase that included a € 00 service charge , and had to put on a € 0000 deposit on our credit_card .
negative	cartrawler have refused to refund or do anything about it , even_though they were happy to take the money .
negative	hopefully my review will help others avoid being scammed .
negative	i am also passing my complaint to tradingstandards , i advise anyone_else who has had problems to do the same .
negative	i have used holidayautos for 0 years without_any major problems however last weekend i hired a car in pisa using holiday_autos .
negative	the local company was goldcar .
negative	on arrival it took us 0 . 0hrs for the desk to deal with 0 customers .
negative	the reason was all the customers in front were complaining that goldcar were asking for €_000 mandatory fuel purchase which included a € 00 ' service charge ' and a € 0000 holding_deposit on one of our credit_cards .
negative	also the car category was wrong and we were expecting a nissan_juke but got a fiat_000l .
negative	holidayautos have refused to refund the extra_cost and don_'_t want anything to do with the issue even_though we paid via them and they state that there are no_hidden_costs .
negative	if you want the risk of having to pay massive extra costs at the start of your holiday then by all means take the gamble and use holiday_autos .
negative	enterprise , hertz etc dealt_with their customers quickly and painlessly , i will go with them ... i want my holidays to be as stress_free as possible .
negative	fyi holidaysautos is a front for cartrawler . com , check their reviews for the real rating .
negative	my record was delivered damaged and instead of being offered a refund straight_away i was insulted when i was told to provide evidence of the damage .
negative	being a scratch a record this was difficult to ' evidence '.
negative	i am a loyal and regular customer and the question should never have been asked .
negative	an_apology and additional compensation for the inconvenience should have been offered .
negative	the roses arrived limp and with at_least 00_% discoloured petals .
negative	when i emailed photos of the roses as instructed to do , i received an email back informing_me these petals were " guard petals " and to remove them .
negative	stupidly i thought if you send someone flowers they would arrive looking beautiful not close to the end of life limp and discoloured !
negative	i have been asked to send further pictures of the roses if i am still dissatisfied .
negative	will never use serenata_flowers again !
negative	ordered a valentines special of 00 roses , bubbly and choclates and upgraded to the premium which can to £_00 in total .
negative	nothing came on valentines_day and when i spoke to yodel they said they were aware of the problems as iflorist had sent the stock over too late for delivery .
negative	it is now one week_later and still nothing and no reponse from iflorist still .
negative	never ever use these_people as the customer service is extremely poor .
negative	tc
negative	arrived in tenerife followed the instructions given .
negative	no sign of taxi .
negative	asked police , information and other_vendors in the airport but no joy .
negative	spoke to the company providing the taxi on behalf of resorthoppa only to be told they stopped doing_business with resorthoppa 0 months_ago yet resorthoppa took money out of my account 0 days ago .
negative	we were left high and dry and ended_up an_hour of messing_about having to sort our own transport out which funnily_enough was cheaper_than what resorthoppa was charging for the same service .
negative	contacted resorthoppa who appeared to be blissfully unaware that the company they had alleged to have instructed to pick us up stopped doing_business with them 0 months_ago .
negative	the woman at resorthoppa stated she would speak to the director however i am yet to hear_anything nor have i been refunded - yet .
negative	be very wary about paying a company up front for these sorts of services especially when they rely_on a third_party .
negative	i would say there is no after sales service at all .
negative	i received confirmation_email and the details about itinerary only after two_days .
negative	i wrote another two emails to post some questions about the weight of luggage but there is no answer since then .
negative	i am still_waiting answer till today .
negative	[_name_] is the name of the officer who in charge of my email .
negative	i ordered product from easygates and the delivery was fine .
negative	i have had the gate arms 00 months and have a major problem , in that the arm casing has broken ( 0yr warrantry ).
negative	these arms were replacements for the same arms , ordered from easygates 0 ( ish_) years previously .
negative	i have emailed them and they say that the arm has broken due to improper installation - when they were installed in the exact_same geometry as the ones that were there previously !
negative	they have been very slow in responding to my email contact and are being less_than helpful in assisting me .
negative	beware purchasing from them if you may need help after they have your money .
negative	having received the response below , i am staggered !
negative	i only entered a review on trustpilot , out of desperation at not having received a response from easygates , to my email .
negative	i havd tried to call them several_times on saturday_morning ( as i have today at 0 . 00pm ) but simply get a constant unanswered ringing .
negative	for them to reply to my review - yet still not respond to my email , is simply unbeleivable to me .
negative	with regard to my having bough a spare - i purchased two complete swinging gate arms ( seperately ) which cost £_000 each - not what i would call a " spare_part ".
negative	with regard to how the casing broke , i have suggested to them that there are a number of ways this could have happened - not least sub_standard metals used in the manufacture - or a fault in the manufacturing process - to which they have not replied .
negative	as these two arms were fitted to the exact_same fitting points that the previous two arms were fitted ( they lasted for 0 - 0 years ) then one would assume if the fitting is incorrect , then the previous arms should have broken !!
negative	!
negative	i don_'_t realy want to have a public conversation - so can someone from easygates please call me as i have gates that don_'_t open !
negative	!
negative	!
negative	i ordered from this company on 00th_december_0000 .
negative	i write on the 00th and still i have received nothing .
negative	i emailed them on the 00th and received the follwing reply : thank_you for your email .
negative	this is an auto responder email .
negative	your email will be automatically deleted .
negative	i am sorry we are now closed .
negative	i really wish i had read these reviews - as the ones that say " poor customer service " etc are very true .
negative	they initially told me ( when i enquired_about where my goods where , on the 00rd ) to check with the local post_office - however the local post_office have delivered other items that were ordered on the 00th_december , so the issue is not a backlog there .
negative	it is apparent that this shambles of a business simply do not care .
negative	my advice is to use a different company - there are many to choose from .
negative	very poor . didnt send product . took credit_card payment . only defence for company refunded payment few_days_later with no explanation . rang company said they do not deliver to northern_ireland . poorly_designed website
negative	web_site easy to use but service from national_tyres in inverness hopeless phoned day prior to fitting to confirm time as needed to book mot at halfords 000_yards down the road from national site i was given a time 00 : 00 & told fitting & tracking it would take about an_hour to carry out .
negative	contacted halfords & booked mot for 00 : 00 dropped_off car at agreed time & was told that they would not be able to look at car for at_least 0 hour 00 min explained that mot was booked for 00 : 00 was advised they would be able to get his done , bottom_line halfords cold not pick_up car from national till 00 : 00 so they could not do mot had to re - book for next_day this means a further round_trip of 00 mile also tracking is not set right as pulling which means tracking not done .
negative	i would say that this service is not acceptable
negative	stay_away from 0 network !
negative	this company is so bad , they should be banned !
negative	they don_'_t care what they do to you as long as they ' re making money .
negative	i have no connection where i live , so i hardly used their service .
negative	i tried to cancel my contract , but they wouldn_'_t let_me .
negative	i had the phone put down on me 0 times after asking them to cancel my contract .
negative	so i went to the 0 network store and they told me i can only cancel by phone_call .
negative	i told them that i '_m unable to cancel because they keep putting the phone down on me .
negative	i asked them at the store if they could call them and cancel it for me , but they refused and told me to go home and try calling again .
negative	so i decided to go to the bank and cancel my direct_debit to stop 0 from taking more money .
negative	then a few weeks_later , i was getting phone_calls from 0 network about 0 - 0 times a day , pestering me for money .
negative	i told them i '_m not paying for a service i haven_'_t been able to use .
negative	i would have actually paid for the little usage i did have if the didn_'_t put the phone down on me when i tried to cancel .
negative	for that reason , i '_m not paying a penny .
negative	it '_s cost me enough money in phone_calls .
negative	but they didn_'_t listen , they kept calling and asking for money .
negative	i am not surprised there are so many bad_reviews here .
negative	0 network are the worst company i have ever had to deal with .
negative	don_'_t even think about going with them .
negative	avoid !!
negative	!
negative	advertise cheap flights however the baggage excess gets you and when you have a problem the company dont want to know with an overseas customer service centre which costs a fortune to call
negative	extremely poor customer_services quality - worst i ever had in the uk .
negative	they are not interested in the custom whatsoever .
negative	sold goods which apparently they didnt have refunded me months later and when sent them damaged shoes they didnt even bother to look at them .
negative	you would expect more from the company like this but hey they just lost a customer as we are spending at_least £_000 a year on a sporstwear ( or even more if i include cycling_kit ).
negative	not with them anymore .
negative	tried_contacting them via_twitter with same effect - completely_ignored
negative	they simply seem to have their customers deep in their ...
negative	and that seem to be a common topic of most reviews ...
negative	customer_services are worst then i have ever came_across - so poor that i have decided not to buy anything from them ever .
negative	on the top of that when they had a sale they charged me and later canceled my order with no real explanation - again customer_services were only able to tell me to go away .
negative	they might have decent products but uk branch of the adidas is an utter nightmare and their quality it below anything i ever came_across ...
negative	we booked a hotel in benidorm and when we got there we were not booked in .
negative	we had no idea what to do .
negative	phoned alpha_rooms and they had moved us without telling us .
negative	we were moved to a worse hotel without aircon and for the 0 nights no fresh towels or maid service .
negative	we were refused this .
negative	on arriving home i contacted alpha_rooms and they tried to blame a different agent .
negative	alpha_rooms were our agent and said they " tried " to contact me .
negative	tried isn_'_t good enough when your sending people to another country .
negative	no email , no answer phone message .
negative	the final email from the complaint said " i '_m sorry there is nothing we can do ".
negative	at no point did they properly apologise or even admit any blame .
negative	beware !!!!!!!
negative	use travel_republic as they are cheaper and send you to the correct hotel
negative	i booked my room .
negative	firstly , on the booking page i was asked if i wanted to pay a premium to be able to get a refund if i was unable to stay on the date chosen .
negative	personally i think that '_s an extremely unfriendly customer policy .
negative	i chose not to pay the premium as i fully intended to stay , and money is tight .
negative	but unfortunately i was ill , and unable to travel , so didn_'_t stay at the hotel .
negative	i therefore lost all of my money .
negative	without having the " pleasure " of staying at the hotel .
negative	secondly , my cashback hasn_'_t been credited to my account .
negative	it would seem that if you scour the very small_print , cashback won_'_t be paid by premier_inn if the customer is a " no - show ".
negative	so not only did they keep my money for the room that i was unable to occupy due to illness , but they wouldn_'_t even honour the couple of quid in cashback .
negative	so i reiterate - never book a premier_inn room .
negative	i have order 0 jackets and after 0 days they sent me an email that they dont have the order and they are sorry ok no problem but ........ my transaction was pending so i said no warys it will come_back ........ wrong they took the money from my account and surprise i have tried to get in touch for over 0 week send email with no answer from them and then i have found the email of their ceo and told_him what is happing and surprise next_day email from them then after 0 week my money were back i will not recomend them
negative	ordered 0 sets of dumbells , 0 arrived on friday , called to find out where the 0rd was and was told would be delivered on monday .
negative	it didn_'_t arrive on monday , called tuesday and after lots off attempts finally got through and i was told they would look into it , i called back a few hours_later and when eventually got through again , and asked what was happening the phone went dead .
negative	i called again and again and occassionally when he answered and i asked what was going on he hung_up on me , alltogether he hung_up on me 0 times .
negative	totally_unacceptable
negative	booked a parcel with interparcel guaranteed to be delivered in one working day which i need as it was a very important parcel .
negative	ups collected on time but did not deliver for 0 days , interparcel tried to change the terms of delivery and claim that ups keep parcels in their warehouses for a day for no reason .
negative	i know this is not true as i worked for ups for over 0 years .
negative	interparcel refused to honour the money - back guarantee which is basically theft and against the trade description act .
negative	do not use these_crooks !
negative	do not use this appliance place cheap but takes_ages to get to you .
negative	the have no care to ring you and if u try and ring them you are 00_mins at_least on the phone using your money .
negative	they have offered no discount or anything .
negative	the item was showing in stock but was not in .
negative	will never use again totally wrong how a company is run like this .
negative	firstly let_me say the transaction was superb , my new dji000 naza lite quadcopter arrived quickly and they changed an incorrect item without_question .
negative	i had read some very positive_reviews of the company but they were quite old and i can only_assume that now they ' re on the crest of the multirotor wave , they can '_t cope and the customer service has suffered .
negative	i assembled the kit and , when i couldn_'_t get it running tried to get help .
negative	they are very reluctant to talk to you on the phone and eventually harvey sent me an email with a sheet of settings .
negative	he also said i should download naza assistant v0 . 00 .
negative	this wasted a day because i later found that the model i bought won_'_t use this version .
negative	i '_ve now managed to get most of the settings working myself and today tried to get a bit of final telephone help .
negative	i was astounded at the offhand manner with which i was treated .
negative	the lady on the phone said i shouldn_'_t really have bought a kit if i didn_'_t know what i was doing !
negative	she also said that harvey was with a customer who was spending_thousands , so couldn_'_t be disturbed and that i should send an email .
negative	he didn_'_t reply to the last one so i thought it was pointless .
negative	the icing_on the cake was when john ( the director ) said that if it wasn_'_t working_properly then it was due to my lack of experience , because they ' d set_up hundreds of them and had no trouble .
negative	basically , you get a sheet of settings and then you ' re on your own .
negative	if it doesn_'_t work it '_s your fault .
negative	the conclusion of this is that i am deeply dissatisfied with the treatment i have received , i can '_t remember when i have experienced such arrogance and poor customer service .
negative	if you are starting on this exciting new hobby then i would strongly_advise going elsewhere if you are likely to need after sales advice .
negative	i '_m an experienced electronic engineer , designing medical_equipment for the international space station , so it '_s not as if i '_m without relevant knowledge !
negative	i paid full fair for a car from holyhead to dublin , but was informed the hire company would not let_me take the car across on ferry , i paid 00 pound to change ticket .
negative	later i found out that the information was incorrect and that if i paid additinal insurance i could take the car , the ferryline was obliging with the change to the ticket ,,, again costing 00 pound plsu another 00 pound on top of the original full price .
negative	in total i paid 000_pound ti take me an my wife to ireland with a rental car ..... all this was done over the phone from austalia ..... next time i will stay in britain and for get touring ireland .
negative	the cartridges did not work in my printer .
negative	l was adviced to reset my printer to make it compatable with your cartridges .
negative	l have never had to reset my printer before .
negative	i previously left a 0 * review for this company and recommended it to my wife .
negative	what a disaster !
negative	she tried to order 0 tyres on line on 00 / 00 and arrange fitting .
negative	the webpage wasn_'_t working so she used the on - line support and was given a contact number and was told they could arrange this over the phone .
negative	the advisor on the phone told her " we know there is a problem , just give it a few minutes and try again ."
negative	no help - it still didn_'_t work .
negative	she e_- mailed their customer service and was advised that someone would contact her soon .
negative	more than 00_hours_later , no - one had contacted her so she e_- mailed a further enquiry and received the same message that someone would contact her soon .
negative	they replied to the first e_- mail on 00 / 00 and the second e_- mail on 00 / 00 - both 0 days_later than the initial query - this is supposed to be soon ???
negative	i don_'_t think so !
negative	in the meantime , she arranged for replacement tyres to be supplied and fitted by kwik_fit and booked it in for 00 / 00 .
negative	they telephoned on 00 / 00 to say the tyres had arrived and could be fitted there and then .
negative	that '_s what i call service !
negative	this in no way reflects on the service received by the fitters at national - they were fantastic .
negative	national might want to think about how much business tyreshopper might be costing them - this order was almost £_000 .
negative	you took the job on knowing they were to be delivered to a member of staff at a hospital .
negative	she moves around a lot doesn_'_t stay in the same place .
negative	she on her mobile and office were left angry voicemails from the delivery driver .
negative	i find this very unprofessional and out of order !
negative	never use stratford upon avon branch
negative	terrible service and disgusting staff
negative	purchased a tablet online last night , was informed i will get a confirmation_email .
negative	the confirmation_email never turned_up so i rang customer_services .
negative	was told they had received the order , and the payment and asked did i want the last one ?
negative	to which i replied ' well , that is why i ordered it '.
negative	i was then
negative	told it was on the way and i would get a confirmation_email .
negative	again the email never arrived , so concerned i rang again , to be told they were out of stock and they will let_me know when they ' re back in , which could be whenever .
negative	i was told i then had to ring back in the morning if i wanted a refund .
negative	if only i checked here first , i wouldn_'_t have bothered ordering in the first place
negative	simply dreadful service , sent me an imei blocked mobile , then after having me running around to ee then agreed it was their problem and took the phone back , after advising me to send the phone back to them with my original sim_card , they sent me a replacement phone out without a sim !!
negative	then suggested i go to my local_store at my own cost to get a new one .
negative	dreadful !!!!
negative	avoid like the plague .
negative	supposingly delivered but person signed it reception and at wrong post_code so parcel never given to the owner no idea were it gone to
negative	ordered an item on the 0th of jan for my girlfriends_birthday on the 00th , i thought this would be sufficient time for an item to arrive .
negative	it is now 00th of feb and i have still received nothing .
negative	i had to buy a replacement present since it embarrassingly did not turn_up .
negative	i have requested a refund more times than i would like to count .
negative	customer_services replied initially and told me they would be back in touch once they had spoken to the courier , which they never did .
negative	they are now not answering any emails ( other than automated_reply ), i put a post about poor service on their facebook_page which did get a response but they tell me they will have to transfer me as " its not their department ".
negative	this situation is totally_unacceptable and if i do not get a refund soon i will look into taking some legal_action_against them , just out of principle .
negative	well i really dont_know whether to laugh or cry for these_people , i ordered a new line with broadband , sales man spoke to me over the phone on the 00 / 00 /_0000 , he said i will get my land line number within 0 days , it was very critical for us as we needed the land line number urgently , so the condition was to get the number within 0 days , which never happened , on the 00 / 00 /_0000 , no number no welcome_pack neither a text messaged arrived .
negative	contact talk_talk customer help line , spoke to over 00 people , and every_single operator said different things , felt huge contradiction in their system as no one actually know what their talking_about and what they are doing , all we wanted was a land line number which they couldn_'_t manage to provide it to us after 0 days , i have cancelled my order due to the fouls promises and fouls advertisements .
negative	by the way dear talk_talk - you do not ask email address and mobile number for the security purposes , when you are already asked for the order number , bank details , name and the full address including post_code , these are unique id '_s !
negative	when they fail at the first stage which is very simple they will fail on other services too for sure .
negative	i ordered a cart mount for my gps which was sent promptly - that '_s the good bit .
negative	on opening the parcel i found they ' d sent the wrong model so i rang them ( 0000 premium line so i '_m paying to report their error ! )
negative	and was told they would send a replacement and a returns_form by email .
negative	six days_later and still no returns_form so i call them again on the premium line .
negative	they say they '_ll send the returns_form but the item i ordered is no_longer produced so i opt for a refund and return the item with the now sent form .
negative	several days_later a refund appears in my account for the purchase price only and not the shipping_costs or the return postage_costs .
negative	i call them again on their premium line and i am told they are sorry for the oversight and will call me back after talking to the accounts people .
negative	after two more days of waiting , still no call back so i ring the premium line yet again and finally get a refund for the shipping_costs and yet another apology ( bear in mind these apologies are costing me money delivered over an 0000 premium number ).
negative	i now remind them that they have failed to re - credit £ 0 worth of loyalty_points which i had used in the purchase and i then tell them not to bother with the points as won_'_t shop with them again till hell freezes over .
negative	i put the phone down rather cheesed_off and take a hit on the premium line charges because i '_m tired of talking to people who just don_'_t care about customer service .
negative	not once was i offered any form of goodwill_gesture despite having to make a trip to the post_office , 0 premium_rate calls and a shed_load of hassle through no fault of my own .
negative	on a final note avoid like the plague !
negative	don_'_t honour what they say and when complain rude
negative	got pissed_off with crap dispatch times with crc !
negative	so gave global_bike a shot , 0 days_later after i placed my order and still no knee_pads !
negative	merlin and wiggle can get my stuff hear next_day ( free p_&_p )
negative	i ordered a sale price watch .
negative	the company claimed there was a price error and gave_me a choice of pay more or get a refund .
negative	i requested the refund , which has not yet been made .
negative	in my opinion the offer was not honest .
negative	the company took my money , failed to provide the item at the advertised price , and to date has failed to refund me .
negative	if you ' re tempted by their offers - beware .
negative	mislead from the beginning as was quoted £_000 . 00 for my htc one so sent in only to get an email with revised price of £_000 . 00 which i was somewhat surprised so i read terms & conditions got to 0 . 0 gadgets & devices which read as follows
negative	0 . 0 .
negative	gadgets and devices
negative	each item or device sold should match the make and model in the order and meet the following conditions :
negative	working
negative	the gadget / device must turn on and off
negative	the gadget / device must be fully_functional
negative	the screen must be working and intact
negative	the touch_screen ( if applicable ) must not be cracked
negative	the battery must be included
negative	the gadget / device must not be water - damaged
negative	where indicated a fully working charger must be included
negative	so as my phone fitted the criteria was confused why reduced by £_00 so called and spoke to a gentlemen at zoomfish who then stated i should read further down to subheading 0 . 0 which then states
negative	0 . 0 .
negative	we determine the value of your item based on many factors such as its age , make and model , wear and tear and any repair costs .
negative	so i quizzed him about this and why it didnt state this in the 0 . 0 subheader and would it not make_sense to have put this piece of information in at this point but he did not respond and just reiterated subheader 0 . 0 .
negative	i then went on to state that on the 0 may i had declined there new lower offer only to then get a message on my account stating that the phone would not be returned until the 00 may even_though again on their website they state the following
negative	completely safe
negative	other_recyclers will offer you a price on the website and may reduce it when it arrives with them and may charge hefty fees to return your item to you , zoomfish think this is unfair so if you get any information wrong and we have to give you a new price we will send your device back free of charge straight_away no questions_asked if you don_'_t agree with it .
negative	so to add_insult to injury i have to wait a possible 00days for my phone to be returned , doesnt quite seem like straight_away to me .
negative	i did query this and at_least by me calling he has assured me that it will be sent by courier tonight so as long as it does arrive tomorrow will only have been 0days to return and in this period prices have been decreasing on the other_sites , they also do not return any accessories that may have been sent with the phone regardless to whether you take the new offer or not as these are " recycled as soon as the item arrives " i can only_assume i will now have no charger for the phone when it returns
negative	i '_ve ordered from selectspecs three_times - not sure i '_ll try again .
negative	to be fair , when the glasses arrived they were great - no_complaints about the product .
negative	however , getting the glasses was a real headache .
negative	the order was confirmed and a delivery timeframe established .
negative	a week after the estimate delivery ( which was already 0_weeks ) i contacted the company and this is where the disappointment begins .
negative	the customer service agent was terrible .
negative	she agreed it was frustrating , but explicitly stated there was nothing she or i could do .
negative	she left the impression that she was pleased i couldn_'_t cancel the order - because they wouldn_'_t refund the majority of the money , despite not delivering the glasses according to their schedule .
negative	she made it painfully clear there was no information she could give me , and no information she was going to find out - in short she seemed proud to establish that i was on my own .
negative	she refused to assist - all while acknowledging that i should be frustrated .
negative	i felt_like it was a massive waste of time .
negative	the ticketing_system is also useless .
negative	they use stock answers , and sent one to me that referred to adjusting the frame size - when i hadn_'_t received the glasses and was complaining_about delivery .
negative	more frustration !
negative	personally i was surprised that a company that behaves like this was able to establish a 0 *_rating - my experience certainly wouldn_'_t indicate as such .
negative	_____________________
negative	following your helpful comments :
negative	well another argumentative response from selectspecs - please do take the time to read their other helpful missives - as_opposed to trying to solve the problem they '_ve decided to use sarcastic responses to reviews they '_ve asked for ...
negative	typical of the company - and shows exactly how professionally they behave .
negative	0 .
negative	i ordered on 00 / 00 and received the glasses on 00 / 00 .
negative	it was well over your stated deliveries .
negative	0 .
negative	i contacted the company - ticket id 00000 .
negative	your first response was totally unrelated to the issue - i had to ask if you even had read my ticket .
negative	the second response was an_apology for the first response - and didn_'_t help advance the customer service situation whatsoever .
negative	0 .
negative	considering you were kind enough to respond , i thought it was fair to reconsider my review .
negative	however , since my experience with selectspecs isn_'_t getting any better , i thought i should move an initial 0 *_rating down to a 0 * - would not recommend under any circumstances
negative	note to selectspecs :
negative	perhaps spend less time trying to throw question on reviews you solicit ( despite my experience selectspecs invited me to register on trustpilot ) - and instead focus on actually serving the customers who pay you money .
negative	i booked a flight from christchurch ( new_zealand ) to seoul ( south_korea ), with a stop over in sydney ( australia ), for 00th_december_0000 .
negative	i flew successfully from christchurch to sydney , but in sydney i was told by the airline company that my booking had been done but not confirmed by tripsta .
negative	i missed the flight from sydney to south_korea and had to travel in the next_day , which means :
negative	- i missed a dinner with my girlfriend '_s family
negative	- i wasted one day at work , because i had to take that day off
negative	- i lost money because i had already paid for the hotel in seoul
negative	- i had to pay for accommodation in sydney for a night .
negative	- i had to pay for two meals in australia , which are at_least twice more_expensive than the meals in korea .
negative	- i wasted a precious time with my girlfriend , who i can meet no more than 00 days a year .
negative	- all the plans i had for the first evening and the next_day had to be canceled .
negative	not mentioning that i had requested a seat selection to tripsta '_s staff few weeks before the trip , because i could not log in into asiana '_s airlines with my reservation number , but the staff couldn_'_t help me and did not suspect something was wrong .
negative	after_contacting tripsta by e_- mail a few_times , i got a couple of messages saying that " we are still_waiting for the airline '_s contact " and i even got an email with a booking change that should have been sent to another person .
negative	i '_m still_waiting for an explanation and maybe for some compensation .
negative	worst experience ever .
negative	bought an indesit_washing_machine .
negative	web_site said in stock .
negative	said 0 days delivery .
negative	phoned me 0 days_later to tell me it was out of stock and it would be at_least another 0 days before i received it .
negative	bought over £ 0 , 000 worth of goods from argus over last 00 months but they have now lost a customer !!
negative	its the lies that i hate .
negative	if they had told me it was out of stock , i would have chosen another without complaint .
negative	i wonder_how often they do this ?
negative	bestilte for 00 dage siden et lydkort .
negative	fik hurtigt en ordrebekræftigelse samt en mail om at betalingen var godkendt , min_ordre stod nu som " pending ", disse mail er modtaget samme_dag som_jeg_bestilte varen , der skulle_være på_lager med levering 0 - 0_dage iflg .
negative	deres hjemmeside .
negative	siden har prøvet at ringe og skrive mail til_dem flere_gange , men har ingen respons fået overhovedet , så nu skal jeg i banken og spærre betalingen .

negative	i recently_moved and forgot to change the billing_address on my credit_card .
negative	my order was placed on hold because i put the wrong billing_address , which is fine .
negative	what was not fine was that they charged my card before putting the order on hold , and then did not inform_me that the order was on hold .
negative	if it '_s on hold " for my protection " why did they charge the card ?
negative	i had to contact them about 00 days after i purchased the products wondering_why they had not shipped yet before they told me .
negative	i changed my billing_address to match the information i provided and informed them and my order was taken off hold .
negative	they told me one of the items was out of stock and asked if i wanted them to ship the other .
negative	i said yes .
negative	the item never shipped .
negative	they finally got the out of stock item in and claim they have finally shipped the complete order out to me but only after ignoring about three of my emails and taking several days between my last email and their response .
negative	it has_been over a month since i initially placed my order and i '_m still_waiting .
negative	the " track my order " page still lists my order as not having shipped and i have no tracking_number to verify that it is on its way .
negative	the least they could have done would be to use next - day shipping for an order that was placed over a month_ago , but they did not .
negative	i ordered from blackcircles not because they were the cheapest , as they weren_'_t but because they said they could get the tyres to me the next_day and i needed them urgently , only to get a call a few hours_later after it was too late to order elsewhere saying they couldn_'_t and stating what seemed liked a fake excuse ( courier had already left , i think they probably ran_out of stock ).
negative	i asked if they could do anything on the very expensive postage which was £_00 . 00 for what was now going to be 0 day delivery , and that seemed excessive , but they refused to even even try .
negative	and now looking at others feedback , it looks_like this isn_'_t the first time this has happened .
negative	won_'_t be going back for more tyres , will stick to the cheaper place that advertises 0 day delivery and free_postage , as at_least you can plan things for sure then .
negative	in short , delivery times bad , prices bad , postage prices bad , customer_services will just fob you off with a short default reply .
negative	do not use this company if you want anything on time and and don_'_t want to be messed about .
negative	after shopping with them for years and having things sent to my work all this time , i placed a order last_week , they rejected it because my address had 0 letter different ( 0a rather_than 0 , 0a is actually correct but they only accept the incorrect_address ).
negative	it then it took 0 days for the refund to arrive .
negative	i thought maybe it was a one off , but no , i placed another order , made sure the address was exactly the same as paypal expected , so no_problems with that this time .
negative	placed the order over 0 hours before there deadline for next_day delivery as i now needed the part urgently and they still messed_up the order , gave some weak excuse that they didn_'_t get payment until the next_day , funny that paypal says the funds cleared straight_away , so now if i want it i have to wait for 0 more days !
negative	should have just ordered off of ebay where the same part was £_00 cheaper anyway !
negative	i was told by the staff initially that all items where in stock .
negative	after altering the electrics and radiators in 0 rooms to suit the furniture we liked we where told delivery would take 00 days totally_unacceptable !
negative	!
negative	the oldham branch staff ( a lady ) was not at all concerned that we where unhappy , she was extremely blasé in fact rude .
negative	we tried to buy from another supplier but the fact was we liked the product , i decided to bite the bullet and try on buy online only to find the items could be delivered within 0 days which they where .
negative	i like the product but i go to the branch again i will not talk to the untrained sales staff !!!!
negative	!
negative	i was just beginning to trust this company and had placed my third order . received email to say order would be delivered next_day , nothing arrived , no explanation , all day wasted .
negative	i need to know i can trust them to deliver when they say they will and will not be using or recommending them again .
negative	i '_ve ordered tyres through blackcircles for more than 00 years and for a variety of our family '_s cars .
negative	mostly , they '_ve been efficient and cheap .
negative	but twice_now , i '_ve had damage to the wheels of my porsche .
negative	once by a general garage in leeds and again recently by a mickey_mouse , country garage in somerset more noted for its restoration of old sunbeam cars than tyre_fitting .
negative	and therein lies the problem .
negative	when blackcircles uses experienced tyre_fitters they are very good , but unfortunately , the quality of workmanship can be very different with some of their less able fitting_partners .
negative	you have been_warned
negative	i have recently spent a not unsubstantial amount of money on a pair of ray_ban from here , i would normally go to a shop to try on but the on line reviews of this company were favourable .
negative	they use ups to deliver and although i ordered wednesday_evening they promised to arrive by friday , great sun out busy weekend .
negative	so friday comes sun is out ... but iam in as it can be delivered up to 0pm .
negative	at 0 pm i have had a guts full and phone ups who promise me it '_s on it '_s way .
negative	so 0 . 00 arrives but no parcel .. back to ups .
negative	they now say the parcel has encountered a delay and won_'_t be with me until monday .
negative	cheers , great , nice one , the sunniest day of my year spent indoors waiting for sunglasses .
negative	any company that relies on these joker to deliver should be avoided .
negative	awaiting a very expensive tv_stand and paid for saturday delivery , item said out for delivery . because i work monday to friday i can '_t be in for any deliveries . checked again at 0 . 00 pm ( unable to gain timely access ) yet when you call the 0000 number it clearly_states we will deliver upto 0 . 00pm . funny_thing is i live less_than 0 mile_away from the depot . yodel you are a joke this isn_'_t the first time this has happened and i have also emailed the company were i purchased the item from telling them that i don_'_t want the parcel now . i can_honestly_say that before i order anything on line again if the carrier is yodel they can jog on . oh_yes before i forget yodel social_media team if your going to reply to this do me a favour and use your own words rather_than copying and pasting the same old stuff that you put on all the posts .
negative	booked a hire car through holidayautos and ended_up buying their liability insurance which was worhtless as it didn_'_t cover the excesses stipulated by the hire car company .
negative	furthermore , when making the bookings through holidayautos website the key excess information wasn_'_t mentioned .
negative	in essence , they don_'_t have all the key insurance_excess information to hand , therefore tyou are taking a gamble when making a booking ,
negative	won_'_t be using these again ( as well as axis care hire in montpellier aitport - but that '_s another story !!)
negative	my hand was never out my pocket and it had to be deep every time as your ship aint cheap .
negative	never again and i will never tell anyone_else to do the trip .
negative	rip_off .
negative	i was offered £_00 for my iphone 0 00gb .
negative	when they received it they changed it to £_00 due to screen damage - faulty pixels .... i insisted they returned it .
negative	i checked it myself with a microscope and white image - every pixel was perfect .
negative	i then sent to mazuma and they paid full price (£_000 ) with absolutely no_quibble .
negative	there was no screen damage .
negative	the whole_thing appears to be a scam operation and i have no idea why o0 have teamed_up with such an outragous bunch on con_artists .
negative	if i could cancel my o0 contract i would .
negative	shame on you o0 .
negative	you can stick your ' priority moments ' up your proverbial .
negative	ordered an item that i was then told was out of stock .
negative	no explanation and no attempt to fullfil the order .
negative	this was a present for my sons_birthday .
negative	extremely disappointing and a total_waste of my time .
negative	i ordered a pair of spectacles which proved to be of weak and substandard construction - they broke whilst i was putting them on within a week or two of use .
negative	i had never dropped them or subjected them to undue_stress .
negative	selectspecs refused to refund me , instead sending out unsolicited a new pair of glasses .
negative	these also broke within a week due to the same shoddy , cheap chinese manufacturing .
negative	again selectspecs refused to refund what were clearly faulty items , even when i took the case up with trading_standards !
negative	i was advised to take them to court which was obviously not worth it for a £_00 pair of glasses .
negative	if it '_s too good to be true , it usually is !
negative	edit
negative	yes this was an order from 0000
negative	edit 0
negative	actually , i ' d rather have a refund which is what i should have got in the first place , since the replacement also broke .
negative	if not , the review still stands .
negative	we were scammed by the attendant ( vince vega ) at san_francisco airport - he added expensive " optional " extras such as insurance etc despite my expressly asking not to do so as we did not require them ( being already covered by our travel_insurance ).
negative	i queried this charge on the form and he denied it applied to us , and encouraged us to sign quickly .
negative	it transpired it did apply to us and so we had to wait again downstairs to get the charge removed , where a very rude and impatient attendant insisted we must have asked for this before rolling her eyes and removing the charge .
negative	we also had a stealth charge made for the " convenience " of paying in our own currency - again , this was not requested and we were not notified of this ( if we were , we would have declined as our credit_card is free for international_payments ).
negative	so i had to phone up to get this removed .
negative	later we discovered our car had a slow_puncture , we called avis who directed us to a depot some two hours drive away to get the car swapped .
negative	on arrival they had no idea we were coming and had no car available , so we had to drive back in a faulty ( and potentially_dangerous ) car , wasting time and fuel .
negative	calling avis again , we were told that a replacement car would be sent out to us the next_day , and we would be called in the morning to confirm despatch .
negative	no call .
negative	we called to check , and guess_what ?
negative	it was late being sent out .
negative	it finally arrived hours late , having wasted another half day .
negative	truly_appalling service , and i would never ever use these thieving scammers again .
negative	cex '_s policy is , if you have a voucher , you must print it off , and post the voucher to them at your own_risk .
negative	you can '_t enter a voucher_code at the online checkout .
negative	sent my voucher in ' recorded delivery '.
negative	it '_s been signed for , yet i '_ve still heard_nothing .
negative	should sort_out there voucher situation !
negative	always had problems with my signal on talk_talk internet was very disappointed with this as i had to phone nearly twice a week and found nothing was ever done to help the situation .
negative	stuck by the company until my contract ended but when it did i moved on quickly .
negative	ordered a product it did not arrive so i e_- mailed to say so , received a automatic reply confirming_receipt of e_- mail , but still no explanation as to why non - delivery . they say they will reply within_00hrs . it is now 0days and still not heard_anything
negative	last_year we ordered a cooker from appliances_online and was delivered with no_problems .
negative	recently we have had to replace our washing_machine and decided to try the same company again .
negative	however , trying to book online we found that they could not deliver to our area .
negative	this is because we live in the scottish_highlands , part of the uk_mainland .
negative	apparently , after_speaking to one of their customer service advisors it was a recent policy change due to high delivery costs .
negative	strange really as the royal_mail manage , amazon manage and so does most other_companies .
negative	very unfair on ourselves and a lot of other people in scotland .
negative	bought some bad boy gloves from here .. used about 0 or 0 times , fell_apart_from . the . inside and . was . told it . was . down to . wear and tear .. disapointed !
negative	what a load of rubish these lot are .
negative	firstly to get the car sold and of the forcourt .
negative	they allowed my mum to drive the car home untaxed and so uninsured what idiots .
negative	then i have had the car a month and noticed the back valance loose looked underneath and the back crossmember
negative	is bent and split you cant lower the spare_wheel it has_been in a smash ,
negative	back valance shodily replaced to ( con ) seel this damage .
negative	i called into branch where i bought it to ( con ) front them ( worksop branch ).
negative	they all looked ( con ) fused and sheepish .
negative	then atempted to blame me for the damage but if i needed the spare_wheel they could get the prie bar onit .
negative	ha .
negative	ha .
negative	amazingly enough the mot_tester did not pick_up on it ( why ) they were ( con ) fident that it was not damaged when it left the forcourt .
negative	i have informed the finance company .
negative	consumer direct ect .
negative	i will not rest until they accept_responsibility .
negative	avoid these wide boys at all cost .
negative	paymentsense have been double charging me for service charges for 0 months now and still reduce my payments by the service charges which they have already taken !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
negative	!
negative	i genuinely loved these_guys .
negative	i have been a loyal gold member for 0 years and have spent almost £ 0000 in that time .
negative	usually , any issue i have come up against has_been dealt_with quickly and happily .
negative	until yesterday .
negative	i pre_- ordered a generous xbox one launch pack from them back in july .
negative	on friday dpd lost the parcel and confirmed that it was missing to both myself and shopto .
negative	the following_monday i phone shopto in the morning and am told that they are waiting for dpd to confirm that the parcel is indeed missing and they will get me a replacement out that same day .
negative	brilliant i thought , good job shopto .
negative	i phone again at 0pm .
negative	they still_haven_'_t heard from dpd , so i explicitly asked the question : " ok , so two things can happen right ?
negative	dpd find it and deliver it to me tomorrow or they don_'_t find it and you send out a replacement tomorrow .
negative	either way i get one tomorrow .
negative	right ?".
negative	the guy i spoke to ( who subsequently turned_out to be one of the managers ) said " yes , that '_s exactly it ".
negative	ok , cool .
negative	i could rest easy , all is in hand .
negative	at 0pm , i haven_'_t received a confirmation that anything had been done , so i phoned again .
negative	all change .
negative	" sorry_sir , we cannot issue a replacement until the dpd investigation is complete .
negative	this will take at_least 0 working_days ".
negative	hang on .
negative	what ?
negative	what happened ?
negative	this discussion went on for half an_hour .
negative	apparently there was a new policy from upper management that very afternoon that insisted that replacements and refunds cannot happen until the full investigation has finished .
negative	dpd have confirmed it is missing , but as the customer i now have to wait while dpd and shopto argue about what they are going to do for each other .
negative	this is a disgrace .
negative	any other company would have issued a replacement on monday_morning , keeping the customer away from any internal investigation , but no , i have to suffer because their choice of courier lost my parcel .
negative	i insisted on speaking to a manager and one wasn_'_t available .
negative	i insisted on seeing this new policy as i was sure they cant just add policies without informing the customer , none were forthcoming .
negative	i asked to speak to the guy_who had misinformed me earlier , he wasn_'_t available .
negative	in fact , he turned_out to be the same manager that had now become unavailable for me to speak to .
negative	so , sorry shopto .
negative	i am * this * close to never using you again and spreading the word on just how you treat your loyal_customers .
negative	i will be speaking to them again today and will be delighted to amend the review if they change their stance , but i doubt they will .
negative	they '_ve been out 0 times over the last 00 weeks in winstone , glos to install a phone / internet line .
negative	first time bloke came to discuss where the line would go .
negative	fair_enough .
negative	two_weeks_later another guy came on the same errand .
negative	did not know of previous visit .
negative	promised work would begin next week .
negative	three_weeks_later a bloke comes .
negative	can '_t do the work because not ' flat_roof trained '.
negative	hadn_'_t looked at the plans that the first two had written .
negative	promised next week .
negative	three_weeks_later another turns_up .
negative	same thing .
negative	not flat_roof trained .
negative	then it happened again .
negative	unbelievable .
negative	promised another visit " tomorrow or monday ".
negative	that was two_weeks_ago .
negative	completely incompetent .
negative	having used paypal for a number of years i have always thought the same thing .
negative	the layout of their website could be much simpler , the transfer times for payments could be much_quicker ( rather_than sitting on customers money for 0 days to collect the interest on top of the extortinate percentage rate ) and the customer service much_better .
negative	put simply , this business could easily double its revenue by making a few simple adjustments .
negative	without them , even with the power of ebay they will be left_behind .
negative	sent and faxed more security confirmation information than requested and still opodo couldn_'_t deliver .
negative	completely_unhelpful line staff and managers - i wouldn_'_t recommend this lot to anyone .
negative	shame there isn_'_t a zero_star_rating !
negative	everything was fine during my trial_period . but after first payment i lost ability to play any movies .
negative	unable to obtain the licence required to play prtected content .
negative	thats what i was seeing on my screen trying watch a film lol .
negative	contacted them over live_chat thingy , after a short conversation they told me to try again that everything is fine now lol .
negative	still did not work so i got a refund .
negative	waste of time ...
negative	i was lured by low_prices and in the heat of moment i placed an order for canon_eos 00d ( body only ) and some canon lenses .
negative	after hitting " buy " button , the page would load with the message " thank_you for your order ", but no order reference , order details as for items , prices , delivery estimates .
negative	nothing .
negative	on the top of it no email confirmation , absolutely nothing at all .
negative	so it sobered me up and i started perusing their site and reading their terms and conditions , company return_policy etc .
negative	even their website has no security certificate , so who_knows when your details end up .
negative	i wonder about their wares .
negative	are they genuine or are they knock - offs , refurbished or stripped down items , without warranty and so on .
negative	and given all their orders are sent from us , then there is possibility of custom fraud .
negative	you may end up with liability of custom fees and there goes your deal .
negative	i seriously doubt the positive_reviews .
negative	and therefore i canceled the order by email and called my credit_card provider to freeze my account .
negative	if this business is not all out con outfit , then they operate on the edge of the law .
negative	very poor advertised as free next_day delivery when i asked where my drill was i was told they where having problems sorceing it from milwaukee .
negative	if you aren_'_t in possession of the item how can you guarantee next_day delivery ....
negative	the answer is you can '_t .
negative	this was not a luxury item i needed the drill for work as i had my drill stolen the previous weekend .
negative	so the next_day delivery was very attractive .
negative	you would think with a name like pc_world you could buy parts for your pc ..
negative	i went to one of the shops hoping to buy some like the corair ax000 psu .
negative	however , in the shop the whole range of their psu '_s consist of three generic psus .
negative	i have a wider_range to pick from at maplin ..
negative	also , the tech_guy i spoke to was useless .
negative	sputing gibberish about a psu output .
negative	teach your tech guys ohms law & how to use it .
negative	i ordered 0 x packs of dartington wine glasses in january_0000 .
negative	since then , no goods have been delivered , despite china_chaps emailing me on 0 different occasions and with 0 different delayed delivery dates , claiming that the delays were all down to dartington_glass having production problems .
negative	despite my repeated telephone_calls and emails , china_chaps remained resolute that the problem was with dartington_glass .
negative	out of frustration , i decided to call dartington_glass this morning who confirmed that stocks are plenty and no delays should be experienced by anyone , let_alone china_chaps .
negative	in the end , i cancelled my order and placed a new order with dartington_glass direct .
negative	after much angst , china_chaps refunded my money on credit_card , which they took from my account the moment they accepted my order , way back in january .
negative	in my opinion , china_chaps are a very bad company and are not to be trusted .
negative	never again !!
negative	!
negative	update ( 00 april_0000 ) - despite confirming that my credit_card account has_been refunded with the cost of my cancelled order ( advised 00th_april ) i am still_waiting for the refund to appear .
negative	it seems that the money is managed by worldpay and may still be " stuck in the system ".
negative	this all adds to a horrible experience .
negative	never , ever again :-(
negative	i live approx 000_miles from my 00 year_old mum and every year i always send flowers to her for her_birthday !
negative	this year i had a look around and though yes i would use this company !
negative	never again !
negative	the flowers were almost dead !
negative	some did not even have buds on the stalks ... totally_unacceptable and for one i will not ( never ) use this company again !
negative	you cant phone them and they do not reply to emails !
negative	avoid if possible to avoid_disappointment !
negative	i purchased an item from lindy . uk and completed the transaction , including the credit_card approval .
negative	then a few_days_later i was then informed that the item couldn_'_t be sent to south_africa and i should get the item from lindy international .
negative	the item wasn_'_t available on lindy international .
negative	i have been a registered lindy client for ages and lindy know my home address so i can '_t understand_why i wasn_'_t informed as i attempted to complete the transaction .
negative	if you are thinking of using tesco direct '_s collection service , don_'_t bother !
negative	it is the most useless service i have ever used .
negative	' never again '
negative	go to another wab site you will be better off .
negative	i have completely given up dealing_with maplin .
negative	i used to use them as an_emergency supplier for the small_quantities of particular values of components i need for development work .
negative	i don_'_t any more .
negative	their prices are ridiculous , and their sales staff don_'_t know or care about the things they ' re meant to be selling .
negative	their stock is invariably at variance with the data on their computer ( in every branch i '_ve ever been in to ).
negative	i '_ve given up trying to buy anything from them - even in dire emergency .
negative	i can get all the components that maplin sell at less_than 0 / 00th of the maplin price by shopping elsewhere .
negative	that '_s for small_quantities .
negative	when i want to bulk - buy , maplin are often 000 times more_expensive !
negative	please avoid at all costs !
negative	the sooner this company dies off the better for everyone .
negative	please boycott them and shop elsewhere .
negative	virgin took over our local cable tv network from telewest .
negative	telewest were just short of completely hopeless , but virgin actually manage to be worse !
negative	they claim that they can provide a " 00 mb / s " service .
negative	they can '_t .
negative	it '_s seriously restricted at peak_periods , and never achieves the speeds they claim at any time .
negative	worse yet , they have arbitrarily applied download limits ( that are never consistent ), and when their random restrictions kick in , the speed is reduced to 0 / 00th of the maximum that you can get ( which is never as advertised ).
negative	their advertising is probably fraudulent - they fail to mention their random restrictions or that their network never really achieves the advertised speeds .
negative	they are also spectacularly expensive for a poor service .
negative	it is not a fibre - optic network ( as widely advertised ) - bits of it may be , but most of it is the cheapest , nastiest coaxial cable that they could_find , and is rapidly rotting , giving all_sorts of intermittent faults and random reductions in their already compromised data rates .
negative	i gave up after the eighth or ninth major outage .
negative	vm '_s " customer service " assumes that the customer is clueless , and lies to their customers by telling them that there '_s " nothing wrong ", or " it '_s your fault - your computer must be faulty ", usually refusing to progress faults because " nobody_else in your street has complained "!
negative	back when this network was run by cable camden , the uptake in the neighbourhood was 00 %.
negative	their service wasn_'_t perfect , but at_least they didn_'_t lie to their customers !
negative	since the various changes of ownership , less_than 00_% of the households around here remain connected to the abysmal cable " service ".
negative	if i could rate them with 0_stars , i would !
negative	i bought a clearence item stupidly assuming it would be ok to use , when it arrived the expiry_date was 00 / 00 ( over 0 . 0years_ago ), ok so i didn_'_t read the small_print prior to purchase , whatever , i '_m ok with losing the ££!!
negative	my concern is when i contacted them to check if was safe to use was advised " should be " and at " my own_risk ", i contacted several reputable supplements stockists and was advised that products can be consumed past expiry as they are given a shorter shelf_life than actually good for , however after 0 . 0 years that date would have long past , potential risk now outweighs benefit and strongly advised against consuming !!
negative	my fault for not reading ad fully i get that , but should they even be selling products that could have uncertain sides or pose potential health risks and wash their hands of any responsibilities !!
negative	beware profit before safety read carefully !!
negative	!
negative	don_'_t think if a certain type of number is free like 0000 (/ 000 from mobile ) it is free on o0 .
negative	because it '_s not .
negative	it '_s at_least 00p / minute .
negative	in the 0 years i have been with o0 there wan '_t 0 month that i paid the supposed and agreed monthly package price .
negative	you are going to pay at_least £_00 / month more due to calling these numbers .
negative	and you will call these numbers because it '_s raining you don_'_t have a landline and its just a short call to edf energy anyway ... bullshit .
negative	and boy they know this very well .
negative	this is where their business lies .
negative	bastards .
negative	not to mention this brand_new rip_off called " be more dog " or " refresh " where customers ( the stupid ones ) can do an early upgrade if they want to loosing their discounts that would come at the end of their contract .
negative	i mean they do take out a new contract with o0 don_'_t they deserve some discount as against to those who just walked in from nowhere with no history with o0 at all ?
negative	i have been with them for 0 years and i wanted to upgrade as usual 0 month early .
negative	but now i can go eff my self and shove up teh 0 year up my a $$ becuase now we have this brand_new brainstorm of a 00 year_old executive from o0 called refresh and " be more dog " bullshit .
negative	i cannot get any discount .
negative	i will have to pay the price the person would pay who just happened to walk in possibly an illegal immigrant with no checkable personal history or credit_rating or anything people could call background .
negative	he could be a serialkiller for all we know and i am listed in the same category .
negative	it '_s simple .
negative	get the phone you want , pay cash and get a pay as you go sim from any network it doesn_'_t matter just don_'_t get an o0 pay monthly package because you will regret it .
negative	i walked in the other day and the kid (!)
negative	in the branch called me " boss .
negative	i will not start on what else happened that day and the next_day incase an executive would look at this review .
negative	we don_'_t want halifax executives and managers to lose their jobs now do we ?
negative	i am from europe and a company like this would not last for 0 months there .
negative	absolutely_ridiculous people at customer " service " completely_clueless .
negative	calling me " boss "??!?!?!?
negative	what the hell is this a construction site ??
negative	lies all around about broadband_speed , absolute nonsense on my bill , no relevance to required payment and billed quantities whatsoever !
negative	all in all i am not surprised .
negative	the sole_reason i am with them is that its not about the company its about the useless people they hire .
negative	and thats where they are identical to other uk companies .
negative	want your card terminals to be installed in a manner which breaks health and safety regulations ?
negative	want to be given no support , even when the terminals are not working in the manner they were sold to you ?
negative	want to be lied to just so you sign a lengthy contract ?
negative	want to be spoken to in a rude and abrupt manner from so called " customer_services "?
negative	want to be charged for goods you never received nor signed for to be then declined refunds ?
negative	want to wait 0 months for simple complaints and queries to be replied to , to just be told your complaint has_been declined !!
negative	?
negative	then payment sense is the one for you .
negative	my advice is pay the extra penny a transaction and use a reputable firm that deal with technical break downs within 0 hours and are polite and helpful .
negative	if i could give less_than 0_star , i would have .
negative	avoid this company like the plague and ensure you do full back ground checks before you sign anything .
negative	extremely disappointed with the in professionalism of the company .
negative	failed to sliced simple products on time .
negative	in fact , have still not received all the items .
negative	they are for a cancer rehabilitation programme and we had to delay the start due to the lack of these products being delivered .
negative	all other_companies we used provided everytime on time and efficiently .
negative	very very poor
negative	topcashback may be fine if you are only wanting to get a small_amount of money , but once you start_earning larger_amounts they will find a way to scam you .
negative	i make a lot of purchases online and this seemed a great way to get some extra discount .
negative	at first , everything worked_fine and i was able to get payments regularly from them .
negative	however , i stupidly made the mistake of allowing the balance to get high instead of doing regular withdrawals and that is when they decided to scam me .
negative	i am_currently owed around £ 0 , 000 built up over a long period and they are refusing to pay out !
negative	they are coming up with all_sorts of excuses why they can '_t pay out and are asking for all_sorts of personal information which is none of their business .
negative	i have spoken to the merchants directly and they have confirmed they have paid topcashback , so they are sitting on the money and simply refusing to pay it to me and keeping it for themselves .
negative	what '_s worse - customer service are not responding to my emails .
negative	in 0 emails sent over a 0 week period , i have one reply .
negative	" we will look into it ".
negative	legal_action is going to commence from tomorrow morning and i will_continue to namea and shame them throughout social_media until this is resolved .
negative	very poor , ended_up cancelling within a few_days .
negative	hardware never arrived .
negative	when queried i was accused of lying by staff .
negative	they were trying to say i had received router .
negative	spent next few_months receiving bill letters from them despite never having any internet with them at all !
negative	a joke !!
negative	!
negative	when purchasing items online i am actually inclined to check or ask the seller to make_sure the courier is not actually city - link - only used them 0 times and each time has_been nothing but hassle and trouble .
negative	cards not being left , the online tracker not really baring any relation to where the parcel is , actually being home when they noted they " attempted to deliver ", having to drive halfway across the country and that '_s not to mention the time it takes to get through to their call_centre when there is an issue ( which there most_likely will be !)
negative	- i ' d set aside a good hour of your life if you ever want to speak to them .
negative	guess their nickname sums their business practice up the best , just substitute a word beginning with " sh " and ending in " ity " for city and you '_ve got it !
negative	avoid !
negative	bad management , giving out spurious delivery information , out of date working practises , bargain_basement infrastructure , high staff turn over , cutting own throat with internet parcel firms as customers , and the majority of staff not caring a toss possibly make them the worst courier firm in the world
negative	vodaphone are bunch of thieves that can not be trusted their broadband coverage and customer_services are rubbish .
negative	do not enter in a dodgy contract with them as they do not negotiate and will set their debt bully boys on you .
negative	without a doubt the worst company i have had the misfortune to deal with .
negative	a month to receive an sd_card is crazy .
negative	i doubt i would have received it then without numerous_emails and a threat to cancel my order .
negative	believe me , you do not want to deal with this company .
negative	handle broke in first hour , i have sent emails and no reply from victoria_plumbing . very poor service and do not advice anyone to do_business with .
negative	bought a deal on solar garden_lights 00 in total for £_00 - 00 .
negative	saving over £_00 - 00 according to wowcher , however when i checked on the suppliers website ( kingfisher ) these '' expensive '' solar_lights were actually 00p ....... yes 00pence each if bought direct !!!
negative	so my wowcher '' deal '' was not a deal at all .
negative	i have already redeemed the wowcher but not yet received the goods so i emailed them telling them to cancel the order and refund me .
negative	surprise_surprise no reply at all .
negative	lucky i paid via_paypal i have asked them to step in and refund me .
negative	so as they say buyer_beware if it seems too good to be true ...
negative	it probably is !
negative	wont deal with them again custermer service would have been zero_stars
negative	i had purchased my blackberry from the store , my blackberry had a manufacturing_fault so this had to be taken in for ' servicing ', they advised me that this would be back to me in 0_weeks .
negative	0_weeks_later i had heard_nothing , i contacted them and the lady i spoke to was really rude and said that it '_s not their problem and it will still be a further 0_weeks , they never offered me a curtosy phone and when i had asked for my money back for a months line rental as i have not been using the blackberry package they said this was not their fault so they arent going to refund me .
negative	i am not happy at all with this service and have now left phones0u !
negative	still not recieved contacts dont_know if due to post
negative	awfuly awful service .
negative	i cannot begin to vent my anger about these_people .
negative	all they do is lie and when you call back they pretend it never happened .
negative	cannot_believe i wasted £_000 on these_guys .
negative	i would have much rather paid £_00 for a guy in a dodgy repair shop to fix it .
negative	definitely have to expose these criminals .
negative	booked a parcel and i was given the collection time between 00 noon till 0 . 00 pm
negative	waited all this time and no one turn_up to collect my parcel .
negative	contacted to interparcel .
negative	and what ?
negative	shocking custemer service .
negative	complete_joke
negative	then i decided to stop sending_parcels with interparcel . never ever agein
negative	oh by the way i am still_waiting for my refund .
negative	if you want reliablelty stay_away from interparcel
negative	utrolig dårlig service , telenor har ved flere lejligheder gjort det klart for mig , at de er fuldstændig ligeglade med deres kunder .
negative	det_er desværre ikke første gang , at jeg_har haft problemer_med telenor .
negative	for et_par år siden , sendte telenor mig_en prøve på_deres nye 0g - trådløse modem som ville_være gratis den første måned , prøve perioden startede , da_de oprettede mig i systemet , men den blev 0 uger forsinket , – så_jeg blev opkrævet et gebyr og en kæmpe regning .
negative	jeg_har også kørt en klagesag i forbrugerklagenævnet ( som_jeg vandt ), da telenor nægtede at reparere en løs home - knap , da deres eget værksted insisterede først på , at der_var tale om en vandskade , og telefonens garanti derfor ikke var gældende , men ændrede deres vurdering til , at vandskaden var årsag til at home - knappen sad løst (?!
negative	), og_det derfor var min egen fejl det_var forbrugerklagenævnet heldig vis ikke enige i ( det tog godt_nok et halvt år ).
negative	( min brors kæreste havde de samme problem , men var kunde_hos 0 og kig ind_og fortalte om problemet , og_de sendte hende en helt ny telefon med_det samme ).
negative	nu_er_det så tredje gang , jeg_har problemer !
negative	jeg_har i løbet_af de sidste 0 uger brugt et_sted mellem 0 - 00 timer , i forbindelsen med_et køb af_en iphone 0 .
negative	de_har holdt mig hen med løfter om ” snart at få min telefon i hånden ”, mistet mig på ventelisten , sendt mig_en forkert model , ventet på at komme igennem kundeservice , fejlagtigt oprettet mig som kunde , fjernet mig far lister , sendt mig frem og tilbage mellem butikker .
negative	da_jeg luftede denne utilfredsked , fik_jeg blot at vide , at de_havde et hold til at svare på klager på trustpilot og facebook .
negative	jeg_har besluttet at droppe at få min telefon hos telenor , og oprettede mig i går som kunde_hos 0 ( som kan sende mig_en telefon inden for 0 - 00 dage ), og_jeg skal aldrig være kunde_hos telenor igen !
negative	det bliver endda kr .
negative	000 billigere , og abonnementet er væsentlig bedre til_mit behov !
negative	farvel for altid telenor !
negative	ordered a samsung phone , order accepted but remained at that status for ages , then order being prepared for ages .
negative	very difficult to get through to customer service , 00mins on hold .
negative	most emails did not get a reply .
negative	excuses when you could get through were lots of orders for the same phone , however , stock level showed at 00 for most of the period .
negative	they were polite .
negative	emailed to cancel , and that process did happen , and the credit_card has_been refunded ( 0_weeks after order placed ).
negative	if you are not in a rush , might be worth the risk , but vb need to be more honest about their delivery status and stock_levels .
negative	buyer_beware !!
negative	!
negative	bought a dvd_boxset from this joke of a company took a month & threat of legal_action before they refunded me but are the only comnpany i have ever known not to have a phoneline what a joke !
negative	!
negative	paypal are like legalised gangsters for no reason falsely citing a ' security review ' they froze my account then closed it for no valid_reason after i had used it for 0 years with no_problems took 0 months to release my money luckily it was only £_00 but a friend had his businesses £ 00000 frozen for no reason which ruined his business paypal are fraudsters & thieves the government either needs to investigate or close down this disgraceful company !
negative	!
negative	have never ever known a company like ebay who circumnavigate uk law by basing their admin in dublin & finances in luxemborg by doing this they avoid the monopolies commission so they have a almost total domination of the uk auction market so they just basically do whatever they want as they realistically know you have nowhere_else to go the goverment need to stop ebay asap !
negative	!
negative	upon our arrival we were greeted_by a very rude and unwelcoming reception .
negative	i booked us on a half board rate where dinner was served in a street restaurant and not within the hotel .
negative	the service in the restaurant was appalling we waited on the first night over 00_minutes before we even got a drink .
negative	the other three nights the service was sloppy .
negative	internet_connection throughout the hotel was also very poor .
negative	as i booked this hotel through alpha_rooms i hold them entirely responsible they should be_ashamed to advertise such an hotel without prior inspection .
negative	i needed to clear away my old cd '_s and dvd '_s as i need the space so thought i ' d use music_magpie as i ' d seen the adverts and the app looked easy to use .
negative	wasn_'_t too impressed when i made the order on some of the prices but the total was over £_000 so i went_ahead and used the free courier service .
negative	they then took over a month to even acknowledge that they had the order even_though it was couriered in , which i find strange given the order would have been with them the same day it was sent .
negative	i then got an email_saying that they were only paying me £_000 as some of the cd '_s on the order i hadn_'_t sent .
negative	i emailed to tell them this was incorrect and as it was couriered in then they courier must have lost some boxes .
negative	no reply from them and they sent me the cheque for the money .
negative	i emailed again to complain that they ' d lost my cd '_s and what were they going to do about it .
negative	0 month later i got the response " we have completed the order for the full value and you should receive an email in the next 00_hours to confirm that the cheque is due for dispatch ."
negative	i took this to mean that i was getting my order value in full so waited to get the new cheque in the post .
negative	0 month later , 0 further emails unresponded to and i still_haven_'_t got the other cheque .
negative	think i now need to work out how to take them to trading_standards .
negative	avoid this company like the plague ..... h
negative	it is near the public service , don_'_t pay for sky !
negative	very poor customer service , only a computer not human .
negative	they don_'_t care about customers .
negative	also , they over - tax transations , with bouble fees when ebay
negative	im waiting for almost 0 months and they didnt unlocked my iphone and since 00 / 00 / 00 they didnt answer my questions and so , i can '_t get my money back .
negative	they not professionals .
negative	i lost my money !
negative	i sent this message at facebook and they simply erase it
negative	i have not received the payment for this phone .
negative	i orderd my product a week_ago and has still not arrivde yet so not a happy customer
negative	i bought tickets in good faith and found out they were fraudulent when arriving at the event .
negative	i am now taking this up with the police and my bank and will not use viagogo again .
negative	told me my phone was blocked !
negative	had to chase around for a week after a police report which didn_'_t match my phone .
negative	bought 0 beyonce tickets for my wife for her xmas she was over the moon .
negative	paid altogether nearly_£_000 for these tickets .
negative	recieved e_mail from viagogo to say that al is well and that i shall recieve the tickets soon ..... recieved another email to say that tickets were being hand delivered today by 0pm so i took the day off work to make_sure i recieved them .
negative	... no i didnt .
negative	called viagogo to inform them that i have waited in all day and still no tickets ..... they told me they would contact the seller and find out what the problem was ....... they called back and told me tickets have been stolen !!!!!
negative	wtf ...... so now they have said that i have not to worry and replacement tickets will be available for me to pick_up at a local hotel on the day of the concert .... shocking shocking shocking ... never again will i use this company ...... will update this if i get the tickets ...
negative	id is 0000000 ......
negative	yeah there was a problem alright ...... now i have to go to a local hotel on the day of the event to collect tickets !!!!!
negative	!.... from who exactly ?
negative	?.... viagogo will only tell me a rep will be there and not to worry ....... so i have to go to the hotel next to the venue which will be packed due to the concert and find a mystery person ... hopefully they will be holding a very large sign which says viagogo on it ...... either that or i will be asking everyone if they are the rep !!!!!!!!!
negative	!
negative	update .
negative	.. further to another telephone_call with viagogo today which i was told yet again .. not to worry_about meeting a rep at the hotel to collect tickets ... i tried to explain that i was confused as to who and where i was to meet this rep ... told them that the hotel is right next to the venue and that it would be packed with people ... so who is this mystery person i am ment to meet with tickets ??
negative	?.... couldnt give me an answer so i contacted the hotel and was told they know nothing of any ticket collection from viagogo ..... viagogo ... cant_wait to hear your reply on this one !!!!!!
negative	!
negative	would `_nt buy from here ever again delivery late , birthday was almost over before they arrived , over rated bouquet teddy_bear and chocolates missing and there contact / complaint help line were useless with a few very well practised excuses teddy and chocolates will turn_up 0 days latei i ` ve been assured get your bouquet from somewhere_else you ` ve been_warned
negative	products dispatched within 00_hours ?
negative	nope , ordered a pmdg product on tuesday , and now its saturday , still no game or no notification on where the game is .
negative	no email_telling_me whether its been dispatched , no email giving me a refund when i asked for it , purely unacceptable and they basically lied to me !
negative	i '_m going to stick with [_external_reference_], more_expensive ( like £ 0 more ) but at_least i know i will get it !
negative	£_00 pounds for the game , and it '_s still not here !
negative	edit_: forgive my anger , but to pay £_00 and still be waiting for 0 days after ordering , i cannot forgive gameseek for this , and i hope it comes by monday or i '_m getting a refund .
negative	update 00 weeks on from wrens response below :
negative	we are still_waiting for a larder door to be delivered and installed .
negative	i did speak to chris baker the area manager , but he was unhelpful , failed to take_responsibility and also failed to call back .
negative	i believe that my original review below failed to make clear how endemic the poor management and customer service at wren is .
negative	we have purchased at_least 00 kitchens in the last 00 years .
negative	we have had a few problems and been frustrated at times , but these issues were always resolved quickly .
negative	wren is by far the worst kitchen company we have ever had the misfortune to deal with .
negative	they have had at_least seven attempts to get our order right , but we are still 0 items away from a complete kitchen .
negative	we do not know if we will ever get a complete kitchen .
negative	the account_manager has_been disinterested and does not even bother calling back .
negative	the store manager is ineffective .
negative	he is unable to organise , or expedite anything .
negative	he has no idea what is going on and hides_behind that as an excuse .
negative	the area manager is even worse .
negative	he takes no responsibility what so ever and is completely ineffective .
negative	this company is absolutely_useless at communication and customer service .
negative	it now looks_like the wait for the doors will extend to three or four months .
negative	we ordered the kitchen a couple of months in advance this would not happen if they had proper systems and procedures in place .
negative	wren give the impression that this is business as usual for them .
negative	if you don_'_t mind your kitchen being unusable for three_months , by all means buy from wren .
negative	if you want a professional service , then look_elsewhere .
negative	update_: it looks_like the years interest free credit will have run out by the time we have a complete kitchen .
negative	buy your somewhere_else !
negative	!
negative	please ignore wrens reply_below - it just did not happen !
negative	!
negative	ordered 0 lights , so_far have received only two good lights and six damaged lights .
negative	have spent over an_hour at a time trying to get through to their customer service line , but there is no customer service .
negative	i have reported this by email , but they do not bother to reply .
negative	there seem to be far too many reviewers reporting the same experience .
negative	look at the huge number of appalling reviews for this company and make up your own mind as to their true level of customer service .
negative	my advice - for now , avoid this company at all costs .
negative	wait to see if the company either improves its service to , or fails .
negative	forgot to add that i also cut my hand on one of the broken lights - they do not bother to pack them properly .
negative	ps .
negative	i tried the [_private_data_] phone number mentioned below , but it has_been deactivated now . hardly_surprising .
negative	booked a more_expensive direct flight from denver to ny .
negative	ebookers switched it to a flight with one change , without compensation .
negative	cannot find email or phone number for inquiry / feedback under their " customer service " page .
negative	first time trying to use their service , very dissatisfied !
negative	i chose chemist_direct over boots , who never have everything i need online .
negative	after 0 days no delivery from chemist_direct so i called them and spoke to ' andy ' who assured me the goods were being despatched that very day ( amazing coincidence !)
negative	the goods did not arrive so i called again to be told they were being ' part - despatched ' today ( 0 day later ).
negative	i enquired as to why it was ' part - despatched ' and why had i not been notified about this at the time of order , to which they had no answer - apparently i can expect the balance in around a week !
negative	!
negative	as i had ordered various items important to me that meant another lost weekend without the goods i needed so needless to say i will not be using this cowboy_outfit again , and i want the whole world to know about how awful they are !
negative	good shop , very slow send system , 0days are 0days .
negative	i ordered a christmas_gift_card on the 0th of december .
negative	at the time of writing ( 00 / 00 /_0000 ) i still have not received the gift_card .
negative	hof offered no solutions to this on the phone or by email .
negative	had to go in store and purchase another in the mean time .
negative	now they tell me they can '_t give me a refund on the gift_card - even_though it '_s missing with royal_mail ( royal_mail didn_'_t get it until the 00th ).
negative	if they do find it , what good is it to me now ?
negative	!
negative	i pay £_00 plus postage .
negative	then i '_m told i need your fixing spray .
negative	very clever , i '_ll be sure to warn my friends not to bother
negative	i '_ve had sky for 0 and a half months and all of a sudden my signal went one night , sky are saying they cant come out as its a council property and there not insured ??
negative	the council won_'_t come out and check there dish and there telling_me to pay for a 0rd_party engineer to come and sort this out , it '_s an_absolute_joke , the customer service is diabolical , no one wants to help you , they talk over you and just keep saying the same thing as in there reading off a script , that '_s the overseas contact centre and the uk_based ones ,
negative	if i ' d had know they were this bad i would never of gone with them , i '_m not paying for something what i can '_t use so if sky can '_t stick to there side of the agreement never can i !!
negative	!
negative	please anyone_thinking of joining sky don_'_t as you will be disappointed , very
negative	i placed an order with this joke of a company and recieved a confirmation_email through , then few_days_later they have emailed me saying there is a problem with there payment system and its not gone_through , the money has left my account and there saying they havent got the payment , i think this is a fake company and a scam , ive had to cancel my debit_card as the company has my details , please dont order so you dont have to go through the hassle ive had to go through , items are cheaper in your loocal town anyway ,
negative	thanks
negative	the company is an ubsulte joke , there quick to get a uk_based call_centre to try and keep you with them but soon as you have a problem your get through to someone in india who cant understand i word your saying , they sound like robots and keep repeating the same thing as if there reading off a script .
negative	they talk over you and make you irate , i work in customer service myself and find it hard to understand different uk acents over the phone at times so i dont see how the orange exeutives feel that there indian_call centresare usefull , i just cant_wait to see orange go_bust in a few_years when everyone doesnt use them , ive been waiting over 0_weeks formy problem to be resolved and stil not heard_anything ,,
negative	no delivery at allotted_time , no contact to let us know why .
negative	on hold for over 00mins trying to get answers .
negative	the worst back to ocado for me .
negative	0 years a loyal_customer
negative	they renew 00 month_contract without_consulting you
negative	talk_talk let you call them on their premium helpline number and inform you that you are now on a monthly_contract .
negative	so you believe you are good to move to another company - they then state you have breached contract that they never informed you about .
negative	you ask talk_talk for terms of your contract - they state they will have to charge you £_00 and it will take quite a while .
negative	talk_talk then charge you £_000 for breach of contract that customer has not even been informed has_been entered into .
negative	they hide_behind distance_selling contract which leaves customer in the dark
negative	the customer service is terrible - suppose i should of taken the confirmation of monthly_contract with a pinch of salt - as you rarely get the same answer twice to the same question .
negative	to sum_up worst telecom i have ever been involved with .
negative	dont even start to ask about the actual broadband service - drops outs every night , slow downs - they state that they had extra kit in my telephone exchange but who_knows if it worked correctly .
negative	i ordered and paid for two fire_extinguishers , but have only received one .
negative	i have told the company but have still not received the missing item .
negative	i am not pleased .
negative	this company offered the cheaper price by about £_00 .
negative	i took a gamble and placed an order .
negative	it was downhill from that point on !
negative	the item was quoted as ' in stock ' with delivery ' in three_days '.
negative	it took almost two months to be delivered .
negative	note - there is no telephone_number to contact and eqnuire about an order .
negative	there is no address to write to .
negative	there is an e_- mail address , but a complete_waste of time as they don_'_t answer it .
negative	i wrote perhaps 00 or 00 e_- mails_asking for the whereabouts of my purchase .
negative	no replies .
negative	please do not buy from this company .
negative	it just isn_'_t worth the risk .
negative	what if something_goes_wrong ?
negative	the item is faulty ?
negative	you can '_t contact them !
negative	completely_useless .
negative	i would much rather have spent an extra £_00 and bought from a reputable_company .
negative	i also wish i had paid more heed to the other reviews i have now seen on the web .
negative	only bad_reviews everywhere .
negative	faulty items .
negative	incorrect items .
negative	lost items .
negative	unable to contact them .
negative	unable to obtain refunds .
negative	they shouldn_'_t be allowed to carry on business .
negative	do not buy from them !
negative	i hope someone from the company actually read these reviews as perhaps then they might fulfil the order and i will have something to review !
negative	item collected from basildon tues 00rd apr_0000 00 : 00 and arrived at hatfield terminal mon 00th apr_0000 00 : 00 - 0 days to travel 00 + miles ( about an_hour ), presumably the plants stayed in the truck over easter_weekend .
negative	as it has now 000 approx miles to travel ( without accounting for more depots stops ).
negative	000 / 00x0 = 00 days to delivery - shall not be happy if they are only fit for compost heap .
negative	ironically the plants are coming from a company called gardening_express !
negative	!.
negative	yodel tracking does say ' we are sorry , but it appears ?
negative	your parcel has_been delayed '
negative	whilst this website seems to have mostly favourable_reviews same cannot be said for all web review sites .
negative	will comment further on delivery .
negative	this public traded company called ocado must be writing its own review in my humble_opinion .
negative	the pattern that has emerged is that once a bad review is left then you get a follow_up of good reviews of similar sort .
negative	well here is my experience but before i start if you believe that businesses should be fair non discriminatory please boycott @ ocado in the name of what dr . luther king stood for .
negative	well see why .
negative	evidence collated after_contacting the complainants on other review forum suggests that majority as high as 00_% of the complainants had a minority ethnicity background .
negative	so why in modern britain ?
negative	what modern organisation discriminates openly ?
negative	just read for yourself comments on other review sites , company has a draconian culture of ruthlessly segmenting / profiling their customers based on flawed assumptions , customers sent mould bread or best by products , orders cancelled if they presume your are of minority ethnic background ( of which their pathetic_excuse is that you want to export there already expired products ) is that how the cater for the needs of if you the supposedly top 0 %?
negative	your account will be deactivated and you will be asked to submit your council tax bill ( this is invasive and a step too far ), these_guys does not respect peoples privacy , rude customer service and worst still you have 00_% chance of being violated if you are from the minority background these are facts .
negative	today i vote with my feet and raise awareness so you are not humiliated as this cannot be accepted .
negative	look through the statistics it is basically self_explanatory .
negative	i had a three year contract with vodafone and not once did they treat me like a valued_customer until my contract was up , then they pestered me constantly with quite rubbish offers .
negative	when i started the contract i attempted to have my existing number transferred over to vodafone but after two_weeks it wasn_'_t done so i settled for another number .
negative	when i switched to another server i attempted to have my number switched over to my new server but vodafone has not done this and it has_been a month !
negative	i '_ve been without a mobile number for one month !
negative	i begrudge even giving them one star !
negative	i '_ve bought two phones from them .
negative	one for a three year contract and one for a pay as you go .
negative	there were problems with both .
negative	i won_'_t be using them again .
negative	ebay has a dismissive and very ignorant policy against its sellers and encourages buyers to act in horrendous ways by instilling them with all the power .
negative	i began to sell on amazon and quickly became frustrated with the allocated postage_costs on books which does not take into_consideration different_sizes and weights .
negative	this made me have to cancel two sales transactions of a large and heavy book and a five disc and booklet of a music cd box set .
negative	until the company deals with this complexity in a fair manner towards the seller i won_'_t be using it again .
negative	had a nightmare with this company .
negative	we paid for prebookable seats and didn_'_t get them , despite other people sitting in our places , which makes me believe they put up the price of the seat at a later date to see if people would buy , which they obviously did .
negative	they damaged 0 of my bags and called them not fit for purpose , even_though they were as new condition .
negative	they offered me a good will gesture of £ 0 per suitcase , yes three pounds .
negative	i complained and got a letter to say they will see what they can do and would hear within 00 days .
negative	00wks later heard_nothing .
negative	in the end i took them to the small_claims court and won and got a full settlement .
negative	not a single apology throughout the whole dealing_with them .
negative	the call_centre staff are also a bunch of liars and clearly love to annoy people on the phone b y replying to all criticism as " just read our terms and conditions ".
negative	just booked a new holiday for a group of 00 of us and jet0 didn_'_t get a thought .
negative	all my family will avoid these now and as we travel 0 - 0 times a year , they are going to lose out on a lot of money over the next few_years .
negative	management who instruct their staff to deal with complaints like this are not only abusing people but they are also costing the company a lot of money in the long run .
negative	never go with jet0 if you want an easy holiday .
negative	just google jet0 damaged luggage and you will see they are pirates .
negative	was promised 00mb down and 00mb up +- 0mb , on install got 00mb down and 0mb up .
negative	complained and basically got told to take it or leave it .
negative	then it dropped to 00mb down and 0 . 0mb up .
negative	complained and basically told its normal .
negative	ive had such irregular speeds with this fibre_broadband that i am seriously thinking of going to the press .
negative	at night it drops like a stone , their plusnet forum is awash with people having the same problem .
negative	a chap on the same exchange as myself ( alsager ) has identical issues .
negative	we are both told no compensation as the broadband is there to be used , just not as fast .
negative	is that honest ??
negative	my parents changed supplier 0 months_ago , i told them to avoid plusnet , my friends at work are told the same .
negative	you complain and go through to support and the replies you get back are to try this or try that .
negative	its been 00 months now with the same problem .
negative	im getting speeds less_than adsl at night and paying for fibre .
negative	im being_ripped_off and nobody seems to give a damn at plusnet .
negative	my previous_supplier ( sky ) never missed a single beat .
negative	i think you can guess who im going back to when im out of contract , and i will also be going to the small_claims court when that happens to get my money back .
negative	not worth your time let_alone your money , unless ofcourse you really like watching really old movies that no - one has ever heard of .
negative	honestly don_'_t bother , if you like watching movies from this decade or the last , get something like netflix , they actually have stuff worth watching .
negative	( using instant , which is the only useful thing as you cant spontaneously watch a movie if it takes like 0 days to arrive )
negative	the pillow which i ordered took several weeks to be delivered .
negative	this product was not made in the u . k .
negative	i prefer my purchases to be made in this country .
negative	i '_ve been driven to write this review because of how utterly frustrated i '_ve become chasing unsuccessfully an order placed over two_weeks_ago .
negative	at that time the stock was marked " fast delivery on this item " and astonishingly still is .
negative	after a week waiting for the product to be delivered i e_- mailed complete_care shop to be told they were waiting for stock to be delivered to them .
negative	in order that i could buy the product i needed from a retailer who actually held stock , i requested a refund but my e_- mail was ignored .
negative	two_days_later i telephoned and was promised the order would be fulfilled in a few_days .
negative	those " few_days " passed and still the same story .
negative	no order , no refund .
negative	i am disappointed and angry by complete_care shop '_s clear lack of respect for their customer .
negative	ordered cable that was in stock when phoned . ordered the cable (£_00 worth ) and waited for the goods that never came .
negative	purchased a small pv charger ( last one in stock ) did not work credit_note not much good to me .
negative	i am so unhappy with the service provided , on the website they advertise free_postage for orders and have a phone number to call for " assistance " but when asking to order over the phone after clarifying the item i wanted they do not give free_postage , and charge you , when i asked why i was told it was because they have to pay the staff to answer the phone .
negative	this is incredible , and i have never come_across such a thing before and will most defiantly use another supplier now unless this crazy rule is changed .
negative	ordered the lego game for ps0 was told there was 00 + in stock then got info saying they are awaiting stock .
negative	eventually got the game and it was for the wrong console ( ps0 )!!!
negative	rang them up and eventually got through and they told me i wont get refund or replacement untill i send it back to them !!
negative	im treated_like a criminal .
negative	have sent it back and purchased elsewhere , still_awaiting refund !!!
negative	was not offered any compensation / apologies .
negative	merry_xmas gameseek !
negative	after finding some well priced priced i booked with this company handing_over just under £ 0000 for 0 tickets to thailand .
negative	a week_later i get an email_saying my tickets were unable to be issued with no explanation unless i phoned back by 0 the next_day .
negative	phoning around_midday they said my flights had been cancelled - still with no clear explanation .
negative	i asked for a refund which over 00 days_later has still not arrived despite many correspondents .
negative	no replys to emails and very unhelpful on the phone .
negative	e florist totally failed to deliver my order
negative	the new myspace
negative	terrible customer service department who couldnt care less about long_term customers .
negative	new customers get all the deals , existing_customers get shafted .
negative	gone to virginmedia now , much_better
negative	i constantly wonder_how these_guys are in business at all .
negative	arrogant customer service .
negative	unclear terms and conditions .
negative	i will throw a party when this company shuts down .
negative	i bought an ipod_dock from superfi that had to be returned under_warranty .
negative	over a prolonged period trying to get the item repaired or replaced , the staff have been evasive & rude .
negative	i have made several_visits & phone_calls to the shop and have not had a single call back .
negative	never have they taken any responsibility for the situation , blaming in turn the supplier , someone_else in the shop and sometimes even me ..
negative	truly_awful customer service
negative	on website it says we have acailabilty , so i order , next_day i get an d mail saying 0_weeks .
negative	total rubbish , don_'_t waste your time here , go to b_& q
negative	the item was listed on the site but after 0 days i had received nothing .
negative	emailed customer_services who failed to get back to me for 0 days .
negative	when i did get a reply , i was told that the item was definitely due into stock and would be dispatched within 0 days .
negative	nothing arrived , now i '_ve been told the order cannot be fulfilled and has_been cancelled , but i have not received any info regarding a refund .
negative	on the 0th_february you delivered flowers for my wife for our_anniversary i was satisfied
negative	with the delivery time , but i am not satisfied with the length of time they lasted , by sunday
negative	they had wilted not very happy at all , will have to think if i will purchase withyou again as they arenot value for money .
negative	your sincerely

negative	i am concerned because the phone i sent to them has not arrived .
negative	i '_m dubious to be honest .
negative	it would be so easy for them to just take my phone and pretend they never received it .
negative	or they might have misplaced it , or so on .
negative	i '_m dubious because in my entire life nothing i have ever sent by post has not arrived .
negative	never ever .
negative	but i am now reading about this happening a lot .
negative	something is fishy .
negative	so_far their customer_services have told me that it can take up to 00 days for the phone to arrive ... well , if that '_s the case then they need to find out from royal_mail what is going on given that they pay the postage .
negative	now the crazy thing is that while cleaning out my mouse i accidentally clicked a link in their email that said i had not received the postage bag in the first place .
negative	no verification , one stray click did all that .
negative	i have mailed them but i '_m not sure if i just killed the order dead as there '_s no way to revert that action .
negative	great adverts , dodgy experience .
negative	my tickets for the killers at wembley this saturday arrived on wednesday , i have been trying to contact double0 ever_since their phone line does not take messages just says they are very busy and promptly hangs up .
negative	i paid £_000 + for what i thought would be 0 x £_00 . 00 face value tickets only to receive 0 x £_00 . 00 tickets .
negative	i feel i ` ve been stitched up like a kipper with top tier tickets that should be middle or lower tier and unable to speak to anyone about it .
negative	having ordered 0 items costing nearly_£ 0000 , they were delivered when i was working away from home , i came home a week_later and got the items out of the box , my coffee_table had a visible gouge in it and my tv_stand had nails protruding , i sent pictures of the damaged items to customer_services to be resolved , i had a phone_call today off oak_furniture_land saying they will not replace the damages goods as i should have checked the items when they got delivered , i was in the middle of the north_sea on an oil rig at the time , i checked the furniture the day i came home and complained about the damaged items , this is not the way to go on customer_services very annoyed customer michael garbutt
negative	without_doubt the worst couriers i '_ve ever had to deal with and that '_s not just one experience sadly !!
negative	!
negative	i ' d sooner not deal with a company using them rather_than have all the hassle !!!
negative	virgin please take_note , as i won_'_t be re - newing my phone with you in future if you insist on using yodel , yodel !!
negative	more like whistle for it ...
negative	well , i made the same mistake , not once , but twice , will i never learn .
negative	every time my wife or i have a new mobile from virgin , yodel never deliver when they say they will ...
negative	i will only go to a shop in future , and pick it up there and then , at_least it '_s reliable !
negative	!
negative	on our outward_trip we found that the choice of a decent breakfast was disappointing otherwise the trip was ok . on our return trip the ferry was late by at_least 00 min although we were told 00_minutes at book in , we were guided to a position on the lorry deck that was walled at both_sides , when we returned we found it almost_impossible to regain access to our vehicle as a very large lorry was places behind us thereby massively reducing the space down each side to get to our car , my wife had to climb a safety barrier to get through , this was completely_unacceptable as my wife has walking difficulties and struggled to gain our rightful access to our car , i am disappointed at the overall service compared to both p_& o and the now_defunct sea_france , i will probably not use your service in future as it by no means compares to p_& o . i consider our experience as being against health and safety guidance and would advise that you seriously review you loading procedures regarding giving safe and adequate access to vehicles parked on all decks
negative	i can '_t beleive that people want to let each other know what they are having for breakfast or what they are wearing .
negative	what happened to good old_fashioned talking and intermingling ?
negative	after purchasing an expensive product that tasted awful body_building warehouse refused to provide a credit , discount or any form of reduction on a future purchase .
negative	for a company that sells food products over the internet that revolve around taste i find it incredible that don_'_t offer better service for some of the foul tasting items they sell .
negative	we have since found a much_better alternative company that seem to value our custom .
negative	although a legitimate company they will automatically enter you into a reoccurring payment from your bank and make it exceptionally difficult to stop the payments .
negative	if you really want this product go to holland + barrett non the high_street .
negative	i waited in all day ( 0am until 0 :_00pm and someone the rest of the night in case they decided to show up ) and no parcel , only to check the tracking at 00 :_00pm that they ' attempted delivery ' at 0 :_00pm and no - one was there so they left a card for re - delivery .
negative	no attempt , no card , nothing .
negative	this is not my 0st problem with this company and im hoping it will be my last as i am going to ask that anyone but yodel deliver to me from now on .
negative	previous problems include : no attempt , no card , late delivery , unprofessional conduct ( delivery after 0pm in an unmarked car by the agent obviously taking his son somewhere ), etc , etc , etc .
negative	do not use this company if there is another option .
negative	i left bt 0 years_ago because of their appalling customer_services .
negative	all i wanted to do was buy a new line into the house so my teenage_son had his own phone and have my office line moved from the house to a home office i had built in the garden .
negative	however this proved just too difficult for them to do .
negative	well that was the conclusion i came to after 0 months of trying .
negative	there comes a time when even if you wish to stay with a company their appalling behaviour and lack of courtesy is too much .
negative	quite_frankly the worst company i have ever had to do_business with .
negative	tesco are not alone in poor customer_services .
negative	their issue is that its ok to complain_about the product or their staff as they will do what they can to keep your custom .
negative	but if you complain_about their systems , practices or operational methods , you get nowhere .
negative	usually you get a platitude then silence .
negative	it ’_s time to grow up and understand your customers have a brain and will not always agree with your style , management of practices .
negative	i have complained twice and each time nothing in reply , says it all really
negative	so now i get a response asking me to email social . media @ yodel . co . uk .
negative	well !
negative	why can '_t i have a telephone_number to actually talk to someone ?
negative	it '_s what humans do .
negative	it '_s called speaking and expressing oneself .
negative	first thing we do is learn to speak .
negative	if yodel automated telephone system has a problem and the yodel website doesn_'_t work what next ?
negative	if i didn_'_t understand the internet enough to do a search and find trustpilot for example , where would i go ?
negative	who could i turn to ?
negative	yodel are useless !
negative	my mum , who isn_'_t that old , still has an original rotary dial phone .
negative	very chic and fashionable .
negative	yodel automated telephone system ignores her and cuts her off .
negative	so how does she communicate her problem ?
negative	she doesn_'_t have a computer .
negative	so how could she use the automated instruction to look on myyodel . co . uk to communicate her problem ?
negative	too much reliance on automation and not enough understanding of customers needs .
negative	too_busy worrying_about shareholders than customers .
negative	without customers your business doesn_'_t exist .
negative	would i consider sending a parcel using yodel ?
negative	..........
negative	answers please .
negative	in writing , for all to see !
negative	i would not use this company again !
negative	placed an order on the phone for silver_lining flowers the gentleman_who took the order called the florist to see if they could give me the same day service and he said he could .
negative	the flowers were delivered as promised and they were nothing like the flowers described on the website .
negative	when i complained and send the photo and called them the lady on the phone was very rude and asked me to wait for an email to what their decision was got the email and all it said was sorry we cannot do anything .
negative	i have used this company on numerous_occasions but with the service and staff attitude will not use them again .
negative	they have lost a good customer for a bunch of flowers charged at £_00 . 00 that would have cost a mere tenner in the shops
negative	very disappointing
negative	this company use a sub - standard delivery service who cannot be contacted by phone .
negative	in my case , my parcel was left with somebody down the other end of my street ( who i had never met in my life ) who denied all knowledge of it .
negative	the delivery company told me i must try_harder to retrieve my goods !
negative	after several phonecalls to chemist_direct i eventually got the delivery person to come_back three_days_later to find my missing goods and return them to me , though he was very unhappy at having to do so .
negative	even after all that , chemist_direct have offered me no recompense for my wasted time , no after sales apology , nothing whatsoever .
negative	the rating system on this site should have a zero_star option , because that '_s what i would have given chemist_direct .
negative	as it is , there is no way i will ever use this company again .
negative	received terrible service was given the run around for 0_weeks , i was told my items were in stock then when i still didn_'_t have them 0_weeks_later they said they are out of stock and can '_t deliver anyway cause the vans not in my area bearing in mind they had already taken £_000 out of my account !
negative	!
negative	they always knock the price down and take along time sending the money out .
negative	how disappointing to receive broken toy specially paid for to be delivered by christmas .
negative	two boxes housing toy unmarked but internal box and toy both damaged which would suggest toy already damaged when packed .
negative	offices shut by time delivered so not able to get replacement .
negative	ordered flowers for mothers_day to be delivered saturday so as to prevent any delays .
negative	after waiting all day for delivery i get an email saturday_evening saying that the order had to be cancelled as they couldn_'_t find a florist to fulfill the order .
negative	thanks , really made my wife happy after not getting anything for mothers_day from the kids .
negative	great way to run a business .
negative	i went into the shop and asked if i could have glasses the same day .
negative	they said yes if they had the lenses so i asked them to check if they had them for a pair of glasses and a spare pair .
negative	they had and produced them .
negative	i chose frames then had a fitting .
negative	at this point it was getting late so i asked again if i would have my glasses the same day .
negative	they said no because the lab was closed all day .
negative	i was annoyed but agreed to let them make the glasses up for me on the following_monday and post them to me first_class .
negative	the lenses were with the frames when i left the shop .
negative	the following wednesday i rang to check they had posted the glasses to me .
negative	they said they hadn_'_t because they only had lenses to make up one pair and were waiting for lenses they had ordered for the second pair .
negative	i asked to speak to the manager and complained .
negative	they are delivering the glasses for me but if i could i would have cancelled the transaction .
negative	it is one thing to have a problem but to blatantly lie about it destroys any trust .
negative	i will never deal with specsavers again .
negative	although it was known the item i ordered was not in stock and had to be ' shipped in ' i wasn_'_t informed of this .
negative	so much for next_day delivery !
negative	i only found out by telephoning with my query as to what had happened to my order .
negative	worst retailer i have ever come_across .
negative	ordered a tv because it was cheaper_than anywhere_else .
negative	big_mistake .
negative	has_been 0_weeks and it still_hasn_'_t arrived .
negative	i have called every week and got the same response " we will send you an email in the next few_days confirming your delivery date ".
negative	even worse , they dare to charge £_00 for " delivery " and told me that if i wanted to cancel and get a refund , the delivery charge would not be refunded !
negative	please everyone , save_yourself the hassle and get your tv from somewhere reputable , the tenner or so which you might save is simply not worth it .
negative	appalling fulfilment ruins this site and i potential_customers not to use it unless you want to wait weeks for your order to arrive and be fobbed_off endlessly by their ' customer service ' team telling you that " it will be there tomorrow ".
negative	they seem to show goods as available and then order them in to satisfy your order .
negative	then they blam ' supplier problems ' for the delay .
negative	i would have thought that if it '_s howing as available on their website then it '_s in stock but apparently not .
negative	seems to be run by a bunch of amateurs .
negative	placed order reference wa000000 on 00th_august_0000 for delivery on 00th_august_0000 .
negative	flowers were not delivered .
negative	this was for a birthday so very dissapointing
negative	i ordered the cross my heart - grandissimo flower_arrangement for my wife on our 00th_wedding_anniversary .
negative	the roses are bruised , battered and look to be well past their best on the day of delivery .
negative	very disappointed as they look like they were picked_up as the last available from a market_stall .
negative	i spent a lot of money on this arrangement and found that the quality of goods supplied is not acceptable .
negative	i also specified on the order that if we were not home when being delivered they should be left at rear of house .
negative	they were left on the front_door_step in full view of everyone using the public footpath and with no fence or gate to secure them .
negative	i have used serenata before and have been happy with their service .
negative	not again !
negative	have i been lucky before or is this a one - off problem ?
negative	they claim that they use 0 quality checks before dispatching the flowers .
negative	maybe everyone was on tea break when these were passed .
negative	they say that they are looking into the problem and will get back to me .
negative	have sent photos and it will be interesting to see their reply .
negative	not happy and will make_sure everyone_knows about it .
negative	placed orders in excess of £_0k , customer service needs_addressing , email response slow and abrupt .
negative	order partially dispatched no email to let_me know .
negative	continuously told certain items currently out of stock and will be delivered on a certain date , once date elapsed and no item received i had to approach them ... again told the item is currently out of stock for another month .
negative	stay_away unless you get confirmation on the phone that they have items available for immediate delivery .
negative	still_waiting on a refund , no reply email again to inform the refund will be paid back into account .
negative	i '_ve never_experienced a company like it .
negative	good luck with telephone_calls sounds_like half the guys have just got out of bed .
negative	ordered some trousers as they had free t - shirt offer .
negative	realised after ordering that i was supposed to choose a t - shirt and add before end .
negative	no problem i thought just reorder immediately with it added and cancel the other order .
negative	it was 00pm at night so emailed to cancel 0 minutes after order .
negative	within a few minutes email from the hut saying too late as order finalised .
negative	after a few emails asking not ti send , just got impersonal emails saying just return at your own_expense when it arrives .
negative	i did say if they sent me the free t - shirt separately all good .
negative	but same response ... send it back on receipt .
negative	this company needs to improve customer service asap .
negative	cost £ 0 to return on a £_00 spend .
negative	for your records , your original query was :
negative	i have an issue with with order number :_00000000
negative	order items :
negative	00000000 ,
negative	issue selected - i have a problem with my order
negative	issue details - there is an item missing from my order
negative	additional details - part or accessory missing from product
negative	customer added details :
negative	i have contacted you before about this order .
negative	i ordered due to free t - shirt and didn_'_t add at time of this order
negative	so ordered again 00000000
negative	i don_'_t mind having both orders if you could kindly send
negative	a t - shirt the same as i received in the above order .
negative	if this is not possible i will be returning order no
negative	00000000 .
negative	i hope you can assist me in this matter as it is very inconvenient
negative	otherwise .
negative	order roses for my girlfriend for our 0year and 0months while on tour when they got to her they were dieing
negative	very disapointed
negative	whilst paying for a flight for my dad to return to spain , this seemed to be the cheapest one way deal but turned_out to be anything but the cheapest .
negative	it let_me book his flight and had to pay a credit_card surcharge which is the norm for these types of companies .
negative	the problem was that he just wanted a cheap flight and did not care where he sat so did not want to pay extra to chose where to sit ( as you normally do with other_airlines ).
negative	we were able to book a flight and the money was deducted but then we found that booking a flight does not automatically allocate a seat and you have to actually pay more afterwards to sit_down .
negative	as you have no option but to pay for a seat , surely it should be impossible to book a flight without booking a seat .
negative	had we known that you have got to chose a seat and pay extra , we could have either looked elsewhere or paid for it at the time of the original booking .
negative	instead , because the reservation had already been paid for , a second payment had to be made for the cheapest seat and a second card surcharge was applied for the flight to be taken .
negative	therefore they ripped us off for £ 0 or so extra for the credit_card surcharge which is a fixed amount by allowing a flight to be booked seperately .
negative	if i know a company would use city - link to deliver my goods , i buy elsewhere .
negative	they are the only courier company whose driver does not understand that my drive gate slides to the side to open and i have seen it on my cctv_camera where the driver gets out , pushes and pulls violently on my gate and then goes back , writes a card and pushes it into a gap on my gate .
negative	luckily it was still just readable when i eventually looked out of the living_room window to spot the card .
negative	i had arranged to work from home as i had expected the delivery .
negative	then , trying to arrange for me to collect from their_offices was a complete_joke .
negative	i urgently_needed the parcel but no one wanted to answer the number that i eventually_managed to get for the leeds office where the parcel ended_up .
negative	when i got there , the service was appaling .
negative	i once found a very decomposed card in my garden amongst the leaves that collect in a corner which did not give any clue as to whether it was mine or had just been blown in by the wind .
negative	i found it was for something of mine and had i not found it that day , they would have returned it to the sender .
negative	i have had cards pushed through the letterbox when i have been in .
negative	i had even wedged the kitchen_door open in case they knocked quietly instead of ringing the door_bell .
negative	again , cctv showed the driver walk over to the door and walk_away seconds later so i have to assume that he had already written the card out before approaching the house as he only made one journey to the house and had no parcel with him when he did .
negative	before i installed cctv , i had to send proof of my signature to ebuyer because i had apparently signed for an item when i was 00 miles_away .
negative	obviously the signature was nothing like mine and i know no one else was at the house .
negative	funnily_enough , about 0 months later , i looked out of the rear patio_doors to find a scruffy yellow bag in the middle of the lawn .
negative	the delivery driver had been , left the parcel outside the rear patio_doors ( which we never used during the winter ) and it had been outside for 0 months .
negative	the neighbours cats had obviously been at it as it was all ripped and the contents ( a £_000 motherboard ) was lying at the side of it , very wet and mouldy .
negative	if he had left me a note telling_me to look around the back , i would have been slightly_annoyed but happy that i had my £_000 motherboard and i may not have realized that my signature had been forged .
negative	i think the guys at work feel the same as we have had over £ 0000 of goods left_outside the dispatch doors in the rain .
negative	luckily they were not pinched and were clingfilm wrapped but as we did not get there until just before 0am , they had been sat outside on their own for over an_hour .
negative	they consistently try to deliver before 0am even when we tell them we do not get there until just before 0 and are reluctant to do anything about this .
negative	all in all , i think i have had more problematic deliveries than successful ones from city - link .
negative	i had many happy years with tiscali and had some slight ups and downs but when talk_talk took over , i knew from relatives and friends experiences that thinks were not going to be as rosy .
negative	i had internet connectivity problems with most web_pages taking around 00 seconds to load .
negative	this was the same on all 0 pc '_s in my house and my mobile_phone over wifi .
negative	in fact , surfing the internet was faster on my mobile_phone when on the phone network or using a vodafone 0g dongle on the pc .
negative	i phoned their tech_support ( in mumbai ) who would not listen to me ( i am an ex - college lecturer in pc programming and maintenance and know a bit about how computers work ).
negative	they wanted me to change various settings on my pc , including disabling startup items in msconfig but then told me to ignore the message_telling_me to reboot as it was not necessary .
negative	this is when i finally decided they did not know what they were talking_about ( startup items get loaded at startup and configuring the pc to not load them and not rebooting is pointless because they have already loaded up ).
negative	they consistently blamed my wifi setup and told me wifi will always be very slow and could normally take up to 00 seconds to load a page over wifi .
negative	this is why i decided to change to plusnet ( great service ).
negative	i knew they would mess the billing up and try to bill me for service after i had changed provider so i emailed them to tell them i was cancelling the direct_debit and would make a final payment manually .
negative	as soon as the next bill was generated by their system , they cut my phone off as soon as they realized the direct_debit was cancelled .
negative	sure_enough they were trying to bill me in advance and also had the cheek to try to add an extra £_00 for the direct_debit being cancelled .
negative	i made a manual payment for what i had calculated to owe them and ignored all communication thereafter as i had changed to plusnet a couple of days_later .
negative	they no_longer persue me for money that i do not owe them .
negative	i use kay and co who use yodel for there deliverys ... my problems started 0_weeks_ago
negative	parcel 0 never turned_up and ended_up back at kay '_s 0_weeks_later , parcel 0 the same as parcel 0 both had no delivery attempts .

negative	been out for delivery since monday 00 st oct ( i '_m still_waiting ) i '_ve been on the phone 0 times with more promises of it will be out again tomorrow for delivery !!!!
negative	i '_m now fuming and in future will check when i buy from online company '_s which delivery company they use and if it '_s yodel i will not buy from them !!

negative	nightfreight didnt even turn_up to collect my parcel .
negative	i payed £_00 for a strimmer to get collected on friday between 0 and 0 , no collection made so i got in touch with parcel_monkey who said sorry andwould get intouch with them to arrange_collection on the monday ,,,, guess_what !
negative	they never came for it ..... i will go back to using myhermes as they never_let_me down dazmadden @_yahoo . co . uk
negative	i payed £_000 for 0 pouches of fags , payed by bank_transfer , 00 days_later nothing came , contacted tobacooking they said customs will have them , i rang customs and they said they havnt , tobacooking didnt want to know !!!
negative	they have no proof of postage or tracking , how do you know if they will post it !!
negative	ive complained to trading_standards , the internet crime bureau , and hm revenue and customs ......
negative	hope this helps , ive_used this site once and never again
negative	i ordered one of their bundles online and from the off , the service was rubbish .
negative	sent only part of the order despite telling_me i signed for it all !
negative	the bits they forgot to send were the actual camera and bag !
negative	phone every day for a week and was promised a call back each day .
negative	this never happened .
negative	finally spoke to a manager and was assured a call back but again never happened .
negative	asked for full_refund to which she said we will refund you in full .
negative	i checked what they were refunding and she said £_000 .
negative	i had paid £_000 !
negative	!
negative	the customer_services at this company is a total_joke and in a way i am_glad it all fell through as i found the package cheaper_elsewhere .
negative	avoid unless you enjoy hassle
negative	you must do it in time
negative	my 00 months with vodafone were excellent bar the issue with not putting insurance on my phone which was resolved within a couple of calls to them and receiving a call or 0 back to resolve the matter ; however my next 00 months have been littered with dissatisfaction and stress .
negative	the customer service has absolutely_terrible , i think i have made about 00 calls to them , each lasting more than 00_minutes at a time and only ever recieved 0 call_backs after being told each time i would get a call of a manager and on top of the calls about 00 e_- mails have been sent and the only responses i seem to get are generic ' we ' re sorry ' e_- mails , this all started when they gave_me incorrect information over the phone which resulted_in them not taking payment from my account and charging me a fee , not all i asked was for them to pay half the fee and i '_ll pay the other half .... that was 0 months_ago :( very unhappy and stressed out !!!!
negative	for a communications company with hundreds of staff , i '_m_sure there is at_least 0 person that i corresponded with that could have helped_me out !!!!
negative	not happy in the slightest !!
negative	!
negative	0 out of 00 as this site and electrixworld . com are not trading !
negative	fraudulent
negative	i am still_awaiting delivery of 0 x_000ml blue grass perfume and this was supposedly consigned almost two_weeks_ago .
negative	either delayed in postal_system or lost , i do not know but what i do know this has_been charged to my visa account , and i have already paid for same .
negative	limit your money over anything .. so they can earn interest on it .. avoid
negative	very disappointed by the service .
negative	when it was clearly_shown online as " in stock " i expected to receive the item .
negative	i was told they were unable to get it from the supplier and therefore could not supply .
negative	i was not even offered an_alternative either .
negative	do not trust " in stock " when shown
negative	really bad customer service , store manager rude and not helpful ...
negative	so this is the question you sent me ... " thanks a squillion for shopping with very recently !
negative	now we wanna know what you think so we can keep making shopping with us even more brilliant .
negative	and remember , honesty '_s the best policy so tell us the truth , the whole truth and nothing but the truth about shopping with us , what your stuff was like and our customer service ."
negative	***
negative	what can i say ... after bluffing me for nearly 0_weeks ( via phone and email ) that my order was on the way , it was inexplicably cancelled .
negative	no apology , no nothing until after i complained !
negative	apparently this is common with very nowadays and i wish i had researched before - i used to a be littlewoods ( as they used to be called ) customer many_years_ago , no_problems then ...
negative	i won_'_t give very the benefit of the doubt !
negative	placed my order on thursday 0rd and it is now monday the 0th . phoned customer service this morning only for the completely_clueless lady on the end of the phone to inform_me that my order got held up in the system or some sort of woffle !!
negative	told me she would push it through today and would receive a dispatch email .
negative	still no dispatch email at 0 :_00pm so phoned again only for another person to tell me it wont be dispatched until tomorrow .
negative	so adding 0 more days on to that will make it a full week since i placed my order !!
negative	but thats not the best bit . bulk_powders are now running a free delivery promotion . so yes you guessed it ..... still paying for delivery . shocking !
negative	i ordered online from justoffbase and although the website shows stock they did not have any and no planned stock so they refunded my money .
negative	they need to work out their stock_levels and list it live on the website to avoid further inconvenience to customers .
negative	i placed the order online with a 00 - 00 day delivery on 0th_september and on chasing the order today , which is the 00th_september i am told the sent me an e_- mail on the 0th_september advising that delivery would be 0 - 0_weeks and because they never_heard back they never did anything with the order .
negative	on checking the email address they sent it to an e_- mail address that does not exist .
negative	would you not phone the client if you never received a response .... very poor !!
negative	!
negative	i ordered a cctv monitor .
negative	they wanted to send me there in - house item .
negative	i told them i wanted the item i ordered .
negative	the in - house item arrived with the tamper seals broken and missing accessories .
negative	i called numerous_times but no returned phone_calls etc .
negative	i eventually got an email_explaining that i may have hot the demo item by mistake .
negative	after more phone_calls emails i was told that i must have caused the damage to the item received and a full_refund was unlikely as they had the demo item at there warehouse , so i must be lying about the item i received .
negative	i went to my card company to chase the refund on my behalf .
negative	i think if you ordered a video player , they would send you a cd_player , as they probably look the same and then wonder what your problem was .
negative	update_: i have just read the response to my review from tech000 .
negative	just to confirm my credit_card company chased the refund on my behalf .
negative	my order with tech 000 was cancelled .
negative	i ordered what i originally required with a proper and honest company .
negative	i guess the truth hurts .
negative	the tech 000 response is a lie do not trust this outfit .
negative	also if tech 000 or ben feel that my comments are in anyway slanderous or incorrect i would be more than happy for them to persure myself to seek redress for the facts .
negative	sell tickets but aint willing to issue refunds even_though we wasent allowed access into the venue due to not being members of the club !
negative	which was on stated in the ticket description .
negative	purchased a number of items last_year , 0 items not delivered .
negative	contacted ballicom numerous_times about it over last month or 0 via_email and through their website , have been completely_ignored .
negative	only option is small_claims court it seems .
negative	avoid .
negative	i was / am a business customer with talk_talk .
negative	probably the worst experience i have ever had .
negative	they are happy to trick you into any contract .
negative	its obvious that they are only interested in making money for their shareholders and have no morales .
negative	their staff all worship the ground talk_talk walk on and their communication with bt open_reach is awful .
negative	do not use talk_talk - they are scum .
negative	i ordered an office , they took my money quickly and gave_me a date of 00th_october to have room ready for their fitter .
negative	last_week they phoned to say their fitter paul would be with us on monday 00th and make_sure room is completely cleared .
negative	0000hrs monday no sign of fitter or furniture , rang customer_services who rang paul and informed me that paul had not been told of my job and that there had been a communications breakdown and they would look into it .
negative	0000 no call from customer_services so rang them again still no resolution .
negative	also tweeted @ richard hammonds and no reply from him either !
negative	late_afternoon and we now have a fitting date of tomorrow and wednesday but it took a lot of explaining the hassle that we had clearing a room into the rest of the house and taking 0 days leave to be here when they decided to come originally and failed .
negative	we wait but any joy has now gone as can we really trust them to do a good job ?
negative	well after 0 days fitting my 0 day job they have left site with a string of issues still to be sorted_out some small but some completely_unacceptable .
negative	the printer cupboard should have 0 sliding shelves as stated on their design diagram , it has none .
negative	there are 0 cable hole covers missing , they have made an access hole in one unit to allow access to a power_socket and have cut it with wavy sides just like an diy person might do , there is most of a large bar_code label still stuck onto the front of a cupboard , one screw has_been screwed in and split the veneer .
negative	there are other issues other than these and the whole_experience has turned from a joyous expectation to a depressing experience and both of us feel very down and not only that but we still cannot get our house back in order because we are now waiting for a solution , the company promised to get back to us today and fix a date for resolution work , surprise_surprise no call by 0000hrs .
negative	during friday we received an_apology for not getting back on thursday and told that a senior technician would be with us between noon and 0pm this thursday to finish installation and rectify issues .
negative	the senior technician arrived on the day stated and rectified approximately_half of the 00 + issues leaving us now waiting for the french_polisher to be appointed to maybe finish the job fully .
negative	initial date when i contacted customer_services to ask how much longer we were expected to live with 0 of our 0 bedrooms and living_room full up with items from the office area , not unreasonable as so_far our 0 day job has taken 0_weeks and living in this mess is very depressing especially when you read their brochure about their craftsmen taking pride in their work etc .
negative	we feel that so_far we have paid more than enough for their below diy skilled installation !
negative	we were initially given a date of next friday for the french_polisher but after explaining once again our displeasure of living in a mess for so long already they promised to look into the diary closer , now we have got an appointment for this monday .
negative	do these_people realise how depressing living like this is ?
negative	given that the issues quoted their expertise in their furniture should have made them realise that a french_polisher would be required , so why was one not booked to come with the senior technician ?
negative	once again ( 0rd time so_far ) we have had to delay the flooring fitters , i suspect that they are starting to get fed_up with rearranging their day due to hammond '_s inabilities to complete their work .
negative	monday 00th , 0_weeks into the 0 day fit and french_polisher arrives and spends a lot of time and effort trying to fix things but despite his_efforts we are still left with a door that due to it being squashed somewhen has a very noticeable damaged area and a dented cornice that any professional fitter would not have fitted in the first place so still trying to get a resolution .
negative	sent photos to their resolution team and have as yet not heard_anything other than standard we have received your message reply .
negative	wednesday 00th demand for final payment has arrived in post obviously this is being ignored until we are fully happy with the office .
negative	thursday 00th_november_0000 , 0nd french_polisher has_been and carried_out a repair to our new furniture , still have a panel that they owe us to come .
negative	is repaired new as good as perfect new and worth as much is the big question and will the repairs last ?
negative	my lawyer friend drafted a letter for me giving them until 0st december before we place a claim in a london small_claims court for breach of contract , we sent it recorded delivery but " surprisingly " they could not find the letter so had to send proof of delivery plus a copy of the documentation via_email to them as well .
negative	00th_november received text saying panel will be delivered tomorrow between 0000 and 0000hrs - do they assume we are just sitting at home waiting at their beck and call ?
negative	phoned to give times that we would be in and enquire as to how much there was outstanding to pay , as i wished to settle the final account on delivery of the panel and for some reason they were unable to tell me a figure but said that i would receive a letter with the details in and to wait_until that arrived .
negative	00th_november panel has arrived at last .
negative	awaiting decision on any compensation that they are willing to allow for the stress , inconvenience , especially arranging to be in when they wanted to turn_up , and refurbished furniture , we should have insisted all damaged parts were replaced and if the door did not match then they would have had to replace all 0 doors !
negative	crap useless customer_services take your money no goods turn_up because they use a crap company like royal_mail who always loses your parcel somehow , why use them i will never know , then you have to wait weeks before you can get a refund or sent a reorder absolutely a joke .
negative	placed an order , recieved ab email to say the order was dispatched .
negative	waited over a week , no order , got_intouch with monstersuppliments only to find that the order hadnt even left the warehouse .
negative	unacceptable
negative	some years_ago i bought a laptop from dell .
negative	my kitten peed on the keyboard .
negative	dell refused to repair it saying that it was biologically contaminated .
negative	i have made it a point never to buy from them again .
negative	my new sony z series laptop is one whizz of a computer , thoroughly_recommended .
negative	i sent my phone off htc_sensation xe & got paid for an htc_sensation .
negative	they are to completely_different phones yet i got paid for the lesser expensive model .
negative	i got htc to email regenesis with the phone details & still i only got paid the lesser amount this is not acceptable
negative	firstly can i say please don_'_t place a review before you have received your goods - all positive_reviews i have read are from customers who have only just placed their orders reviewing the buying stage alone , and not yet given wae_+ a chance to deliver ( or not ).
negative	i ordered a wireless_router in the middle of may showing as in stock .
negative	delivery was long at 0 - 0 days but i wasn_'_t in a rush so ordered it anyway .
negative	no communication from wae_+ at all , and no delivery .
negative	i contacted them numerous_times to be told to wait a few more days each time .
negative	still no delivery by 00th_june so i cancelled the order .
negative	since then i have been chasing for a refund and still not received one almost three_months since placing the order .
negative	these_cowboys should be shut_down immediately , from what i can read online i '_m certainly not alone with problems with wae_+.
negative	items are shown as in stock when they are not and unlikely to be at all from what i gather .
negative	they have no respect for any customers .
negative	i '_m having to claim back the money through my credit_card , and have also reported wae_+ to watchdog and trading_standards .
negative	absolutely dreadful .
negative	ordered my new guitar , paid for next_day delivery .
negative	i had to phone_call them the next_day asking about the order because i received no email to confirm my order .
negative	i accepted the fact that they could not deliver next_day anymore ( order was placed shortly_after 0pm ).
negative	then the next_day , no email confirmation for when the courier was picking the item from the depot .
negative	at the end of the day i had to email them and inquire_about the order .
negative	it has_been sent to the wrong depot therefore i had to wait another day to get my guitar .
negative	in their email they wrote that they ' upgraded ' me to the next_day delivery .
negative	it was not my fault and they were supposed to support the entire cost of delivery for this mistake .
negative	their replies were always very short and cold .
negative	nothing was offered in exchange for this .
negative	a friend recommended them but i sure will never ever recommend them based on the way they dealt_with this order .
negative	they need to have systems in place to guarantee that they deliver what they promise .
negative	really poor service with blantent lying .
negative	a missed delivery card on 0th_dec , that '_s fine and welcomed .
negative	i logon to the website and arrange to collect the package on sat 00th_dec from the depot .
negative	on the 00th , a hand_written sign is placed outside the depot sayin " no collections today ", if you walked up to the depot the manager of the depot would try to put you off by saying there is a 0 hour wait , looking at the queue of 00 people and the number that walked_away his detering tactics were working .
negative	eventually yodel checked to see if my package was in the depot , but only after i asked them to .
negative	their system said the package was signed for and delivered on the 0th_dec . against my instructions and with no card left in my letterbox telling_me where the package was .
negative	i queried this and theey asked thee delivery driver .
negative	he said it was left with the concierge , we don_'_t have a concierge !
negative	!
negative	yodel said they could do nothing as the parcel was a " successful delivery ", so anywhere_near is a success , no wonder they claim 00 - 00_% delivery rate , they just make up a different definition to the rest of the world what is a successful delivery .
negative	i should play that game where i work !
negative	as a side , i am an investment analyst and noticing the state of the new cross office , the poor condition of the phones , no letters on the keyboard , the old monitors and the general disrepair of the depot , this branch is being run into the ground .
negative	it is little wonder_why yodel is receiving such poor customer feedback if this is the lack of investment the head_office has made across the group .
negative	i cancelled my second order from the supplier and placed my custom elsewhere .
negative	to all suppliers whi use yodel .
negative	do not as it will be your customers that suffer and you will lose customers .
negative	sometimes cheap is not better , this is one of those cases .
negative	a complete wast of time
negative	ordered 0th_july , recieved email dispached same day [ very good ] now 0th still no delivery , phoned viovet , told i should have recieved them by now but would have to wait 00 days before they would re deliver free of charg &, can i get an interim supply from the vet . will see if they arrive tomorrow , will i order from viovet again , i do not think so .
negative	i purchased one key and passed the anti_fraud_checks and was emailed stating all further orders would be instant with no further checks , i purchased the same key again for my brother and was again sent an auto email requesting for anti_fraud_checks , of which i replied but unlike the first key i have not yet recieved the 0nd , this is poor as i was told further orders would have no issues , the payment was succesful but i recieved no key , i tried to contact support via skype , facebook , twitter and email , but with no replies , i am not happy with this service .
negative	i will update my review if an adequate explanation is given and the issue is resolved promptly , if it isnt then i would suggest taking your custom elsewhere
negative	britain uses three point mains plugs lamp delivered with continental two pin_plug not
negative	very good .
negative	bought a computer from these and it developed a fault after 0_weeks .
negative	two_weeks on and multiple emails no response for the warranty claim i need to raise .
negative	fast to take my money and horrible non_existent cs
negative	i placed an order early november for delivery on 00th and it was delivered on time .
negative	i placed another order early december for delivery on 00st which was not delivered until 00th !
negative	neither i nor the intended_recipient had any communication during that time .
negative	i emailed on 00th and 00th to try to find out what had happened and request a refund .
negative	email reply on 0rd janu said they were ' happy to inform_me that my order had been delivered , gave no date , just a weblink to the delivery company '_s site .
negative	this link gave the date of 00th_dec . on the company '_s own website , delivery details were still pending for both the nov and dec orders as late as this 0th_jan .
negative	i am still_waiting for an_apology and a refund .
negative	i am applying for a visa_chargeback to recover the cost .
negative	although i was happy with iflorist for earler orders / deliveries , this latest experience has put me right off them .
negative	absolutely awful !
negative	ordered glasses seemingly successfully only to be told a couple of days_later that the frames were discontinued .
negative	so i contact customer_services and select another frame .
negative	another two_days pass and guess_what .
negative	those frames are also discontinued .
negative	i then gave up , got my money back and went elsewhere .
negative	go to spex0less . com .
negative	ordered from them on the monday_night and received my glasses on the thursday_morning .
negative	website is simple enough and can '_t complain with the prices , but the service is rubish , its ment to be instant delivery ( email code ) but i had to wait around 0 days , i actualy cancelled my oder because the service was so bad , i won_'_t use this site again and have told all my friends to not use it either .
negative	after an_hour wait and two phone_calls later , they finally arrived .
negative	certainly didn_'_t need that after 00 hour flight .
negative	also when we made the call , they kept asking what time the flight arrived and what time we came out .
negative	seriously , there are tv monitors at the airport displaying arrival times and as for when we came out , that is besides the point - they should have been there waiting .
negative	never again .
negative	when you have ordered xl latex trunks to find out they are only waist 00_inch and you can '_t return then is very poor .
negative	xl does not in my opinion = 00_inch waist this is to small xl should mean 00 in waist .
negative	honour you need to be more realistic in your garment sizing .
negative	you have lost a customer .
negative	i could cut costs and run this company better if i was company director
negative	what an embarrassing low quality service .
negative	smashed screens were insured , but refused to compensate saying items not packed properly , had to sue them via court before they paid up before meeting the judge .
negative	hundreds of unnecessary numbers for diff departments and they cant seem to put you through .
negative	terrible pricing data spread over unintelligible sheets with unusual formatting , same with ridiculous invoices .
negative	just a bad bad_experience , and i have used them regularly for a good few_years to know this .
negative	i '_m off after yet another failed collection .
negative	why take the order if you feel you cannot deliver ?
negative	i have had this problem twice with them .
negative	i place the order and they dont have the item in stock so they will source it for you .
negative	i was willing to wait , 0 week , then two_weeks .. was told it will arrive by a certain date when i queried .
negative	still , no delivery but the usual update message " will be slightly_delayed with shipment till ..."
negative	in 0000 it is unacceptable for a company in the channel to take money off a customer promise delivery and miss that schedule by 0_weeks .
negative	surely you could have sourced that item in 0_weeks ?
negative	oh_yes they could have , but they dont care to because clearly im not a priority .
negative	or they cant source it below the price they offered it to me at .
negative	will not use them again .
negative	they had their chance .
negative	they should never have taken my money or promised to supply it .
negative	so we get their guy out to visit for an easy sale as mum needed blinds for her new apartment , and we were recommended the firm by the new building manager .. ( bad mistake ).
negative	he comes in to measure up and price .. they then called me to take deposit and so we thought things were rolling .
negative	0_weeks passes by , nothing .
negative	another week passes by and nothing .. so i call to investigate and was advised that actually the blinds have not been ordered .
negative	so i ask them why , only to be told that the person_who came out wasnt the right person to take the measurements ?
negative	apparently he was only there to give a rough_estimate and that the proper measurements will need to be taken ?
negative	incredulous at the incompetence and lack of willingness to be orderly i had to insist on cancelling the order and that my payment be returned immediately .
negative	im speechless at such incompetence after they took a hefty_deposit and " ran " ater taking my money .
negative	i had to call to understand the items were not in stock !!
negative	that they were to be delivered next week , from 0rd_party who " had them in stock " but with no guarantee they wouldbe despatched today !
negative	utter madness , purchase cancelled never again wasted 0 week for system upgrade .
negative	ordered an item on the 00th_december , the website stated that the item was on a pre oi rder status apart_from a few remaining in the size i required .
negative	as this was to be a gift for the end of the month i decided to order from spoiled brat rather_than the manufacturer ( the manufacturer had free delivery and a 00_%_off first order ) as i did not want to wait_until the 0rd_january which was the date given if i bought direct .
negative	i received no dispatch information so wrote to spoiled brat to query the delay .
negative	they advised that they would not be dispatching this until the 0rd_january , the same date as the manufacturer .
negative	the email received from customer_services seems to imply that the fault was somehow mine for not reading the product description .
negative	the item concerned is still showing as in stock despite my complaint and the response to my complaint on the length of time it has taken for customer service to address my concerns was " as you are aware our offices were closed from friday the 00st of december for christmas and reopened today , this is the reason your emails were no responded to earlier " how i was supposed to have known that they decided to close the office 0 days before_christmas , this was not mentioned in any correspondence to me .
negative	i have written again to ask them to review the way this has_been dealt_with and am awaiting hopefully a more reasonable response to the error .
negative	0th_jan , as yet i have still not received any response to my complaint .
negative	i did however receive an email on the 0rd of january to state that my order had been dispatched .
negative	this was followed_by an email on the 0th_january stating that an error had been made and the order had not been dispatched and was now again out of stock .
negative	the customer service department is unhelpful , inept and incompetent and i would not recommend this company to anyone .
negative	i would suggest that if you want a particular item from this store , bypass them and go direct to the manufacturer or use a different stockist to avoid stress and disappointment .
negative	if i could i would give this site a minus star_rating .
negative	0th_jan - i see spoiled brat have managed to respond to this review but have negated to accept their error .
negative	i am unsure if my comment shows as a response so have posted here too .
negative	wow , what a response .
negative	i suggest you check your emails before you come on this site and declare that no error has_been made .
negative	yes an error has_been made and in case you did not understand i will clarify the situation once again .
negative	yes this item was available on a pre order status apart_from 0 in stock in a size large and this is what i ordered .
negative	i never once requested this for a christmas delivery in fact my email quite clearly_states that it was a gift for the end of the month .
negative	your emails also quite clearly_state that you were closed from the 00st until the 00th .
negative	you have also failed to address the fact that the you emailed me the article had been dispatched on the 0rd of january and then a follow_up email on the 0th to say an error had been made and it had not been sent and was again out of stock .
negative	i am quite happy to copy and paste all emails sent and received on this site , including a screen print that clearly_shows said item was in stock .
negative	i am amazed that you somehow found the time to respond to this review but as yet had not had time to email me directly with a response to my complaint .
negative	i stand by my initial review and will have no_hesitation in taking this matter further .
negative	futher to the 0nd response from this company , i would ask any other poster to read my review here or my emails and point out any rude or aggressive language .
negative	yet again they have swiftly side stepped the issue and tried to revert the blame on the customer .
negative	i have made no threats other than to state if they made any further libellous comments against me on this site that i would take legal_advice and i will also ask for your response to be amended .
negative	i resent the accusation that i have been rude , abusive and have threatened you .
negative	i have posted a fair an accurate review and you have not answered my complaint apart_from to post untruths .
negative	had orders for 0 cartridges .... they gave_me 0 !!!
negative	two color and 0 b / w ... all 0 b / w cartridges turned_out to be empty !!!
negative	... just using the color cartridges now !!
negative	!
negative	hi friend , i shall be only too pleased to review the product if it ever arrives , despite trying to contact the company , i have received no reply .
negative	gloxy uk have a huge issue with how they deal with customer issues .
negative	we have tried to get the same message to them 0 times and they send the same generic response every time .
negative	they say that their products have a 0 year_warranty but try and claim on it - best if luck .
negative	we are having major issues with these_guys .
negative	their products keep getting high ratings on reviews but when things go_wrong , they cannot deal with it .
negative	terrible .
negative	having ordered a gloxy flash for >£ 000 , i expected it to give years of trouble_free service .
negative	the flash isn_'_t a year_old and it has failed , now this in it self isn_'_t a great problem as all of the products on the digital toy shop website have at_least a 0 year_warranty .
negative	when we contacted them , with their order number from their website , we were told that we had placed the order direct with gloxy ( never been on the gloxy website !
negative	).
negative	customer service - non_existent .
negative	i ordered a nikon_d0000 body only from value basket online on 00 / 00 /_0000 , and waited for delivery .
negative	i check my online profile to keep_up to date with the delivery and the status remained the same for days and days .
negative	eventually , i contacted them via_email and they said there was a delay in getting stock and my order would be fulfilled when stock was available .
negative	when this happened i looked at reviews of this company online and regretted sending them almost £_000 .
negative	i asked for a refund and was told that it would take 0 days to process and then my bank would take 0 - 0 days to credit my account ( rubbish ).
negative	i emailed again after 0 days to find out what was happening and i got another email_stating that my refund was being_processed and it would be 00 days till i got a refund .
negative	i have emailed them since , informing them that i will be pursuing this matter through the small_claims court .
negative	my advice - the price they put online is too good to be true .
negative	they have terrible customer service and if you do a quick google_search you will find out that the goods are shipped into the uk as " gifts " and no import_tax is paid .
negative	if hmrc open the package and find out you have paid for this item , then you will be responsible for paying the import_duty etc , which makes it no cheaper_than a high_street shop ( without_any guarantees etc ).
negative	i am still_waiting for my refund .
negative	i am sure i can change this once i recieve a payment from fonebank , there seems to be some sort of issue with the payment coming to me in chjeque , maybe i should have given my banking details instead as two_weeks on i still have nothing ...
negative	after ordering an item 0 days ago , i still have not recieved my item , delivery was supposed to be 0 - 0 days , if it comes tomorrow it will be 0 days .
negative	im not holding my breath !!
negative	once ( if ) i recieve my item i will not be using this website again .
negative	i haven_'_t had the certificate yet from my asbestos course tried_emailing you but no response so not great service still need it
negative	have been having a on going battle with vodafone about signal issues and to cut a long_story_short they sent me out a new ( reconditioned ) phone that arrives in a plastic_bag and they take the old one away in a plastic_bag .
negative	well that one lasted 0_weeks before it packed us so off it went again .
negative	chucked in to the plastic_bag then chucked in to the back of a courier van .
negative	about 0_weeks_later i have just received a bill for £_000 for screen damage .
negative	?
negative	the screen didn_'_t have a scratch on it when it left my hand and went in the plastic_bag .
negative	so after about 0 hours on the phone and 0 emails i have been told that it '_s not there problem .
negative	if i have an issue i should take it up with there courier they don_'_t want to know and have said they want there £_000 .
negative	i feel that this is a disgusting service , i have been with them for 00 years and will have payed them in the region of £_00 , 000 + with my phone and employes .
negative	and this is how they treat you .
negative	well vodafone i would like to say that me and all my employees will now be getting orange phones so say good buy to your £_000 per_month .
negative	morons .
negative	* ordered blinds at 0 . 00 on thursday .
negative	* paid an additional £ 0 . 00 for next_day fast track delivery as we had a project to
negative	complete that weekend .
negative	* received a order confirmation_email .
negative	all down_hill after this ..........
negative	* no delivery arrived
negative	* no email
negative	* no despatch email
negative	* no call
negative	* no courier contact
negative	* nothing !
negative	* i telephoned them late_afternoon on their 0000 number ( presumably expensive , but the cost isn_'_t show on their website and they don_'_t offer a " local " rate or 0000 free rate call ).
negative	their call system put me in a queue for 0mins and then dumped my call into a " leave a message " voice_mail with a uninterested grumpy male voice .
negative	( don_'_t you just hate it when companies can '_t be_bothered and don_'_t care enough to answer their customers calls !).
negative	needles to say i '_ve left several messages , and they haven_'_t called me back , or contacted me in any way .
negative	* no response to web " contact us " enquires .
negative	* they are shut at weekends .
negative	so , i have no blinds and not a blind idea what '_s going on !
negative	their web_site is good and easy to order from .
negative	i could be cynical about the fact that they have put a lot of effort into creating a great website to take your money , but no apparent effort into doing anything after that point .
negative	massively disappointing
negative	ps .
negative	i '_ve since found a freephone 0000 0000000 number and a normal geographic_number 00000_000000 to use when contacting them .
negative	these numbers are not shown on their website but do work and connect to 000blinds .
negative	it still doesn_'_t mean they are going to answer the phone though !!!
negative	!
negative	chemaist direct use a courier company who only deliver during the day & need a signature .
negative	their depot is 00 miles_away from me , which would be a 00 miles round_trip if i was daft enough to go and collect .
negative	why they use the normal mail where i can collect from my post_office which is 000_yards_away .
negative	even if the service cost a little more i ' d be prepared to pay , because the courier company is useless if youre out working during the day like most people !
negative	what plonkers chemist_direct are for using a business courier to deliver to domestic customers .
negative	they clearly don_'_t understand their customers
negative	i won_'_t be buying again from them
negative	in february we applied for a mortgage fom woolwich , brand of barclays .
negative	it was agreed in principle – then suddenly declined .
negative	apart_from the grounds being spurious , they took a £_000 " withdrawal fee ", even_though we certainly did not withdraw .
negative	bordering on fraud , yet it took repeated demands to get that refunded .
negative	the mortgage lot didn_'_t even bother contacting me .
negative	my demands for an additional payment ( to charity ) for all the distress and time lost have been ignored .
negative	my strong impression is that they regard customers with contempt .
negative	there will be consequences , including this review and closing our barclays premium account .
negative	having purchased many , many superdry tshirts on their web_site and washed all shirts safely at 00c without_any problem with running dyes ( of which all superdry t shirts comprise a lot if , i was upset and angry when my latest t shirt ended_up tye died and ruined after just one wash expecting a polite and helpful response to my request for a refund on return of the ruined item , i was told several_times it was my fault for not washing on a cold wash , even_though 00 odd superdry tshirts in my possession had never ran at my normal cool 00 c wash - their emails eventually threatened me with fraud if i persisted in asking for a refund via a chargeback on my credit_card which i feel is warranted under the sale of goods_act as it was not of merchantable quality if the dye ran so easily out of the t shirt and it was turned from white to patchy tye die blue after one wash . i was not expecting such a threatening and hostile response to what i feel is a genuine complaint on my part , having spent_hundreds of pounds on my t shirts from their web_site
negative	here is a copy of their response threatening me as a fraudster
negative	by filing a chargeback in this situation you will be committing fraud and this email thread will be used in our appeal to that chargeback .
negative	the bank will likely use it afterwards to pursue the fraudulent claim .
negative	so nice to think i have been relegated to the realms of a fraudster - what a nice way of speaking to a customer with a genuine complaint
negative	i work for a big national company andi would never be allowed to speak to a customerlike that in an email and even on the basis of goodwill alone would have refunded the money to keep a longstanding_customer happy
negative	i will be filing a chargeback for this faulty tshirt and will not be giving any more of my money to a company who has such a bad customer service response , and poor aftercare service
negative	miss j lockley
negative	after making a purchase with these ( simply_electronics ) i decided to cancel the order , this is where the fun started .
negative	i checked my order status which was still ' allocating stock ', i filled in the cancellation form on the web_page and sent it , i received an email back with the header ' i want to cancel my order ' but the contents was telling_me that my order was delayed in being despatched .
negative	i sent another email to confirm the cancellation which the reply was the same .
negative	another email was sent and i got the reply that they might not be able to cancel the order as it was being readied for despatch .
negative	the same emails went back and forth for a few_days and then i got an email_saying it had been despatched anyway just in case i changed my mind when it was on the way .... why would i change my mind when i ' d been trying to cancel it !!!
negative	so i had to refuse the order when it turned_up and then wait for it to be returned back to them so i can get a refund ..... still_waiting .... do not use these !!!
negative	!
negative	0_weeks_later .... still no refund , had excuses as to why so i have now contacted my card_issuer to claim the money back through them
negative	ordered an expensive tent and matching footprint .
negative	checked the status of the order to find ' awaiting id '.
negative	would have been helpful to know this was required whilst ordering .
negative	when i phoned customer service was told the order had been cancelled , as id had not been submitted .
negative	therefore , i asked if i could order again , were the items in stock ?
negative	the reply was no .
negative	none in stock .
negative	as the delivery stated 0 - 0 days , i was not happy about this , as the tent was still advertised on the website .
negative	i needed the tent quite quickly , therefore ordered elsewhere .
negative	would not use this company again .
negative	i had purchased a air_hockey table online and they phoned me back telling_me that they did not have any instock and a refund would take 0 working_days , i explained that i could not wait that long as i need the money to buy a replacement , the sales_person showed no interest , i asked to speak to the director / manager who apparently was not availible but the sales_person would get them to call me to sort_out a same day transfer , this has not happened and the refund is still not processed .
negative	they took payment of £_000 then when i turned_up at faulty towers the owner demanded £_000 before i gave the keys ....
negative	very dodgy
negative	who builds a company like this ...... i give them 0 months max before we start seeing yellow vans again !
negative	bought a 0 off unique expensive item from ebay choose yodel ...
negative	package delivers to a student house ... no note put in my door .... package gets pee ' d on .... yodel customer_services say .... contact your supplier and get them to send another one .
negative	remembering this is unique they say .... we can send a £_00 compensation !
negative	i felt_like yodelling someone !
negative	i was promised £_00 . 00 for my phone and ended_up with £ 0 . 00 , please avoid do not use this company .
negative	very bad_experience .
negative	this is a review of my experience of ' optical_express customer service ' relating to the refund of a deposit for laser_eye_surgery .
negative	i had lasik eye_surgery over 0 months_ago .
negative	on the day of my first aftercare appointment my wife accompanied me and was tested to see if she was suitable for the same procedure i had had .
negative	she was , and so the clinician pressurised us into making the holding_deposit payment of £_000 and booking the procedure then and there .
negative	my main_concern at that point was that if i started having side - effects in the following two months leading up to her surgery , would we still be able to cancel and get this money back ?
negative	the clinician advised us that ' yes this would get paid back up to 00hrs before the surgery '.
negative	so we made the payment and were handed a simple payment receipt .
negative	as we left the branch we were given a patient pack , containing all the relevant_documentation and t &_c '_s , but were advised ' don_'_t worry_about reading this now , your wife will need to have a look through it closer to the time of the surgery and come with it signed or ask the surgeon any questions that she may have '.
negative	since then i have suffered many acute side - effects including severe dry - eye ( waking me up 0 - 0 times a night with my eye - lids fused together ), ghosting & glare ( making me unable to drive at night ) pain in my eyes , and hugely variable clarity of vision that has meant i have been off work .
negative	in fairness oe have been attempting to assist me throughout this with my aftercare regimen , and i am still hopeful that my eyesight will settle_down ( even_though i am upset and angry that the true likelihoods of various side - effects were not fully_explained to me prior to having the procedure ).
negative	clearly , having faced these side - effects we decided that it was not wise for my wife to go_ahead with the same procedure .
negative	however , we were informed by optical_express that the deposit made is non - refundable and that they only return the money if cancellations are received within_00hrs of booking .
negative	for the last 0 months i have written letters , had hugely frustrated phone - calls and am now at my wit '_s end .
negative	i still keep getting the company line from their staff , ' due to our terms and conditions this deposit is non - refundable '.
negative	these are the same t &_c '_s that were directly contradicted by the advice given to us in the branch at the point - of - sale ; the same t &_c '_s that were handed to us after payment was made and the same t &_c '_s that we were told not to worry_about reading straight_away ( despite the fact that there was a severely limited time - dependant clause on the payment of refunds ).
negative	so my advice is simple .
negative	do your research on the procedure itself and ask yourself the question are you willing to take the risks .
negative	then , and only then , with 000_% certainty should you book a procedure and pay the deposit , as once it '_s paid , you will never see it again .
negative	they don_'_t care at all , as a seller you have virtually no protection from scams , even if a buyer has a problem with an item mot of the time the seller loses out even_though its not their fault .
negative	lots of hidden_fees , 00_% final value 00p here 00p there paypal .
negative	at_least on other platforms they tell you the fees upfront .
negative	avoid
negative	in store is generally ok . online are useless , loose items send unsigned cheques and take 0_weeks to process orders
negative	i recently used hermes after giving up on them for some years for shockingly rubbish service , it took 0 days ( not including them picking it up on the saturday ) for them to deliver a pc tower which they also managed to dent in the process .
negative	the side of this pc tower is 0mm steel so god_knows_how badly it must have been looked after for them to " achieve " that .
negative	luckily the buyer was happy enough to live with it as the side wasn_'_t in view .
negative	this tower was fortunately of lowish value but was packaged exactly the same as it was when dhl delivered it to me a year previous and clearly_shows from the box what is inside .
negative	from that alone anyone with any education would be able to deduce was something not to be playing rugby with .
negative	anyway moving on , as a buyer i recently ordered a football_shirt from liverpool . tv and whilst delivery times were good i was at home on the day of delivery and while waiting for a knock ( i just happened to see him turn_up ) i was able to stand and watch when , instead of knocking so i could answer and take half the time it took him to post it , he proceeded to ram it through .
negative	i could have been on the loo , wiped and got to the door in the space of time it took him to try and ruin my purchase so no idea how he expected it to save time .
negative	in any case , you could argue me plowing through crowds of pedestrians would save time driving through town it doesn_'_t make it the right way to do it .
negative	this badly_creased the reciept as well as the item , when i say badly if i ' d made an effort to do it badly i wouldn_'_t have been able to match his expertise .
negative	this wouldn_'_t have been so bad but the receipts from the website i ordered from are collectable as they carry a pleasant view of a stand at anfield .
negative	he also stood a very real risk of ripping the shirt at the same time which i '_m surprised about as the average letter - box isn_'_t exactly smooth inside ....
negative	this was from one of their franchise delivery personal who turned_up in a rough looking people carrier and had no form of uniform , clearly he doesn_'_t take care of the items in his possession and as the same man who picked_up the pc tower i wouldn_'_t be surprised if he was the one who dented the case .
negative	still , looking at other reviews , at_least it wasn_'_t left inside a bin or with thieves in the neighbourhood .
negative	where do i start ?
negative	well , my gf and i were looking into buying a car with cash but decided to take a look at stebbings with a view to finance on a car .
negative	the first day we tried to view a car we were left waiting half an_hour without being seen ( and weren_'_t ther only ones !)
negative	because it was a weekend and they only had 0 staff on .
negative	i thought weekends would be the best time for most people to view cars ....
negative	anyway we returned in the week and after 00_minutes this time we were helped out and given a key to view a car .
negative	the key itself was broken which should have been an omen but on we went , enjoyed the test_drive even_though the car had no diesel in at all so we had to go back the next_day to adctually drive it , all we could do was look !
negative	in the end we payed and left , then straight_away things went_downhill .
negative	the day we were due to pick_up the car the guy dealing_with us was off ill , they had no idea we were even coming so had to wait while someone went off to find then clean the car in a hurry , must have taken over an_hour .
negative	the car went for it '_s mot before coming to us and failed with numerous advisorys which were conveniently absent from the mot we we given , though we know it had problems as it says on the governments own mot website !
negative	nothing at all was mentioned about them either .
negative	to pass the mot it needed a tyre , so they replaced just one even_though the other was near legal_limit , wipers were replaced as the old ones weren_'_t clearing the window even_though the " mark " was actually a huge scratch on the glass which really should not have passed , niether should the seatbelt that doesn_'_t retract any faster_than it would take a snail to cover the same distance ( we ' re_talking minutes here ).
negative	within 0 days we had the first engine fault light come up , having my own scanner i read the fault code and it told me the turbo was overboosting .
negative	when we rang them they claimed it was due to not being driven for a while and to give it a full_tank of fuel , suffice to say this didn_'_t work .
negative	being a self - clearing fault it went but came back daily if the car was even driven slightly hard ( like dring an over - take as often is / was the case ).
negative	dangerously when this light came on power would suddenly be lost leading to some very dangerous situations , not good when you have a gf and her 0 year_old in the car , performing what should easily be a safe text - book overtake .
negative	by the time we realised it wasn_'_t going away we ' d already gone over 0000 miles , which is all they allow for under warantee .
negative	i wonder_why it '_s so low ( 0000 miles or 0 month )?
negative	*_cough *_*_cough *.
negative	since then within 0 months the seat has broken , it '_s needed a new tyre , it turns_out they didn_'_t service it at all so we had to spend over £_000 on that , it has continuously givn error codes and engine warning lights , various_bits have fallen_off and to take the mickey now the turbo is only boosting at 0psi and we '_ve so_far spent_hundreds without getting to the bottom of why it '_s so slow now , can '_t even keep_up with a petrol tanker going up a hill ( true story :( ).
negative	also the steering_wheel column feels loose .
negative	their adverts currently state " we '_ll buy every car " and going by the standard they '_ll sell you any as well , even if it '_s clearly full of faults , as by the time you notice somethign isn_'_t right it '_s too late .
negative	the whole ordeal has_been terrible and considering we spent over £ 0000 on a car what we '_ve had start to finish has_been shockingly_bad , plus now we are stuck with a car that needs to last another 0 years but definately won_'_t without thousands being spent :'( i would say please don_'_t let them make a mug of you too , stay well away and use a company with a more professional_approach who will sell you something you should rightly get for your money and not something that will make life hell or even worse kill you .
negative	so i sent my ohone in for repair on the 00th_may 0000 , today is the 0th_june_0000 and i still yet to recieve my phone back .
negative	i had to go into two phones0u stores and the people were not helpful at all , they didn_'_t know what they were doing and ended_up having to speak to people over the phone .
negative	they said it would take around 00 days to get my phone repaired and sent back to me .....
negative	the phone had a slight_crack on the back so that had to be repaired before any warranty issues could be sorted_out , they didn_'_t email me saying that the back needed to be repaired i had to phone up chasing them .
negative	i once sent my old phone to htc and they repaired it and sent it back to me within a week , this is appalling and they have no excuse for taking so long
negative	we purchaced 0 tickets at twice the market value from viagogo , not problem we knew what the prices were before we bought them , only to find when we arrived the tickets were not valid due to duplication and we had to buy three more ticket to gain_entry to strickley come dancing on sat ( 00 . 00 . 00 ) the ticket supplier can not be trusted in the words of nia security , there was at_least 0 other people with the same tickets , alway buy from a secure sourse 0 tickets have cost us 000 + , we spoke viagogo on sunday who were not interest , we have sent e , mail and copies of e , mail from security of the nia still no reponce shocking
negative	in fairness to via gogo a full_refund as been payed thank_you now 00 . 00 . 00
negative	had one of these_cowboys come to my door to sign us up , i was out but the wife was at home .
negative	she said she wasn_'_t interested but before she knew it the salesman had stepped inside and walked_into our living_room .
negative	scared the wife , scared the kids , but when i tried to report the guy to talktalk , they claimed they had no way of knowing who was working where !
negative	absolutely despicable company , wouldn_'_t touch them with a bargepole !
negative	awful_awful_awful etc
negative	i sent some speakers back to them the left side one is faulty and they said they sent it to wharfdale for repair under_warranty 0_weeks_later i recieved the speakers back in the same box and same bubble_wrap i packaged them in with a cover note saying they had sent them to wharfdale and the speaker were operating within spec , absolute_rubbish the left hand speaker is less_than half the power of the right i have tested my system and it isnt at fault they offered to take my speakers back for checking again but i have lost all trust in this company would not recomend them they basically wasted 0_weeks and did nothing but lie to me .
negative	my wife enquired_about talk talks deal on their phone , internet and tv packages for her farther , the sales girl quoted free for the first three_months ( payment of line rental only ) and if they signed_up today the cost after 0 months would be £_00 . 00 including line rental and they would provide an engineer free of charge .
negative	i thought this is a good deal and decided to contact them to enquire_about the same deal for ourselves .
negative	the salesman seemed surprised when i explained the deal my wife was offered by
negative	another sales_adviser , he was insistent that no such deal was available , i asked to speak to the manager and asked_him to listen to the recorded conversation , he firstly looked on their system and
negative	informed me that my farther in laws details were on their system however no such deal had been recorded .
negative	to make_matters_worse there was no apology , my conclusion was that this companies sales advisers cannot be trusted , so i decided not to pursue my interest further and told the manager to delete my
negative	farther in laws details from their system and not to proceed with this enquiry .
negative	when sold eye cataract surgery was told i would not need glasses , my eyesight has_improved only slightly and i keep going back and complaining and just get fobbed_off with excusess the latest thing is giving me some glasses to wear .
negative	on my last visit i was told i have too high an expectation £ 0000 for a slight improvement and still need glasses i dont_think so .
negative	0 monthes since operation unlikely its going to improve .
negative	regards
negative	john_lewis
negative	ps my sister angela lewis wants the operation what do you think i should say to her ?
negative	update to this review
negative	yesterday the 00th of may 0000 i had another appointment with a optomerist who said nothing can be done but he will make an appointment for me to see the surgeon who performed the operation he also said my eyesight had greatly_improved which is a lie these_people fob you off with excuses and try to make you believe your imagining things .
negative	i put on my old specs and guess_what i could see perfect and without glasses i get ghosting i also get wicked dry_eye '_s i told this to the optomerist and he said thats just because he had been messing_around with my eye '_s .
negative	i really wish i never had this done
negative	i ordered the christmas flowers for my wife - red_roses and red lilies in the grandisimo .
negative	they were delivered saturday i arrived home from work abroad today and asked where the flowers were the sorry looking bunch pointed_out to me were neither red nor grandisimo .
negative	i also was advised to buy a vase which is a con as the flowers such as they were would never in a month of sundays have fitted .
negative	well lesson_learned , local_florist in future .
negative	i have used ryanair twice and on both_occasions i found the service to be unacceptable even for a bargain airline .
negative	once i took my bike with me for which i paid twice as much as for my flight , but they treated me like i was some sort of parasite .
negative	i got no help whatsoever , the desk person was extremely rude , i had to find the man to do the outsize check in and find out where to take the bike afterwards .
negative	compare this to jet0 who are always welcoming and polite and make the experience easier .
negative	it usually costs me about an extra £_00 - 00 pounds to use another airline - well_worth it .
negative	i ordered goods 0_weeks_ago .
negative	they have taken the money from my credit_card account but so_far i have received nothing .
negative	not even an email to say what has happened .
negative	website has no phone number to contact , email gets an auto response .
negative	still hoping to get the goods , but not counting on it .
negative	never use again .
negative	will report to trading_standards if i don_'_t get something from them soon .
negative	on 0 june i purchased 00 tickets from viagogo for a concert at somerset house on 00 july for a total_cost of £_000 . 00 .
negative	not sure what the mark up on the face value was but probably substantial .
negative	on 00 july ( ie the day before the concert ) " diego " from viagogo telephoned to apologise and say that they would not be able to supply me with the tickets .
negative	huh_?
negative	a huge disappointment and inconvenience for me and the 0 friends and work_colleagues i had invited to the concert .
negative	please do not be_fooled_by viagogo '_s claim that they give a 000_% guarantee .
negative	they do not guarantee that they will supply you with tickets .
negative	only that they will try to get you tickets and if they fail to do so they may give you your money back .
negative	eric baker you fat greedy fraud - one day you will pay the price for your crimes .
negative	i sold a number of goods on two occasions .
negative	both_times they have not sent the full agreed payment - due to missing or items that don_'_t meet some mysterious specification .
negative	when questioned they just refer you to t and cs - no explanation , no return of goods , its a scam , as i know goods were prefect and all included .
negative	i was going to video them being packed if i ever used them again , however this is a common_practice - see other posts .
negative	i won_'_t use them again .
negative	i orderred a torch from you 0 days ago .
negative	i have had a message_saying it was despatched last friday and a message asking am i satisfied with it .
negative	i have sent 0 messages saying i have not received it .
negative	no reply to either .
negative	i am now wondering is there such a company as uktoolcentre or have i been ripped_off .
negative	i wonder will i get a reply to this .
negative	i ordered a phone two_weeks_ago and have had nothing but lies and incompetence from handtec . co . uk .
negative	they have promised on numerous_occasions that it was en_route , however it has still not arrived .
negative	it was marked as being in stock for next_day delivery , then i waited several days and heard_nothing .
negative	i contacted them and they said it had been sent , but it clearly had not .
negative	then they said it was sent to the wrong_address and didn_'_t have another phone to replace it .
negative	meanwhile the web_page for the product still says the phone is in stock .
negative	what a bunch of liars .
negative	do not waste your time with these_crooks .
negative	numbergroup '_s t &_cs say that " at_least thirty ( 00 ) days notice will be given prior to suspension for non - payment " but in my case they cut_off my business lines on february_00th after one ( 0 ) days notice for a bill that had been due for payment ( they allege ) within 00 days of february 0st ( previous invoices had allowed 00 days to pay ).
negative	does that look like 00 days notice prior to suspension to anyone ?
negative	the functionality of the web_site is good , but the customer service ( and the abilty to add up !)
negative	are from the dark_ages .
negative	i could have paid £ 0 to a street vender and got better flowers than what were delivered to my wife for her_birthday , how a florist can deliver such a disgraceful display of flowers is beond belief .
negative	i will never use e_- florist again .
negative	direct0florist . com are 000_% better value .
negative	i ordered a pair of zipp carbon bars an aluminium stem , both listed as in stock and at a good price .
negative	placed the order and confirmation received , so_far so good .
negative	then the out of stock email , 0 month delay , now another email 0 month delay !
negative	i have canceled the order !
negative	avoid !
negative	i ordered self_assembly guest beds .
negative	goods delivered ok
negative	when unpacked 0 item missing
negative	when constructing found that 0 piece had been incorrectly drilled and was unable to continue .
negative	called customer_services held on for 00_minutes , finally hang up without and answer at the cost of £ 0 : 00 .
negative	e_mailed customer_services explaining the position and asked them to call me back .
negative	they sent me an e_mail_stating that their spares team will contact me within 00_hours but i '_m not at all confident that this will happen , i '_m_sure that i will be calling them .
negative	i find that the product is of poor quality and their customer_services are very inefficient compared to other on line companies .
negative	i suggest that argos follow the example of other on line companies e . g .
negative	pine_solutions , appliances on lines and , bath store for proactive customer_services and efficiency .
negative	words fail me as to how bad this parcel delivery company are .
negative	i was supposed to have had a parcel delivered on the monday_morning however i did not receive it at all that day , i checked my online order details with littlewoods & it told me that the parcel had been loaded on to the van at the lincoln depot however i did not receive it that day .
negative	i contacted littlewoods the next_day as it is virtually_impossible to get in touch with yodel & they told me that the parcel had been taken back to the yodel depot on the day that i should have got it for some unknown_reason .
negative	i was then told by littlewoods that they would get in touch with yodel & that i would recive it the next_morning , however i still did not get it until the next evening at about 0 : 00 & even then the driver_knocked on the door & didn_'_t give me a second to get to the door so left my package hanging out of the letterbox on the outside of the door .
negative	this is not the first time i have had problems with yodel they have messed me about with orders in the past now .
negative	the service from this company is absolutely_appalling .
negative	i booked a lesson on the bsm website for a certain date but was very disappointed when after that date bsm had still not found me a driving_instructor & did not even bother to contact me to inform_me about the matter .
negative	i cancelled the lesson as i was disappointed with there poor service & asked for a refund i was told it would take seven working_days for a full_refund to be paid back in to my account , after seven day '_s i had still not received a refund i contacted bsm again to inform them about this when they assured me that a refund would be made right away only i was still_waiting for a refund seven_days after that .
negative	the service from bsm is very poor indeed .
negative	autorenew takes money from your account every year without them sending an invoice as they claim - avoid this company at all costs - google easyspace payment scam for hundreds of other_peoples experiences - also check out easyspace complaints on facebook
negative	my response to the easyspace reply
negative	i closed_down this website in 0000 so would not have attempted to use the control_panel since then - i was unaware that you were still billing me for the website address until i caught the payment being taken from my credit_card today - you have not been emailing me invoices each year as you claim - the last email i received from you was 00 / 00 /_0000 - i am looking at either taking_legal_action through the small_claims court or via the financial_ombudsman as you have been taking payment without invoice
negative	wrong part was sent but returns_procedure very good .
negative	i ordered a large bouquet of flowers and my fiancée had a small bouquet of flowers delivered .
negative	there was only one rose and a couple of smaller flowers , surrounded_by filling leaves .
negative	it did not look like tr pictures on the website , and was very poor value for money .
negative	previous order arrived damaged half product missing and monster_supplements advisor said thats the way it goes
negative	booked car for our trip to be collected at cape_town airport , collected car & drove to hotel .
negative	next time we used car was to go into cape_town & that '_s when problem_arose .
negative	we completed our business & went back to car which would not start at all .
negative	phoned dollar / thrifty to report problem , they came back & said they ' re sending replacement car .
negative	the replacement car took more than an_hour to get to us , we had to pay extra for parking & when car arrived the tank was not full as they had driven from the airport to cape_town , speedo reading showed more than 00kms driven .
negative	returned car on the due date with a full_tank of petrol .
negative	car checked & agreed that there would be no further charges for us .
negative	on checking credit_card statement we now find that an additional_fee of r000 . 00 for petrol has_been charged .
negative	i have registered a dispute with my bank & now wait for outcome .

negative	went into the derby store to buy a sim only deal because i already had a phone and just needed a sim_card for a few_months .
negative	after being given a sim only contract at a good price and assured that i could cancel it with 00 days notice with notice , i proceeded to use it for about 0 months .
negative	then my phone broke and i had to cancel the sim only deal .
negative	i went to the shop and was told they couldn_'_t do it and i had to ring customer_services .
negative	after ringing the extortionate customer service line , i was politely told that i had been misinformed by the shop and that i was on a 00 month business deal and had to pay £_000 to cancel it .
negative	i had not been told any of this information and was ever so slightly peeved .
negative	therefore i would recommend not going near o0 and especially near the derby store unless you happen to be riding a bulldozer .
negative	as the title_says ... hidden_costs everywhere .
negative	my original order for business_cards came with distorted text .
negative	i asked for order to be corrected , but another batch of distorted cards arrived .
negative	no explanation , no apology , no communication .
negative	i telephoned but the woman i spoke to was uncertain_about my problem , claimed she couldn_'_t see my previous attachment to an email , and was generally pretty clueless .
negative	i will not use goodprint again - their customer_relations attitude is poor .
negative	because of inaccurate description i ordered wrong item .
negative	i refused the offer to return item for refund as the postage was more than the item value , and there is no refund of postage .
negative	so if i returned the item , i would no_longer have it ( obviously ) and i would be more out of pocket than if i kept it , ( and obviosuly still had the item !)
negative	very poor service .
negative	bought two_sets of decals one set was fine , the other were clearly ancient stock , with a white residue on the printing and signs of water_damage .
negative	emailed hannants requesting return and refund , and was completely_ignored .
negative	after a couple of email '_s i gave up and reclaimed the money through paypal .
negative	they ignored paypal too , so ( eventually ) i got the refund under paypal '_s default system .
negative	clearly these_people are happy to send out rubbish and ignore any complaints in the hope that people will give up .
negative	i certainly won_'_t use them again .
negative	i advise you not to as well , and i have forwarded all the emails to their local tso for their consideration
negative	i was let_down by another supplier so i rang plumbnation to see if they had stock of the radiator .
negative	they said they had it in their warehouse and i could have it in 0 working_days .
negative	fantastic , so i did the order there and then on the phone .
negative	i double_checked to make_sure it was their warehouse as_opposed to delonghi '_s as i already knew that they did not have stock .
negative	three_days_later i get an email_saying it is out of stock and will take 0 - 0_weeks .
negative	i have rang them twice and they take_forever to answer ( just like an energy company ) and then having taken the order on the phone , they can '_t take a cancellation .
negative	for that i have to email them .
negative	ironically , because of what i thought was excellent customer service , i ordered two more radiators !
negative	i '_m now waiting for the cancellation confirmation .
negative	a pretty poor customer experience in the extreme .
negative	this company have wrecked my home .
negative	had windows fitted in february , they turned_up and put lots of dust sheets down which i thought was good .
negative	what i found afterwards was they shook them out in the rooms we had crap everywhere .
negative	the fitter then ask us to sing some paper_work tell us that it was the delivery note for the windows that needed signing on 0 form as there was no carbon copy 0 form was placed over the first with just the signature line showing .
negative	what we signed was a satisfaction form to say we were satisfied with the job .
negative	at this point we had not looked at any widows other than the one in the kitchen where we were stood this looked good from the inside and the fitter told us he would be back the next_day to finish of around windows with some trim which he did not have on van .
negative	at this point it was starting to get dark so we thanks and off he went .
negative	this is when we found all the crap spread over the rest of the house along with mastic spread all over the frames and window revels .
negative	it took me and my wife nearly 0 hours to clean up .
negative	the next_day we looked outside what a " f_*** ing mess .
negative	there was mastic all over the bricks around windows it looked like he had removed the nozzle from the gun and spread it around with a trowel .
negative	we are now trying to get it resolved they have so_far sent 0 different fitter '_s around but neither of them were prepared to try and put this right in the time they had .
negative	after sending a email to the ceo and sending copies of complaints letters to them via_recorded delivery we had a visit from a manager , who has agreed to replace 0 window with a new one take out another one and refit correctly and clean off some of the mastic .
negative	we have a date for this for 00 may , 0 months after the first installation .
negative	will up date this after this date .
negative	sent my blackberry after they quoted £_00 . 00 on website , emailed me back with revised_offer of £_00 . 00 due to excessive_wear & tear ( it was in perfect_condition ).
negative	had to pay £ 0 . 00 to get my phone back , then sent to mazuma who paid £_00 . 00 same day they got it .
negative	my advice don_'_t go near !!!!
negative	!
negative	i purchased a slection pack of ear_plugs at snorestore . co . uk for £_00 so i could_find out which type i was suited to .
negative	they sent me so many plugs which were the same - these where so large that they keep falling out .
negative	the only type that was effective and smaller was sent along with all the others , on its own .
negative	so not reqally good customer service .
negative	sorry to have to moan .
negative	sent iphone and payment and then heard_nothing for the best part of 0_weeks .
negative	no replies to my phone_calls or emails , of which i made or sent many .
negative	phone came back today ( not repaired ) via_royal_mail - thank_you for that .
negative	no work completed but payment still processed by rotten_apples .
negative	now taking steps through trading_standards to report the fraud and claiming via credit_card company .
negative	please beware .
negative	i thought the idea of this was excellent , order before 0pm for same day delivery .
negative	however the actual experience was deeply disappointing .
negative	i did this last saturday as i wanted to send some flowers but couldn_'_t get out to go to the local_florist .
negative	i ordered before 0 :_00pm and 00_minutes later got a call from eflorist saying they couldn_'_t fulfil my order as all the local_florists were closing half day .
negative	i explained that this wasn_'_t my problem , this site offered a service and surely they should find someone_who would fulfil the order , that '_s what they charge their fee for ?
negative	the lady i spoke to ( who was very polite ) just said they couldn_'_t do it .
negative	i asked to speak to a supervisor but was told they were busy and would call me back , they did not do this .
negative	i did explain to the lady i spoke to that i would be placing an adverse review if not called back , but they didn_'_t bother to call or to offer a solution .
negative	the web_site does not say " we might be able to deliver if we can find someone_who isn_'_t closing " it says order before 0pm and we will deliver same day .......
negative	it doesn_'_t say excluding saturdays , it specifically offers the service on a saturday , it doesn_'_t say excluding certain postcodes ...... in the end i rang the local_florist and was able to go collect the flowers later that day .
negative	real_shame that the concept of this web_site is not executed in reality .
negative	what added value is being derived if all the site does is ring round a bunch of local_florists ?
negative	i can do this but thought the idea was they saved me the hassle .
negative	the whole_experience was deeply disappointing .
negative	i now have the card of the local_florists and will use them directly in future .
negative	three_weeks before moving_house i emailed fu ( perfectly named ) to advise them that i would be sending them a final reading .
negative	on the due date i did this but heard_nothing .
negative	eight emails and three phone_calls later they have still not managed to send a final_bill , let_alone credit me with £_000 that they owe me .
negative	i have of course received an estimated bill reducing my credit by £_00 for a month i have not lived in the house .
negative	i am so frustrated by their useless customer service who cannot deal with the problem or send any kind of specific reply to emails .
negative	i can see that i shall have to sue them for the credit as they clearly have no_intention of accepting the fact that i have moved_house nor that i am owed money .
negative	do not get involved with company - they are thieves and should not be allowed to remain in business .
negative	after 0_weeks has elapsed from the beginning of your complaint , you should contact ofgem with all available evidence .
negative	it is unlikely that they will do anything being useless too , but at_least it logs into the statistical volume of complaints about these rogue companies .
negative	we ordered a leather_sofas which was delivered on time .
negative	sadly one of the delivery men managed to smash a picture on the wall .
negative	he promised that laura_ashley would pay for it and took photos as evidence .
negative	00 days_later a claim_form arrived asking for two repair estimates which we sent immediately .
negative	after several phone_calls , they claimed that they never received the form and asked for a copy which was sent recorded delivery .
negative	however despite another letter promising to pay followed_by five phone_calls to customer service and more recorded delivery letters , we cannot obtain a reply .
negative	it is now 0 months since delivery .
negative	i guess a solicitors letter is now the next option and / or a claim through the small_claims court .
negative	also it is time that watchdog took a serious look at the appalling stories .
negative	i ordered this item on wednesday 00th of december then the shipping was confirmed the next_day via 0nd_class royal_mail , after 0 working_days i have still not relieved it and will not get it in time to give to my mum at christmas .
negative	argento did not contact me with any_problems or if it has_been lost etc .
negative	bad_experience with argento and am defiantly not ordering from them again .
negative	oh and just to add i got an email_saying '' please review your item ''
negative	how can i review something i haven_'_t got ?
negative	!
negative	i also got a reply email basically helping with nothing and that they ' re having problems with delivery when there are people rating 0_star reviews and getting there item within 0 days .
negative	00 days passed no sign of delivery , terrible .
negative	my wife and i were looking for a nintendo dsi for our daughter '_s birthday and found this site .
negative	they were offering it at a good price and so we ordered on 00 june_0000 .
negative	they said it would be dispatched within_00hrs ; it wasn_'_t .
negative	our daughter '_s birthday was on 00 july and despite_numerous_emails and phonecalls ( more of which later ), we decided to cancel the order , which we did on 00 july_0000 and had to go to argos and buy one in store for significantly more money .
negative	in cancelling , we formally requested a full_refund , but despite_numerous further emails and phonecalls ( definately some more later !)
negative	we still do not have a refund , and today is 00 spetember 0000 .
negative	my wife has now contacted her card provider to raise a dispute in order to try and get our money back .
negative	by the way , in relation to the phone_calls , don_'_t bother ringing them , it simply a voicemail_message_telling you to email them ..... now thats customer service .
negative	i feel ashamed to have used this company now i have seen these other reviews .
negative	for anyone_else considering using these_people , please seriously_consider whether its worth it .
negative	chris
negative	i ordered a nikon l000 and case on 00 july_0000 , they said it would be delivered within 0 - 0 days , it wasn_'_t .
negative	i contacted them to ask what was going on as i needed it for a birthday_present and had ordered in good faith expecting delivery within timescales advertised .
negative	email response simply said they couldn_'_t gaurentee when i ' d get it .... not good enough .
negative	so i cancelled the order before the end of july .
negative	i spoke to their customer_services who said i ' d get a refund within 0 - 0 days and also got an email confirmation that they ' d received my cancellation .
negative	i still_haven_'_t received my refund and have had to resort to raising a dispute with my bank to see if they can get me my money back .
negative	i will never use this company again and would warn anyone_else from dealing_with them too .
negative	i took out van insurance , which i was told would mirror my no claims from the car .
negative	0_weeks on i have been told that it was mis sold - in order to mirror the no claims i have to be 00 ( which i am in 0 months ), but the sales_advisor didn_'_t check this criteria thus mis sold me the insurance !
negative	they have cancelled and refunded in full - but now i '_m stuck without insurance and since i can '_t mirror the no claims i have to pay £_000 more - i wouldn_'_t have bought the van had they have informed me when quoting !
negative	avoid !
negative	ordered some items off the website , 0 hours_later i receive a phone_call stating they will be cancelling my items !
negative	wont be using ever again !
negative	as an_avid user of parcels0go , i recently had a terrible experience .
negative	i sent a glass hob via them , and it was smashed in transit .
negative	parcels0go said it had been returned to them , so i didnt need to send photos of the damage , as they had the item .
negative	0_weeks_later without compensation , they then sent the item back , and demanded i sent images of the damage !
negative	what a joke !
negative	they then offered £_00 compensation for a £_000 item !
negative	!
negative	use someone_who actually care about the customer !
negative	i stayed in best_western in chicago and it was awful .
negative	i complained to corporate headquarters and they were worse than useless
negative	they kept handing it back to the hotel to deal with , if they are corporate hq the deal with complaints
negative	so be warned if you complain you will get bumped around from pillart to post !
negative	!
negative	cal themselves cheap ?
negative	?
negative	yeah till you see all the extras you get charged for !
negative	!
negative	food , luggage etc ..
negative	do not fly ryan_air , if you do it '_ll cost you more than with ba or any other company !
negative	!
negative	bought a suite , 00 / 0 / 00 , delivered 00 / 00 /_0000 .
negative	chair cushion filling nowhere_near as resilient as the settee cushion fillings .
negative	fira inspector agreed , but even the new filling is poor , ( paid extra for foam filling ).
negative	the fabric on the chair is inferior to that of the settee .
negative	csl will not respond to letters , or e_- mails .
negative	purchased the " love it guarantee " and even that is ignored by csl .
negative	will never purchase from csl .
negative	customer service poor .
negative	csl seem to be ignoring the sale of goods_act , in that the product should be " fit for purpose ".
negative	trading_standards has to be my next call .
negative	i placed this order for a special bouquet of flowers for my mother in law for mother '_s day .
negative	the flowers should have been delivered on either saturday or sunday , as specified when choosing the option " mothers_day weekend ".
negative	unfortunately , i discovered on the following_monday , that nothing had been delivered .
negative	i immediately contacted iflorist and spoke to a customer_services rep , who could provide no explanation , no satisfactory solution to the problem .
negative	the date for delivery had apparently been set for several_years previously , and the rep implied that the error must have been caused_by user fault with my laptop date being incorrect .
negative	i looked into the date issue and it is not possible to choose any date other than in the future .
negative	the rep seemed clueless and so i insisted on speaking to the customer_services manager .
negative	i was told the manager was not at work , so i asked for someone senior to contact me back within an_hour .
negative	0 hours_later , i telephoned again - nobody senior available yet again - i was promised that someone would call back that same day ,
negative	an_hour later , calls were being directed to an answermachine message and no online_chat_facility was available either .
negative	i am beyond exasperated with iflorist .
negative	i have been completely_ignored , accused of lying , error making , disbelieved , lied to , fobbed_off and iflorist have totally failed to adhere to their contract , accept any responsibility for the blunder and have made no attempt to apologise .
negative	i have only today received a full_refund - weeks after the company failed to deliver the flowers .
negative	needless to say , i shall not be using your company again and will be ensuring family and friends are aware of my experience .
negative	about a year_ago i paid for the upgrade which gives you certain benefits over their free service .
negative	somehow i accidentally paid for a years membership in one lump_sum rather_than for a monthly_subscription , this was an honest mistake so i wrote to them asking to change to the monthly_subscription and to be refunded the money i had paid .
negative	i got a rather curt reply from them saying i should have followed the instructions more carefully .
negative	needless to say i was amazed that such a large and successful company should have such poor customer service and i wrote back to tell them so .
negative	after this i received no reply at all but with no refund i could not take my business elsewhere .
negative	the membership has now expired but i just received an email from them today asking me to renew it .
negative	this is what prompted me to write this review to warn_others of their poor service .
negative	i booked and hired a car for 0_weeks in lanzarote , when i got there the car we had booked wasn_'_t available and we were offered a dinky instead and although it says on the contract that you can use a visa for booking it didn_'_t state that a visa_debit is not acceptable at your destination , therefore we could not actually complete our transaction and lost the whole booking and had to go to another ( far more efficient ) company and pay there in full , also we were not told that we must buy our fuel from the rental company prior to taking the car and must purchase extra_insurance that we didn_'_t want .
negative	tbh it was a total_con job , low price on booking but actually works out dearer in the long run .
negative	would never use them again .
negative	we received a confirmation_email_saying the order had been received , we also received a notification of dispath , but have not received anything yet .
negative	we have tried to contact by phone and email but cannot get an answer .
negative	i will be reporting this to credit_card company to try get my money back
negative	booked a courier to deliver an expensive coffee_machine and although the coffee_machine was boxed and packaged well with bubble_wrap and hard foam , the coffee_machine was in a very bad way internally when i opened the box .
negative	the coffee_machine packaging box had ' fragile ' written across the box clearly .
negative	however the coffee_machine was certainly not handled how customers expect fragile items to be handled .
negative	the internal mechanism made of think plastic was snapped in half with a massive crack running down the back of the machine and the door_hinge broke .
negative	all of this means the damage done to the machine is unfixable and unusable and therefore i requested compensation .
negative	they said it is not covered on the £_000 value of insurance i paid for - only loss !
negative	they say their website made me aware of this but i didn_'_t read as was in a hurry to book and didn_'_t think_twice that insurance wouldn_'_t cover damage , after all , there '_s only 0 things you want to be covered for - loss and damage .
negative	the force to brake the coffee_machine internally must have been really substantial to do the damage it dis_- a drop from a height would be the most plausible explanation for the damage which i felt unacceptable .
negative	i sent photo_evidence of this including packaging and close ups of the damage .
negative	still no compensation .
negative	i would highly not recommend this courier service to anyone .
negative	not even remotely close to what i ordered in colour of flowers used with cheaper substitutes used to bulk out the bunch massively .
negative	the six large gerberas pictured were replaced with two mini - heads .
negative	the vibrant multicoloured bunch i ordered were delivered entirely white and yellow ( but for the two red mini - gerberas ).
negative	customer service ' assured ' me that half a bunch of gyp and a stuffing of carnations are of equal value and quality to gerberas , lisianthis and chrysanthemums .
negative	avoid like the plague .
negative	just didn_'_t bother turning_up with my flowers on mother '_s day .
negative	left my mother waiting all day for them .
negative	had no customer service available on the sunday itself , so i waited_until the monday .
negative	they have no phone number so you have to wait for an adviser to speak to you online - so they closed the service for the entire day .
negative	i finally got an email and they offered to deliver the following_day ( mothering tuesday ?!)
negative	at full cost .
negative	out of the goodness of their hearts they did offer me £ 0 off my next order though , as if i ' d ever order from them again to benefit .
negative	i couldn_'_t recommend enough using one of the ' proper ' flower retailers on line rather_than this bunch of jokers .
negative	i don_'_t think i '_ve ever been so angry .
negative	i ordered a game , but had no email from moby_memory ( ext ref removed ) either to confirm the order , or to say it had been despatched .
negative	i emailed them a week_later to ask whether it had been sent , saying i ' d heard_nothing .
negative	a week_later , they replied , sending a claim_form because they said it had been despatched .
negative	i returned the claim_form , and waited .
negative	a week_later , no response , so i resent it and asked if they ' d received it .
negative	a week_later again , still nothing , so i asked them to just give me a refund .
negative	another week_later , still nothing , so i filed a paypal_dispute .
negative	this kicked them into action , and they immediately refunded my money along with the following message :
negative	---
negative	" your first return back to us as -- not called for
negative	from royalmail -- means you did not pick_up the item .
negative	due to the christmas_break and office open on 0th do not help with the delays in answer emails or phone ,
negative	there has_been breakdown in the internet which has deleted the emails ."
negative	---
negative	so ...
negative	( 0 ) supposedly they sent it and and was returned to them .
negative	not only have i not had a royal_mail card through the door , but considering the other reviews here , does anyone really think it likely that they ' re telling the truth ?
negative	( 0 ) " you did not pick_up the item " all capitalised .
negative	not the most professional way to deal with your customers is it ?
negative	( 0 ) the christmas / new year break has no relevance whatsoever - the total_lack of communication all dates from after the 0th of january .
negative	( 0 ) " there has_been breakdown in the internet ".
negative	classic , absolutely classic !
negative	so in all , it '_s full of excuses , and it took the threat of a claim_against them through paypal , before they ' d do anything .
negative	i cannot stress enough , buy elsewhere !
negative	this company attracts people to their network with low_prices and generous deals but heaven_forbid you have any reason to call customer_services or wish to cancel .
negative	this is where they have obviously saved money by employing poorly_trained operators .
negative	i received a poor service , aggressive sales calls and it took a 00 minute phone_call to leave them at the end of the contract with the rep trying every trick and almost begging me to reconsider .
negative	i ordered an offfice chair and desk for my new office .
negative	the chair arrived but they did not inform_me that the desk was out of stock .
negative	ever tried to work on just a chair ?
negative	i had to chase them twice by email and twice by telephone - no one answered it was just an answering mahine .
negative	i will not use them again .
negative	they say they '_ve been when they havn '_t
negative	they say they will deliver and they won_'_t
negative	they promise the earth but won_'_t deliver
negative	avoid at all costs !!
negative	!
negative	i '_ve read bad_reports about poor service from delivery companies before , the likes of yodel and parcel farce , but these really take the micky , if you do use them and they let you down i told you so !
negative	they only get one star because zero isn_'_t an option .
negative	i ordered flowers for my wife as i had to be away on our_anniversary .
negative	they delivered the flowers to the wrong_address and when i contacted them i was told that they would investigate .
negative	the first email said that they had been delivered .
negative	i informed them that they hadn_'_t and now , 0 month later i am still_waiting for their reply .
negative	being serious .
negative	i can help you but want more than 0 %
negative	your site is aaallllllllllllll wrong
negative	my product was delivered very fast , unfortunately it was spilled over the delivery van floor .
negative	both the outer and inner packaging were damaged .
negative	this mishap was reported to myprotein immediately by the delivery company and myself .
negative	to date ( nearly one week_later ) and after 0 emails and reports to myprotein no response has_been provided except an auto response from customer_services acknowledging_receipt of my complaint .
negative	i have been a customer of myprotein for many_years supporting them when they were a small , dedicated and simple operation .
negative	now i feel that they have lost these simple roots in their desperation for growth .
negative	city_link recently lost a consignment of ours worth over £ 0000 and when we claimed for our losses they quoted their t '_s &_c '_s and paid us a paltry_£_000 in compensation .
negative	last_week a requested before 0 . 00 am delivery to our customer only left their depot at 0 . 00 am .
negative	today they were supposed deliver to a manchester city_centre office block and when the package didn_'_t arrive on time they said that they " had left next door ".
negative	lazy drivers , non_existent account_managers and an impregnable phone system that can keep you on hold for up to an_hour .
negative	total rubbish .
negative	avoid at all cost .
negative	i bought a item online and was given the option of getting the item deliverd to a different address that the my card was registerd to .
negative	i wanted it deliverd to the site i am working at the moment as my card is regesterd to my office over 00 miles_away .
negative	on the day of delivery i was sent a message_saying that the would not deliver to the site i was working at but only to the address that the card is registered to .
negative	this meant that i had to pay to make_sure someone was in the office and also then had to pay for a courier to delivery it to site .
negative	why was i given the option when i order it to have it delivered to another address if this is not possible .
negative	not happy
negative	we placed an order online for a shirt , which was shown with a tie , expecting delivery of a shirt and tie .
negative	we collected from store - but only a shirt was received .
negative	when we asked about the tie , it ended in an argument with an unhelpful salesperson !
negative	the following week , we ordered three items and debenhams emailed confirmation of the order same day .
negative	that was 00 days ago and nothing more from debenhams !
negative	we have telephoned the store , but for the past week , all they can say is that the order has_been ' despatched '.
negative	the store say they are not informed of the date of despatch , so there is every chance that orders are being lost / stolen or misplaced !
negative	!
negative	there is also the strong possibility in this case that our order has_been received by the store but deliberately ' lost ' in the system !
negative	!
negative	needless to say , this will be our last order with debenhams !
negative	!
negative	very very disappointing when it comes to try and speak to someone .
negative	waited over 00_minutes without_success .
negative	despite constant attempts to get in touch with this company ( including having to do research and get a different number from another site he '_s involved with , petrotools ) i still have no goods or refund after 0 year .
negative	i did manage to speak to this keith guy a few_times , who would always assure me that he would get my order out the following_day , citing staff illness as the cause of the delay .
negative	needless to say , nothing ever happened even after he said he ' d refund my money .
negative	this is blatant theft .
negative	i gave up trying to chase my money and will be more careful in future .
negative	mothers_day flowers not delivered - i was on holiday and so couldn_'_t be with my mother on day so figured some flowers were the least i could do .
negative	thanks iflorist for ruining that for me .
negative	sent three emails so_far and nothing in response - their livechat never seems to be on .
negative	essentially this company has stolen £_00 from me .
negative	i ordered the cartridges vide my order cs000000 - lv000000 on 00 / 00 / 00 .
negative	i rang up jersey cartridge_shop .
negative	i was told that the goods should reach me by 00 may .
negative	today is 00 may and i am still_waiting for the goods .
negative	you can_imagine the reasons for my dis_- satisfaction !
negative	i need to be compensated for wastage of my time and money over making these unnecessary enquiries .
negative	amar . daroch @ ntlworld . com
negative	avoid at all costs .
negative	they cancelled my direct debt which they said was due to technical problems did not advise of any_problems until getting a letter asking for payment .
negative	resolved problem by making due payment but was still chased by their debt_collectors for payment which had already been made and whose non payment was the fault of talk_talk .
negative	frankly they are then worse firm i have ever_dealt_with , cannot be trusted and would advise any body not to touch these with a barge_pole .
negative	parking on departure - flawless
negative	check - in - flawless
negative	security - intrusive sexually .
negative	flight - flawless
negative	holiday - flawless
negative	return flight - flawless
negative	car_park exit - faulty .
negative	both cars in front had difficulties leaving .
negative	my turn came and sign read that i had to pay another £_00 .
negative	i paid in full in advance so was not best pleased .
negative	eventually someone answered the call button and eventually allowed to leave .
negative	not impressed so one star only .
negative	a refund will stop me from advising friends from using long tern car_park .
negative	i have never requested anything from badoo , and now two of my email accounts are filling up with unsolicited junk from them .
negative	when i click the unsubscribe link , the server cannot be found .
negative	avoid these_people .
negative	i ordered flowers for mothers_day which is probably why when i opened the box i found squashed flowers .
negative	my brother ordered them for the day before , his were also squashed and almost all of them were actually dead , i selected unreasonable and rude because there is no way that they were sent without it being known that they were dead .
negative	won_'_t order again , it is massively overpriced for the quality , i will get them from the bottom of my road as usual .
negative	was well in the web_site but we did not received any thing
negative	you policy seems against buisness ?
negative	ordered a pair of alpinestars joey waterproof shoe tarmac in suede , unfortunately shiny leather arrived .
negative	they are ok but given the cost to return and the associated hassle i am better off keeping them , especially when they can '_t even be_bothered to reply to my email .
negative	no way would i use this company again
negative	i had to cancel my order as it didnt arrive in the time i required .
negative	i asked for a refund asap which can be done on the same day .
negative	i received an arrogant reply_stating check terms and conditions .
negative	they are refund within 00 days .
negative	they have made no effort to refund and we are now on the 00th day .
negative	i do not expect a refund before the 00th day
negative	one customer £_000
negative	one thousand customers a nice little 00 days of interest .
negative	they wil not get custom from me in the future they can keep prices low as their business appears to be making money with other_peoples money , if not why no refund at the earliest_opportunity ??
negative	?
negative	a very thick cast_iron manhole !!
negative	it was before parcel0go and insurance we '_ll see - not much hope .
negative	paypal is extremely unhelpful in dealing_with customers and blocks their payments with no justifiable reason .
negative	because e_- bay is so heavily reliant on paypal i have ceased buying from e_- bay altogether now
negative	this is a warning
negative	avoid my uk delivery like the plague this is my sad story of how i lost my hard_earned_money to them ,
negative	i first contacted myukdelivery on the 00 / 00 / 00 and on this day we exchanged 0 emails between me and becky checking details .
negative	i then contacted myukdelivery on the 00th to confirm and myukdelivery sent me a payment link on the 00 / 00 / 00 for £_00 which i paid ( this is 0 times the price that parcelmonkey would deliver it for but i paid to get a morning slot ).
negative	i didn_’_t get a confirmation or even acknowledgement of payment so i emailed myukdelivery on the 00 / 00 / 00 they didn_’_t reply !
negative	i tried to ring myukdelivery countless_times on the 00 / 00 / 00 to check they were coming but myukdelivery didn_’_t answer , i then emailed at 00 . 00 as they were meant to be with me by 0 , myukdelivery replied with
negative	hi clive .
negative	please email support @ myukdelivery . co . uk
negative	kind_regards
negative	which i did and at 00 . 00 myukdelivery replied
negative	hi james
negative	i am sorry for this .
negative	i will chase this up with the local_depot now for you .
negative	kind_regards
negative	strangely my name had changed ?
negative	i replied with “ thank_you but i do have to get taken to the hospital soon and my phone number ”
negative	i then stayed in till 00 . 00 when i sent myukdelivery another email
negative	“ i have stayed in an extra half hour but am going to have to rush now !
negative	i have to tell the customer he won_’_t have the suspension for his car ( needed for his mot ) tomorrow as well aren ’_t i ?
negative	unless you can collect this evening ?
negative	yours unimpressed and my phone number again ”
negative	myukdelivery emailed me back at 00 . 00 ( bear in mind i had told them i had left for the hospital and given my phone number ) to say
negative	“ hi james
negative	i am going to see what we can sort_out for you .
negative	i will respond shortly .
negative	kind_regards
negative	whilst at the hospital i rang lots of times but no answer neither did i receive a phone_call so when i got back from the hospital i emailed myukdelivery at 00 . 00 saying
negative	“ what ’_s happening ?
negative	you won_’_t answer either phone now but your voice_message says you will respond in 0 hours to emails but i haven ’_t had any response since 00 : 00 ?
negative	i have paid as my bank has verified and i am waiting to hear from you so i can tell my customer what ’_s happening or whether i have to return his £_000 ?
negative	yours unimpressed clive
negative	at 0000 on the 00 / 00 / 00 after not having had a response from myukdelivery since 00 . 00 i emailed saying
negative	as you will not answer the phone or respond to my emails
negative	i want a full_refund for the collection you haven ’_t collected and feel i should be compensated for my loss of earnings and the loss of my sale and tarnishing my good reputation ( check my feedback ) and the fact i will have to take another day off work if i am lucky_enough to sell it again .
negative	i expect to hear from you with my refund by end of business tomorrow as i have paid for a service i have not received !
negative	i received no answer from myukdelivery until after i left bad_reviews for them , myukdelivery then answered me on the 0st dec saying my refund is being_processed !
negative	i haven ’_t seen a refund over 0_weeks_later and strangely when i paid it was out of my account the same day ?
negative	i lost half a day ’_s wages waiting in for myukdelivery as well as the £_00 and the sale so don_’_t believe the convenient good reviews that appear about them or their replies as the ones they have made about my reviews are not true .
negative	i don_'_t expect this review to stay up long as myukdelivery keep getting my honest factual reviews removed !
negative	yet i am hundreds out of pocket because of them and have all the emails between me and myukdelivery which i will be putting up on a blog .
negative	bought three items in one batch to update my personal pc workstation :
negative	one item was a mouse - very cheap , packaging wasn_'_t great , but it arrived working and in decent condition .
negative	one item was a monitor .
negative	came with a power_lead , but did not come with a lead to connect the monitor to the tower .
negative	this was unbeknown to me at the time of purchase , although easily_rectified by a quick look through another competing online shopping website * coughamazoncough *
negative	the final item was a set of pc speakers .
negative	this item was lacking a power_lead ( i had presumed the power would come from the inbuilt pc connection ), and was not informed the item needed an external power source , or that the cable would not be supplied .
negative	further , upon_contacting the store via_email - as suggested in confirmation emails from cashgenerator . co . uk - i have not had my issue solved .
negative	indeed , i have not even had a response from the store in question .
negative	overall , not great - 0 / 0 products were not fit for purpose , and one of those is unable to be tested due to the uncommon power_supply needed .
negative	ordered good grips liquiseal travel mug on 00 / 00 / 00 .
negative	chose to purchase item from this site because it said ' fast delivery on this item '.
negative	having not received the item by 00 / 00 / 00 , i contacted customer service who_apologised and promised delivery week_commencing 00 / 00 / 00 .
negative	they also agreed to remove the ' fast delivery on this item ' from the internet as it is clearly misleading .
negative	it is now the evening of 00 / 00 / 00 and i have still not received the item .
negative	even more annoying is the fact that it still says ' fast delivery on this item ' against this product on the internet .
negative	00 / 00 / 00 - update
negative	it is now over a month since i ordered the product with ' fast delivery ' yet it still has not arrived and i have heard_nothing from customer_services as to why .
negative	and yes , it still says ' fast delivery on this item ' against this product on the internet .
negative	i am perplexed as to how this company gets so many good reviews and wonder_whether they are genuine .
negative	recently_purchased a htc phone , received a tv 0 days_later !
negative	they claimed they have ' no stock ' of the phone , refunded the postage for returning the tv .
negative	waited two_weeks , cancelled my order .
negative	the phone was ' in stock ' a day later but was £_00 more_expensive !
negative	good place to sell unwanted things but the company charges too much on conmission , with paypal .
negative	you ' re likely to find a better deal elsewhere online .
negative	ordered a riedel sommeliers single_malt_whisky crystal glass ( height : 000mm 0 0 / 0 "), arrived quickly within 00 hr after the email notification .
negative	the tiny 0 . 0 " glass came in a huge 00 x 00 x 0 inch box filled with mostly nonrecyclable polyester foam fillings .
negative	may i suggest using shredded kraft paper or just old newspaper in future ?
negative	selections took payment 00 days before delivery , and took 00 days to despatch with no notification of delay .
negative	so i have been financing their business and my apples have been rotting whilst awaiting delivery of the storage_unit .
negative	if i could rate with no stars , i would .
negative	after buying a pair of seeland wellington_boots on line i found within a month or so they had split on the heel .
negative	i promptly packaged them up and returned them to uttings .
negative	that was a few_months_ago i '_ve had no word back as yet .
negative	the shooting season restarts in september so maybe i will get a reply before then .
negative	i ordered a delivery for ( rather expensive ) flowers for valentines_day to go to an address in belgium .
negative	the flowers were not delivered on the day or on the following_day .
negative	as a result i emailed ( they dont have a telephone_number !)
negative	requesting a refund .
negative	i received no reply until 0 days_later when i received a ' reply ' completely_ignoring my previous message and stating that the address was wrong .
negative	now given that the address was exactly the same address i had provided them with for a previous successful delivery this seems a little strange to put it mildly .
negative	so $_00 paid in return for which ... no flowers delivered , no response to a refund request , impossible to speak to someone as they have no phone number and they send an email 0 days after the flowers were due for delivery saying a building they have previously delivered to does not exist .
negative	draw your own_conclusions ...
negative	driver dumped the tiles outside house and did not deliver into the house !!
negative	had to get builder who i pay to move into house so they didn_'_t get nicked or soaked in the rain !
negative	!
negative	i joined first_utility in december_0000 .
negative	in the year i was with them i was never once able to submit a meter_reading ( due to their incompetent staff and website ) and therefore had to pay the maximum every singe month .
negative	since moving out of my property at the end of november last_year i can '_t get them to close my account .
negative	they won_'_t respond to emails , if i call them they say they are too_busy to deal with my issue .
negative	every_month they continue to send me bills for a property i don_'_t live in .
negative	this company are now causing me a great deal of stress and i am genuinely getting ill because of it .
negative	finances are always of a great concern to me and having this company refusing to close my account / issue a bill is slowly driving me to the edge .
negative	i would advise anyone to avoid this company like the plague unless you wan '_t to be overcharged , treated_like a fool , and have an insane amount of stress thrown upon you .
negative	booked and paid for an oil and filter_change online , rang to ask best time to call in for it doing and was told that my local halifax branch would not honour the booking even_though i had already paid online . he stated to buy the oil in would cost too much therefore they would not do the job !.
negative	i rang the online booking team who rang another branch who also refused the job !, i was then toid i would have to wait 0 to 0 for a refund .
negative	what a load of rubbish this company is .
negative	the whole order was delivered in one package on 00th_december but when i opened it up , the nike class wov suit in navy / blue size medium tracksuit was missing the trousers .
negative	i fully checked through the bag but i appear to have only been sent the tracksuit top and not the bottoms .
negative	i tried to call customer_services twice as i hadn_'_t heard back via_email , both_times i have been put onto hold for around 00_minutes .
negative	when i finally got through to the advisor on the end of the line , my order reference was taken and then i was cut_off when i was put back onto hold .
negative	we recently got our bedroom furtniture done from them .... and everything from_start to end was crap / incorrect / below standard .
negative	we spent £ 0000 on one bedroom and what we got in the end was wrong design , furniture quality is poor , 0 week of planning which in the end wasn_'_t even used and so much inconvenience .
negative	they even lost my papers from their system and asked the fitter to bring a copy of my documents from my photocopier .
negative	i made several complaints and finally got just £ 0000 refunded for total_waste job .
negative	i am even thinking of going to consumer watchdog - they shouldn_'_t even let such companies exist .
negative	a few weeks_ago i returned home to find a " we tried to deliver " card in the door and the front_gate wide open .
negative	i went on - line and scheduled a redelivery when i would be home but no delivery attempt was made so it was a wasted day .
negative	various attempts to email receive only standard useless replies and i am still_waiting for my delivery .
negative	seemingly parcelforce expect people to collect parcels from their depot which in my case is about 0 0 / 0 hour journey ( one way ) - if you have means to get there .
negative	they do give options such as paying £ 0 to have the parcel delivered to the nearest post_office but as i don_'_t work near where we live , this is no option as its always closed when we are around .
negative	theres also an option to pay around £ 0 to deliver elsewhere but why should i pay £ 0 when i don_'_t know what the parcel is or even who it '_s from ?
negative	( it could just be some junkmail maybe )
negative	i don_'_t think parcelforce have any idea about customer service - they seem to deliver only to people who are at home weekdays .
negative	i would never choose to use parcelforce unless they buck up their ideas and get real !
negative	i believe their adv .
negative	about fast delivery .
negative	0 days still_awaiting delivery .
negative	i contacted customer service 0 times as going away , very poor and useless .
negative	got a mail from cg as i '_ve bought musical_equipment in the past .
negative	trolled through the " so called " sale offers - mainly 0nd_hand stuff that was almost full price with amazing 00_%_off !!
negative	!
negative	but managed to happen upon a yamaha guitar that would sell on ebay for around £_000 going for £_00 plus £_00 post .
negative	bought it and paid straight_away and received a mail to say it had been posted .
negative	hurray !
negative	then a couple of days_later another mail to say it was damaged beyond_repair in transit and they refunded my money !
negative	i mean ... how would they know ?
negative	all rather curious but the bottom_line is don_'_t even waste your time with these_people , i won_'_t be .
negative	ryanair what a joke only travelled with them once bought newspapers at the airport in a carrier_bag from newsagents stopped at doors as we had too many bags !!!!
negative	i said we have bought these here and the man said throw the bag away and carry them on board i would rather swim than travel with them again as the whole_experience was dispiriting
negative	despite already complaining and being promised a follow_up , national_tyres and autocare have still not produced any paperwork to show they actually did anything .
negative	i will never use them again and have no faith any work was carried_out
negative	ordered some things from amazon and thought i ' d check on the delivery tracking .
negative	after_seeing my package take 0 days to get from wednesbury to reading i thought i ' d check out some online reviews .
negative	seems they '_ve got quite a reputation .
negative	i '_m not getting involved with discussions them , i '_m kicking it back to amazon .
negative	distance_selling consumer_rights say that you ' re not liable for anything until it '_s delivered to you and it '_s up to the seller to make_sure you get what you '_ve paid for and not up to you to chase delivery companies .
negative	plus unless enough people complain to amazon about yodel , they might even be unaware of the problem .
negative	i still_haven_'_t had my stuff by the way .
negative	it '_s been in reading for 0 days .
negative	doing what , i '_ve got no idea .....
negative	arrived at depot ( reading service centre ) 00th_dec_0000 00 : 00
negative	departed depot ( wednesbury hub ) 00th_dec_0000 00 : 00

negative	i had a dispute that ran for months regarding someone_who bought something from me then mistakenly charged back when they didn_'_t recognise the purchase on their credit_card statement .
negative	paypal is okay when you don_'_t have an issue , but when the time comes that you do , you will witness what a horrible company it really is .
negative	don_'_t take my word for it , there are thousands of victims of chargeback fraud telling their stories online and websites dedicated to exposing paypal .
negative	arrogant , mealy - mouthed customer service ( call_centre ).
negative	hollow promises about how they are ' on the seller '_s side '.
negative	frustrating bureaucracy and automated customer service that can '_t answer your problem .
negative	i will do everything i can to avoid using paypal ever in my life .
negative	web_site great .
negative	delivery via yodel probably the poorest i have ever_experienced , still not arrived after a week and the party is in 0_weeks !
negative	you have some kind of dodge where you pay no vat .
negative	i will not be using you again .
negative	the carrier lost my parcel even_though i received an e_- mail saying it would be delivered .
negative	had to e_- mail the carrier twice , then phoned customer_services whose attitude and response i was not impressed with .
negative	said i would get a refund at some point in the future when they had followed all their procedures to find the parcel and determined that a refund was due .
negative	not what i expect from a moden internet company .
negative	worst internet_shopping_experience i have had .
negative	bought wifi for 00_hours and only got an_hour usage due to he wifi going down in just my room .
negative	went to reception and they put me through to internet provider , got it fixed but when i went up to the room again , wifi lost signal again , spent half the night in reception trying to fix it .
negative	second night there was noise in the halls and noise from car_park / streets , therefore that was another night with hardly_any sleep .
negative	only stayed there 0 nights .
negative	also tried_contacting customer_services and when i eventually got through to them they were no help at all .
negative	if you are staying in glasgow i would not recommend premier_inn .
negative	not received the trophies
negative	order was made late november and subsequent email to the company requesting a proposed alteration has remained unanswered - still_haven_'_t received the order even_tho delivery date of dec 00 was stated on order - quite a sentimental xmas_present ruined - just hope it turns_up at some point in new year
negative	this has to be the poorest delivery company to grace this planet .
negative	i ordered an item on 00th_december and got an email to say it would be delivered to me on the 00th_december .
negative	i checked the tracking on the 00th and it had not even reached their delivery depot which was only 00 miles from their hub .
negative	i live 00 miles from the company who sent me the item .
negative	i called dpd and they said it would not be delivered until tuesday 0rd_jan no reason given .
negative	tuesday came and went with still no delivery , ok it was stormy that day so i could forgive them for that as many of the bridges were closed .
negative	however , no information sent to me whatsoever about the delivery it finally arrived wednesday at 0 : 00 pm .
negative	is it no wonder this country is going down the pan when we have to deal with incompetent companies like that .
negative	god help us .
negative	whatever you do dont use this lot
negative	i bought a 00ft_trampoline in good faith having read about the quality of the product .
negative	it seemed to do just that , you know work properly , until the first of many springs started to snap ( top quality ). the first time i spoke to the company about the broken spring they sent me 0 ( yes 0 ) in the post . now more have started to snap i spoke again and was told i would not get a refund because of the warranty , which only covers the parts and not the whole trampoloine ( confused you will be ). so what makes up the trampoline ? i guess you could say that springs are a major part of it and if they are a bad quality then the rest wont be much_better . i am waitng to hear about a full_refund ( watch this space )
negative	oh_yeah it is only 0 months old
negative	trustpilot a blatently allowing the online_homebrew company to abuse this service and mislead customers .
negative	this renders trustpilot completely pointless .
negative	i placed my order for a few beer_kits and a fermenting barrel with a tap on the 00th_september .
negative	at that time one of the kits was out of stock , due in on the 0th_october .
negative	this was acceptable and i proceded .
negative	over the next four weeks all the items in my order were in and out of stock and nothing was recieved .
negative	despite my communication requesting the change of an item to one in stock , nothing was sent .
negative	other communications made took 0 and 0 days to be responded to to try and find out what was going on .
negative	after over four weeks ( 00 / 00 ) i recieved half my order which included the fermenting barrel but with no tap and a note saying the tap would follow .
negative	nearly another week past and i recieved the rest of my order , still no tap .
negative	today over 0_weeks_later ( 00 / 00 ) i have still not recieved the tap despite_being assured that four have now been sent .
negative	i have no_problems with any post from any other company .
negative	i requested a refund via post around two_weeks_ago and was told one last attempt would be made to ship a tap .
negative	still nothing .
negative	i again have requested a refund which i am not confident of recieving .
negative	terrible delivery .
negative	terrible customer service .
negative	terrible communication .
negative	i should have known not to trust a company with no phone contact .
negative	i will be taking my custom to my local homebrew shop from now on .
negative	it '_s more_expensive but at_least i wont encounter the problems mentioned and will actually recieve what i have paid for .
negative	update ( 00 / 00 ): still no tap recieved as expected .
negative	still no refund recieved .
negative	only response when trying to contact them is that my refund request ' has_been passed to the appropriate person '.
negative	i have had this response twice .
negative	how long can it possibly take to process a refund ??
negative	absolutely pathetic service .
negative	update ( 00 / 00 ): still no refund .
negative	still no response other than ' your request has_been passed_onto the appropriate person '.
negative	00 weeks tomorrow since i placed my order .
negative	i ordered door_handles online for a refurbishment project .
negative	they were listed as available for next_day delivery and it was essential for me to have them within 0 days in order to meet a contract deadline .
negative	before ordering i called the store to check_availability and was assured that these were stock and would be with me in time .
negative	i placed the order online and added a note to the order reiterating the importance of delivery within 0 days and requesting that if this were not possible i should be contacted immediately .
negative	seven_days_later the items had not been delivered .
negative	i called the store and was advised that a 0 week lead time was required because the items are made to order .
negative	they had meant to call to advise me but the person responsible for making the call seemed to have forgotten and was away .
negative	i explained that due to the importance of the deadline i had called to ensure availability and all they could say was - yeah , that '_s rubbish , isn_'_t it .
negative	i was offered three options : wait 0_weeks , or a refund or buy something else .
negative	no discounts , nothing .
negative	i took the refund and won_'_t be back .
negative	on top of this - one week_later the refund had not been sent and had to be sought by opening a paypal_dispute .
negative	only then was it sent .
negative	rubbish service from beginning to end .
negative	ordered a laser tape_measure on 00 oct . on 00 oct i phoned for a refund as the web_site still says my item has not been fullfilled .
negative	minimum wait time is 00_minutes on the phone .
negative	there is no way to cancel an order online so phone is the only way .
negative	wae cannot tell me when the refund will be processed .
negative	" as soon as possible " the lady said - and that is all she could tell me .
negative	a good company would have sent an email to unfullfilled customers warning them of any delays .
negative	i don_'_t know if something more sinister is occuring with this company but it only appears interested in hanging onto the money as long as possible .
negative	we ordered a playmobile set for christmas on 0st dec which there website claimed was in stock .
negative	after two_weeks we called the company and they said it was in germany and would arrive on 00 dec which is days ago .
negative	on another site i ordered 0 products from germany and they all arrived within 0 days .
negative	so clearly this is nothing to do with postage time .
negative	we called the company and a rude person answered and said to be patient .
negative	clearly the order will never arrive and i will complain to the oft so that they can eventually shut these_cowboys down .
negative	i '_ll get my money back from visa .
negative	please do not fall_into the same trap .
negative	this company is a scam and there are plently of highly_rated companies that you can buy from instead . good luck .
negative	i placed this order with you on the basis that you delivered on 00th_march .
negative	this was particular ; y important as we had a family wedding and birthday with everybody staying at a castle we had hired in scotland for the weekend .
negative	the sunday delivery was important as ( a ) the wedding was saturday so no disturbances with deliveries were wanted ( b ) sunday was the actual birthday and off course mothers_day , and ( c ) we were all leaving monday so nobody would be there .
negative	i tried other florists but you were the only ones offering a sunday delivery .
negative	that is the reason i placed the order with you .
negative	i got a standard your delivery has_been allocated message_stating 00th_march delivery .
negative	i complained and subsequently got a further standard your despatch has_been allocated email_stating delivery was sunday .
negative	happy days !
negative	!
negative	to my amazement the first half of the order , the mothers_day order , was then delivered on the saturday during our_wedding ….
negative	not good !
negative	!
negative	worse , but not a surprise any more , the second half of the delivery , the birthday order , never arrived on the saturday or the sunday .
negative	we all left early monday_morning .
negative	i did get a standard successful delivery confirmation on the 00st , after we had left so i assume the second half of the delivery was delivered date the day after we left .
negative	so a disturbed wedding , a disappointing mothers_day and an unhappy birthday .
negative	very very poor customer service .
negative	i ordered 00 yellow_roses for my fiancee as it was our_anniversary but what i got to what i thought i paid for were to totally different things , i have brought up a complaint with your customer_services .
negative	i inherited this company as a utility provider when moving in to a new house .
negative	it is undoubtedly the worst customer service company i have ever had the misfortune of dealing_with .
negative	bills are inaccurate and then it is impossible to get them on the phone , e_- mails go_unanswered and when you do get hold of them , their promises to resolve things never actually happen .
negative	you will however receive plenty of threatening_letters and phone_calls demanding payment for inaccurate bills .
negative	they may be slightly_cheaper but the gain is really not worth the hassle .
negative	ryanaiir '_s motto is ' cheapest airline ' and that '_s all it is really .
negative	they have managed to remove any civility or enjoyment from flying in my opinion .
negative	i am obliged to use them for business , but i will no_longer use them for private use .
negative	in my opinion they finally have mangaged to make the whole exerience uncomportable , from booking on line with all the £ extras , restricting hold_baggage to 00kg and insisting on their cabin_crew selling cheap features and offers in flight !
negative	ryanair .... re - think please !
negative	they don_'_t call when they say , they don_'_t ring the bell - just stick a card through the door .
negative	i have attempted four deliveries this week and had a friend stay at my flat during the hour_window in which delivery was promised but they didn_'_t turn_up .
negative	now without a delivery card i can '_t even collect it from the depo .
negative	nobody ever answers their phones .
negative	if they have such a poor customer service record why do any companies use them ?????
negative	?
negative	first attempt at delivery on saturday , they didn_'_t bother to ring the bell - just chucked one of their ' sorry we missed you ' cards into the shared letterbox outside the front_door .
negative	when i found that later i eventually located a depot phone number so i could collect it myself but they said no - the item was on the van and they were closing in 00_minutes .
negative	they therefore helpfully offered to redeliver it on monday when i was at work 00 miles_away .
negative	i phoned orange ( who employed dpd for some unknown_reason ) and they agreed to send my new iphone to my work address for monday and emailed their dpd contact to arrange the consignment .
negative	dpd tried to deliver it to my home again on monday then read the email changing the destination and said they would deliver it today .
negative	today arrives and i thought it best to check with orange at about 00 . 00 .
negative	today dpd say they only received the change of address today and will be delivering it tomorrow .
negative	a likely story - i '_ll believe it when i see it .
negative	added to which their website is chronic , charges are ridiculous , customer service is non_existent , and how they can claim to be a delivery company when they don_'_t deliver is beyond me .
negative	took_ages for delivery and it was only until i emailed that i was told that the item was out of stock and would be delivered when available .
negative	not the best ....
negative	first time i bought had problem money taken no order showing , but was sorted_out quickly , second time i bought advertised items but could not deliver in over a month had no feedback poor communication , people could not even talk to me in english really a poor service . am dissapointed as after first order was fixed promoted the company , but now i cannot recomend this company and wont be buying again as this company cost me plenty in money on international phone_calls what i would of saved on the items i ordered cost me more on trying to follow_up and eventually cancell my order .
negative	one person got rude with my email after i had emailed about 0 times to see what is happening with my order .
negative	ordered two solo sprayers 0_weeks_ago , delivery came - 0 new sprayer and 0 used one of a different model from that ordered .
negative	they don_'_t answer emails so i '_ve since repeatedly chased them on the phone and have had various different answers everytime i '_ve spoken to someone including being told that another sprayer would be sent out as a complimentary gesture from solo - which abbey have since reneged on .
negative	the sprayer was for a worker so i '_ve had to purchase another one from a different dealership , which interestingly enough was delivered within 0 days !
negative	seemingly i '_m getting my replacement sprayer from abbey next week , i '_ll believe it when i see it .
negative	i '_ve seldom come_across such incompetence and definitely could not recommend them .
negative	i have not received the goods
negative	i bought a pretty comprehensive 00 - month international travel_insurance_policy from multitrip for my wife and i a year_ago .
negative	some danish sport aviation colleagues invited us to judge their national championships , but then i got a deeply incapacitating cough and at the very last we just had to abandon the trip .
negative	i sought_advice from my doctor , who confidently provided the required medical reasoning document multitrip required ( for £_00 ...) and thus i expected at_least a helpful response .
negative	not a chance - what followed was a series of prevaricating dodges , on paper and by telephone , that ultimately led to stalemate .
negative	it wasn_'_t much money , but it was distasteful and all trust is gone .
negative	then - to my astonishment - multitrip renewed the policy two_weeks ahead of the due date ( whilst we were many miles_away on a hard - to - communicate trip ) and i had to respond quite forcefully to retrieve the money already taken from my bank_account .
negative	never again !
negative	according to mazuma my fone was blacklisted just took it into vodafone and they checked on the national database and they said phone is not blacklisted and gave_me more than i was offered by mazuma for a non - working samsung_jet .
negative	i will never use this website again !
negative	stay_away from these !
negative	i ordered a jacket from their website on a sunday , they said it would arrive with me on the following friday in time for my camping_trip .
negative	the jacket i received on the friday was completely the wrong jacket ( a woman '_s , small jacket - i am a man ).
negative	when i rang up they offered me another jacket with a different brand which i did not want so they offered me a refund but only when they collected the woman '_s jacket .
negative	i managed to find this jacket else where , but as a result of the late refund , couldn_'_t buy it as i didn_'_t have the money .
negative	ellis_brigham could have refunded me there and then and i wouldn_'_t have suffered on my trip .
negative	awful company .
negative	awful staff .
negative	stay_away from these , they are not worthy of your money
negative	would not recommend , service appalling received less money but this was not the issue no warning of this was .
negative	easy to book , would have been nice to be able to find more out , such as what type of oil_filter is used , or a better time than just morning or afternoon so will have to wait and see how it all goes before i can say just how good it is .
negative	well after being told they didnt really want to do the job - trying to charge £_00 for undoin a few screws to remove the undertray they still managed to cock it up .
negative	broken shoulder to air intake and left clips off .
negative	big_mistake - avoid in future .
negative	well it seems like a respectable company that has hit the big time has finally stopped being customer lead and the money machine firmly kicks in by not giving a damn about the customer .
negative	we are talking_about failure to deliver the goods on time .
negative	two orders placed in as many weeks .
negative	both failed to be delivered on time and end up arriving late by up to 0 days .
negative	the excuses , a glitch in the stock system is their explanation .
negative	i am still_waiting for the second order !
negative	on both_occasions their system flagged items out of stock .
negative	notified after closing time by text_message , so there '_s nothing can be done for the same day despatch as they sell it , and charge for it - nothing cheap about delivery costs here !
negative	when you do get contact from them , they deny the items were out of stock and then let you know they will despatch .
negative	the second order was delayed 0 days before despatch as their system flagged 0 out of stock items , then they advise they weren_'_t out of stock , but yet still delayed .
negative	i suspect the items were out of stock but they won_'_t admit a flaw in their ' live ' online stock system .
negative	if you order more than a couple of items , expect problems .
negative	they never used to be like this , buyers_beware !

negative	ordered a nexus_0 tablet which was stated to be in stock on their web - site on dec 0st .
negative	delivery promised within 0 to 0 ' working_days '.
negative	no delivery so asked for refund which was granted on dec_00th .
negative	refund did not arrive until 00st_january .
negative	using their contact system resulted_in bland responses and lots of promises then followed_by a request to rate their services !
negative	despite several responses that my refund was being treated with highest priority etc i eventually contacted a ' supervisor ' who explained the 00 day delay in getting my refund was due to them being ' surprised ' at the volume of orders over christmas .
negative	i cannot under any circumstances recommend this company .
negative	needless to say the company did not contact me after this review .
negative	the cartridge sent didn_'_t work .
negative	i sent email which wasn_'_t responded to .
negative	will not be using company again .
negative	glasses were delivered in within timescales however once opened they were damaged .
negative	called to arrange replacement to find out that we would have to pay the cost of postage and packing !!!!
negative	so if wanted a replacement or refund it cost me money due to the companies mishandling !
negative	would never use this shocking service again
negative	i ordered 0 dining_chairs from macandmac .
negative	they looked to be good quality at a reasonable price .
negative	iwas prepared to wait for some time but after 00 weeks i was fed_up , especially as macandmac had not offered any explanation for such a long wait .
negative	a phone_call resulted_in a specific date by which delivery would be made .
negative	it passed with no sign of the chairs .
negative	an irate e_- mail produced a promise of an_urgent investigation and and a response within a day or so .
negative	nothing , of course , and i am still_waiting .
negative	my next move is to demand the return of my money .
negative	i will never use this company again .
negative	.
negative	i sent 0 emails to customer service on mon . 0th_june .
negative	auto response said they would be answered within_00hours .
negative	on thurs .
negative	00th_june still_awaiting a response .
negative	i phoned customer service on mon . 0th_june , my details were taken and i was told they would call back with an answer .
negative	thurs .
negative	00th_june still no call back .
negative	this is the very worst customer service i can recall for a very long time .
negative	products may be good but no back up service will not help this company .
negative	really not happy with pet_supermarket service .
negative	told in my first email it would be delivered in 0 - 0 working_days that was on the 00 / 00 /_0000 @ 00 : 00 am .
negative	and still no delivery 00 / 00 /_0000 @ 00 : 00 am .
negative	will not be using it ever again .
negative	as been disabled its hard to be here to get deliveries . still no delivery , now 00 / 00 /_0000 @ 00 . 00_hrs . well now 00 / 00 /_0000 and still no delivery , i '_m getting my payment refunded in 0 to 0 working_days but they get it out of the bank in two_days , i ; m just waiting now to see if it goes into my account by the 00 / 00 /_0000 . well got the refund in my account today 00 / 00 /_0000 . but i still won_'_t use pet - supermarket ever again , plus my friends said they won_'_t either . well still no delivery of my goods as told earlier there was no tracking for my goods if it had been posted it should still arrive at sometime , but told pet - supermarket if it does arrive i will return it to them 00 / 00 /_0000 . still no delivery , but got the refund on 00 / 00 /_0000 .
negative	this now over 0 month since the order was placed , this will be my last update until the goods arrive ??.
negative	then i will let you know i have returned the item but still think it has not been sent . 00 / 00 /_0000 .
negative	eyewear customer service excellence .
negative	courier experience awful .
negative	had to re - arrange collectio from depot .
negative	shockingly treated by whilst trying to collect .
negative	never again ..
negative	i thought i was doing a shrewd bit of business by not going to specsavers but how wrong i was .
negative	the glassess i ordered were fine but to be honest november order beginning of feb delivery was rubbish .
negative	i originally chased up my ordfer after waiting the required time and then asked if i could have a refund .
negative	i was told that selectspecs have no responsibility once the hong_kong order has_been shipped so no way hose for a refund .
negative	i found the attitude disgraceful and to be honest i saved a fiver and wished i had never bothered .
negative	would not recoment selectspecs to anybody .
negative	still_waiting for item 0 month of placing my order for an item that was shown as in stock .
negative	promote their buyers and sack their operations director
negative	ordered item on 00 / 0 / 00 and received it on 00 / 0 / 00 at which point i no_longer needed it .
negative	chemist_direct now refuse to refund my order and are ignoring my emails .
negative	i will never trust chemist_direct again !
negative	ordered 0 blinds from this company .
negative	when blinds arrived on the friday one of them was sent with the wrong brackets .
negative	called them immediately on monday_morning and after the usual waiting for 00_minutes in a queue to be answered got someone to send out the correct brackets .
negative	was told they would be with me next_day delivery .
negative	on tuesday didn_'_t receive anything and called them again to be told they would send a 0rd set out which to me sounded_like they hadn_'_t sent them in the first place .
negative	on thursday brackets arrived but to my amazement they had sent exactly the same brackets again !!
negative	called them again on friday and again waiting for an_eternity to be answered eventually got someone again to send out replacements .
negative	asked if they could send them out next_day delivery to be told someone would call me to verify that it would be next_day delivery .
negative	it was now 0pm and i called them again for an update to be told that no - one called me back as they were too_busy answering calls for orders .
negative	i was told it would be too expensive so it would need to be monday . they arrived following_monday .
negative	shocking after sales service !... since using them have read numerous bad_experiences with them on review sites .
negative	don_'_t go near !
negative	!
negative	the company sell aftermarket product in my opinion , 0 of my items had marks , 0 had a hole in it as if they were seconds , they replaced the items in question but no apology .
negative	getthelabel had my review here removed because i could not find my proof of purchase .
negative	found my receipt now !
negative	asda price guarantee , what a joke !
negative	since i started_using the self check out most of the things on offer when i scan the items are different to the shelf price therefore no offer .
negative	i called them over time after time and they make me wait to check the price to see if i '_m lying and they always return and apologise .
negative	one of the staff_members laughed and said " i wonder_how many other people we have ripped_off today !"
negative	this happened to me again today with item showing offer of £ 0 and when i got to the till , it was £ 0 . 00 !
negative	i just told them , to put them back as i '_m sick of asda ripping me off with fake offers .
negative	she said nothing and walked_away .
negative	what makes me so angry is if i had not started_using the self checkout service i would have never noticed that the items i bought on offer were not on offer at all .
negative	when my contract ran_out i phoned bt and asked for a mac_code to leave and the sales_person tried to make me a rubbish offer , he was coming out with a load of bull in the hope i would not know anything about bt .
negative	i challenged him as he clearly thought he could pull the wool over my eyes .
negative	he then just started auguring with me as i would not renew with them as he could not to a better deal .
negative	kind of shocked about this approach because i '_m the customer .
negative	i did not renew at this time and put the phone down .
negative	an_hour later i got a text_message from bt saying , give us a call , we can beat that offer .
negative	i phoned them and they could not beat the offer i had but then they gave in and made it a little cheaper , so i stayed !!
negative	i regret this now !!
negative	!
negative	while i was on the phone with them , the deal done !
negative	they asked me if i wanted to add bt_vision , i said " no , i am trying to save_money , not add it !"
negative	he replied " fair_enough "
negative	then i got my contract , not as we disgust , so i phoned bt and complained , she sorted it out and said " i see you ordered bt_vision as well !"
negative	grrr i said " no " told_him , i not want it and this is fraud , i want to make a complaint about this to which she replied " ok , i will send you now , your updated contract and asked me for the sales mans name who i dealt_with and someone will contact me regarding this !
negative	i gave his details , shock_horror gasp !
negative	i never received my updated contract , or an email regarding my complaint .
negative	i just left it as i checked my bill and she had corrected it , and i did not want anymore hassle !
negative	everything was fine for a few_months until now !!
negative	i pay 00 months line rental saver and i received my bill today and they have now charged me again for my line rental , so to date i have been charged_twice for my line rental !
negative	!
negative	never again !!!!
negative	bt very poor service !

negative	never again !!!!
negative	bt very poor service !
negative	!
negative	customer_services are very bad !
negative	over a year_ago i contacted them regarding my renewal_quote , asked them to do better as it had gone up from the year before by £_000 even_though i have no points on my licence and never made a claim while with them .
negative	they did not give a stuff and told me to go online if i think i can do better !
negative	i just insured with them as i had no insurance on my car and needed to go out in it , otherwise i would have taken their advice , clearly they do not want to keep their safe driving customers .
negative	my cover is now up again soon and just before it was due , esure contacted me saying due to their policy they have removed my legal cover and i am not entitled to a hire car if i now make a claim , if i want this included again i will have to pay extra !
negative	i told customer_services i am trying to save_money , not add it , and it should be against the law for them to change my policy after i had agreed to it but its in the small_print , they can do as they want once you sign up with them , a bit like the mobile_phone companies changing your fixed rate monthly_contract !
negative	my insurance is due now so i phoned them to renew , i ask them to do better with the quote they sent me , they refused to look and told me to go online at esure and i may get it cheaper , then i asked them to put me through to the retention department otherwise i will leave them for good , they would not put me through to them and just told me they can deal with this , then informed me that i have not been covered for the last 0 years with them because my full name is not on the policy , i said " you are a joke , just a scam not to pay out if i needed to make a claim !, and why has no one informed me of this problem before !
negative	reply from customer service " it is in my policy small_print , you should have read it "
negative	i told them you are now making me want to leave you for good now , she said " ok bye "
negative	shock , horror , gasp !
negative	they are at number 00 in the which report 00_% , how the hell they even did that i do not know !
negative	should not have even made it on the list !
negative	liverpool victoria was number 0 on the list in which , i contacted them and i got it for £ 0 . 00p cheaper_than esure and it includes hire car and legal cost at no extra_cost !
negative	so i will see how it goes with lv !!
negative	got to be better_than esure , as they don_'_t even give a s *** that i have left after 0 years with them !
negative	!
negative	i have spoken to customer_services as neither of my parcels sent to russia arrived .
negative	i paid for international sign for , at an extra_cost for peace of mind but after 0_weeks still nothing !
negative	the website says it takes 00 days to moscow and customer_services have told me that once it leaves the uk there is nothing they can do to find my parcel and i have to contact the russian postal service myself .
negative	what a joke , i paid for international sign for , and they cannot find my parcel , you have to sign to collect it and i have a tracking_number but customer_services said there is no way of finding out where my parcels are !
negative	!
negative	what '_s the point in buying international sign for if you can not find out where my parcels are and can not find out who has signed for it , if anyone !
negative	!
negative	the post_office counter even told me to pay extra for peace of mind as it needs to be signed for otherwise it '_s returned to myself !
negative	hmm still_waiting !

negative	update_: parcel turned_up 0 months later !
negative	better late than never i guess !
negative	been with the rac for over 0 years and not used them for a long time , used them twice overall .
negative	myself , father and sister are all on full cover .
negative	my sister was driving her car and hit the kerb which gave her a flat tyre at night and she could not get the wheel off to replace , as it was on a busy_road at night and a lone female who was in a panic and crying .
negative	she contacted myself and her father to tell us that the rac have refused to come out as it is classed_as an accident and not a breakdown .
negative	they put her in touch with their partners ( quindell motors ) who now work with the rac regarding crashes , these also refused to help .
negative	i contacted the rac and they said we did not have full cover , only my father did , even_though we all have cards showing full cover since_0000 .
negative	i got angry with customer_services and they put me on hold and once they returned we all were covered and they could not explain_why they left my sister in the middle of nowhere and refusing to help !
negative	then they put me on hold again , and said it is because she had a accident to which i replied " rubbish , you are a joke ! "
negative	they said it is classed_as a crash so their policy states not allowed help as its not a breakdown !
negative	hmm if the car gets a flat tyre and cannot move it ,, id class it as a breakdown !
negative	i have told them that i will be closing my account for good and complaining to watchdog about their so called policy and asked to close my account right this instant !
negative	!
negative	the reply was they cannot log a complaint or close my account as the customer_services is now closed , as this is the breakdown service .
negative	the rac say its not their fault the way my sister was treated over the phone because it was their partners ( quindell motors ) manager she spoke to and not the breakdown manager she had spoken to that night .
negative	rac pass you onto these muppets if there is a crash and a blame !!
negative	( quindell motors 0 year contract with rac )
negative	there was no crash !!!!!!!!!
negative	!
negative	anyway , i will now leave them and go_elsewhere as it was dangerous to leave a lone female at night on a busy_road and just bull *** her about policy to avoid any form of help !
negative	!
negative	addison lee and carlyle , which owns breakdown firm rac and health_food chain holland and barratt , so i will not be shopping there either anymore !
negative	the second item for a penny is bull as well , be warned !
negative	check out the prices !
negative	i have been taking my car to victoriagarage . co . uk ( ford ) for many_years to have my car serviced .
negative	never again !!
negative	!
negative	i went to look at buying a polo from here and the sales staff was very friendly and he said i could have the car for 0 , 000 including 00months mot , a full service , 0 months tax included if i buy the car .
negative	i pointed_out the problems i had found with the car , ie , exhaust need replacing and wing_mirror damaged .
negative	he refused to replace the exhaust unless it fails its mot .
negative	so i said i will think about it and walked_away .
negative	my daughter went back to test_drive the polo as she was going to buy it if the test_drive went well .
negative	she was not expecting the abuse she got when trying to sort_out the deal , the person she spoken to was not there and according to this vile and aggressive person , he is the boss !!
negative	she explained the deal to him and he became very aggressive and said the deal did not include 0 months tax , !!
negative	he flipped out as if we were telling_lies .
negative	my daughter told_him the deal was not done with him and he said in his aggressive manner he is the boss and did not say this over the phone with his sales staff !!!
negative	not my daughters problem !!
negative	and clearly this guy does not know how to deal with his customers , hence no sale and as my son is a police officer in leigh he will pass word around through word of mouth , as voting with your feet and informing everyone to avoid this vile company !
negative	!
negative	as you can expect , i will never be returning my vehicle for a full service as i have been doing for a very long time , if i had dealt_with this person at fords before i would have ditched this company alot sooner .
negative	i will be contacting them to get then to remove me from the mailing_list as they usually_write to me reminding_me regarding my service , not wanted any longer !
negative	he has no right to speak to my daughter like this , silly man when she had 0 , 000 in her pocket !!
negative	and he has no right to speak to any customer like this or any other human_being for that matter !
negative	!
negative	be warned !!
negative	! disgusting vile management !!
negative	!
negative	i was contacted by boots to tell me my parcel would be delivered on 00th_jan_0000 .
negative	i waited all day and night , nothing !
negative	!
negative	i contacted boots and told them to refund me as i '_m not waiting for hermes any longer .
negative	boots contacted hermes on 00th_jan_0000 telling them to return the item back to them .
negative	at 00 : 00 the same day hermes tried to deliver my parcel even after they have been told not to .
negative	i was not in and they have said on the tracking infomation they will try and delivery to me again tomorrow .
negative	does anyone listen at hermes .
negative	they missed the dead line and i can not wait in another 00_hours for a no show .
negative	boots are damaging their reputation using these muppets .
negative	00 / 00 / 00 updated - hermes are now claiming that they tried to deliver my item a third time at the last time was 00 : 00 , i was in until 00 : 00 , no doorbell_rang , no card left any of these soooo called 0 delivery attempts !!
negative	i was in 0 out of the 0 times they claim to have been around to my address !!
negative	lies !!
negative	avoid !
negative	!
negative	sent a parcel via_parcelforce global express on 00th_december_0000 , suppose to deliver via_fedex in moscow .
negative	my parcel was passed_onto fedex in moscow on 00th_december_0000 according to parcelforce and they told me to phone fedex quoting my tracking_number to them .
negative	i phoned fedex and it took 00min 00seconds on hold to get through to their customer_services who stated used the ref given and could not find my parcel , then they asked for the address i had sent my item too .
negative	customer_services then fobbed me off saying they can not find my parcel using parcelforces tracking_number and they need a reference_number which they gave parcelfoce when collected by them from moscow .
negative	i contacted parcelforce for the fourth time regarding this situation and they have told me they do not have a ref / tracking_number from fedex and in all the years she been working within customer_services they just use the same tracking_number with was given to me from day one .
negative	so to date , i have paid on the 00th_december £_00 . 00 for a 0kg parcel to be delivered in russia within the deadline of 0 days and still nothing , no parcel , neither parcelforce / fedex want to help or can give me any infomation to why my item has still not been delivered on time and has now taken over 00days and still not arrived at its_destination !!
negative	!
negative	parcelfarce / fedex useless !!!
negative	once they have your money , they do not care or bother to help you find your parcel in any way !!
negative	!
negative	update - 00th_dec_0000 , item still not delivered and parcelforce said they would look into the matter and phone me back , still not contacted me !
negative	update - parcel delivered after parceforce contacted fedex to find out they had only written half of the russia address on their fedex delivery form and stuck this over the full address i had given them in english and in russian .
negative	then parceforce contacted me with a ref_number and asked me to contact my russia friend to contact fedex russia to make_sure it gets delivered .
negative	my friend contacted them and omg , they delivered the parcel on 0th_january_0000 !
negative	!
negative	00th_december_0000 - 0 january , express service , what a joke !
negative	not delivered !!!
negative	!
negative	every time i have used this company there has_been a problem .
negative	0st time i ordered 0 things .
negative	0 days_later i had not received anything .
negative	i had to ring up and contact them to find 0 of the 0 things were out of stock .
negative	so i said they could send the one product they did have .
negative	they then send me the wrong product .
negative	i then had to return it before waiting for them to send the right product .
negative	they offered my 0 %_off my next order .
negative	when i tried to use this , the code they gave did did not work .
negative	says everything .
negative	i was then stupid enough to order yet again from them .
negative	0 days_later , no email of the product being sent out , and 00 attempts at calling them have gone_unanswered .
negative	avoid !!
negative	!
negative	the biggest problem is that sagepay use elavon .
negative	you only have to search for , ' elavon complaints ' in google to find out how bad they are .
negative	sagepay have a relationship with elavon in that sagepay is the payment gateway and elavon do the bit that puts the money into your bank_account .
negative	we have wasted six_months of our_lives trying to get an account opened and working and finally we thought we were there , but suddenly elavon stopped the money reaching our account , so we are left with no cashflow .
negative	it '_s been a month and still no cashflow .
negative	we phone up sagepay and all they can do is send an email to elavon .
negative	how pathetic is that ?
negative	also you phone up elavon and get told you will get a phone_call back with an answer , but you never will and you will waste even more time phoning them back to hear the same thing again and again .
negative	verdict_: if you value your time , then don_'_t use sagepay and elavon and certainly don_'_t believe the sales people or their website that says it '_s a quick and easy process .
negative	i think mattressman has an excellent website , range and customer service .
negative	however , their delivery company nightfreight is utterly and forced me to cancel my order .
negative	friday delivery did not arrive , but i had a voicemail from their office at 0000 .
negative	when i called back i was told there should be a calling_card but there wasn_'_t , but after a bit of pressure they agreed to redeliver on saturday before 000am .
negative	it didn_'_t arrive i called nightfreight , who said it was scheduled for monday before 000am .
negative	it arrived on monday at st 0000 but i had already canceled it .
negative	dirty run down smelly homeless hostel .
negative	nothing like brochures or booking sites .
negative	absolutly disgusting my dog kennel is cleaner .
negative	no stars , for a truly ' diabolical ' ' service ' ???
negative	no service at all really .. despite saying no to a 0am delivery in the first instance , told on 0 further occasions that that would be the delivery time .
negative	this was by the ' delivery company ' used ( yodel ) who were truly atrocious .
negative	they did turn_up at 00 . 00 one morning , blocking my cul - de - sac , and , after a twenty minute ' perusal ' of paperwork , and a search of the van , told me they did not have ' my product ' ( a washing_machine ! )
negative	on their van !
negative	went back to k & co , and complained .. they said they would ' sort it out ', and asked ' when ' we would like it delivered .. we said " anytime after 00am , any day of the week " .. it turned_up , a couple of days_later , @ 00 . 00 !
negative	.. at_least they did have the washing_machine this time , and , luckily , we were in to take delivery !!
negative	.. on 0 separate_occasions ' after ' taking this delivery , we were rang up by
negative	yodel , to say that they were going to deliver it ' 0 days hence ' from the phone_call !!!
negative	...
negative	truly unbelievable , and atrocious , ' so
negative	called ' service ...
negative	absolutely_appalling ...
negative	innertubes missing from my order and no responses from wiggle .
negative	will never shop there again !!!
negative	!
negative	just to start off , i only selected 0_star because you had to choose , otherwise it would be - 00 ..
negative	if only i would of read_reviews of talktalk before i decided to go into a contract with them .
negative	originally joined them about 0 and a half years_ago with just internet and phone at my old address , while with them it was fine , the bill was never what we agreed to pay but we guessed it '_s probably like that with most companies .
negative	we recently decided to move house and when i contacted talktalk i realised they had forget to mention to me that the 0 year contract was up 0 months previous but they had put me on a rolling_contract .
negative	after i rang them i told the guy on the phone that i actually was going to move to sky as we wanted the tv_channels etc .
negative	i was told that the talktalk box was as good as sky and that i could get the sky channels for a little extra each_month , i was also promised hundreds of on demand movies and the ability to pause and rewind live tv , after waiting 0_weeks to get the package confirmed because twice talktalk had made mistakes while ordering the equipment etc ( should have know then ) i told them to cancel the contract i had decided to leave but they promised it would be easier if i stayed with them instead of having to move from one to the other .
negative	when we moved and received the talktalk box i realised i had been swindled ..
negative	the channels took about 0 / 00 seconds to change on a good day .. but most of the time would take about 0 - 0 minutes to change occasionally crashing and having to be completely restarted !
negative	as well as this you could only record the talktalk channels and not the usual digital channels , each months bill was massively over priced what we expected and if you paused something and came back an_hour later it would just skip back to the live playing .
negative	i contacted talktalk after 0 months of this poop and they where completely cooperative saying they understand it was their mistake , they will cancel my contract without having to incur any early cancellation_fees , they would send me a bag and all i had to do was send them their tv box .
negative	it was great , i found an amazing deal with sky !
negative	i mean literally all the tv_programmes , movies , sports , unlimited_internet , phone etc for about £_00 per_month !
negative	but then a few weeks_later i received a bill for about £_000 . 00 from talktalk .
negative	i rang up to dispute this and they said they had made a mistake and they would wipe the debt , however they could only wipe £_000 . 00 of it because £_000 . 00 of it was for the cost of the talktalk box although i still hadn_'_t received the bag to send the box back in the post .
negative	they said they would send one out straight_away .
negative	a few weeks_later i received a reminder from talktalk that if i didn_'_t pay them their money which had gone up from the original debt , they would pass me on to debt collections .
negative	i rang straight_away and said how dare they threaten me when its their problem , they apologised a lot said they made a note on the account and then told me they would send out another bag and that they made a note on the account .
negative	i then received the bag in the post and at the same time i received a final reminder saying that they had not received the payment and if they don_'_t within the next few_days they would pass the account onto debt_collectors , i rang talktalk furious saying i had only just received the bag and that i was planning to send the item out that day , they said that '_s fine as long as they receive it i will be okay , the guy on the phone even told me he would personally ring me back on friday which was about 0 days_later , and that he had made a note on the account .
negative	on friday i had no phone_call , however i did receive a letter from a debt collecting agency saying that my account had been passed_onto them and that talktalk want their money .
negative	i rang talktalk today and the guy said they had still not received the box but he would ring me when they do .. he said talktalk don_'_t have an email address for me to contact them but i told_him i refuse to ring them again .
negative	i doubt they actually do write a note on the account , it seems like people on here have mutual feeling about talktalk .
negative	i am absolutely furious , this has caused me stress , i have spent so much money ringing them up and being on hold , one time for 00_minutes !!!
negative	and my ordeal isn_'_t even over yet !
negative	avoid talktalk !
negative	!
negative	i booked a hire car for one day .
negative	i turned_up to pick_up the car and i was told there had been a mistake and that the car was 0 miles_away .
negative	no apologies or alternatives given - complete incompetence with a take it or leave it attitude .
negative	i could not accept this and had to make alternative_arrangements as i had to be in birmingham at an appointed time .
negative	having contacted rental_cars by e_- mail , i was then informed that a specialist had to be assigned to investigate and that once someone is available it could take up to 00 days to resolve .
negative	in the meantime i am informed that my booking was cancelled and that i am not due any refund .
negative	i have now been reimbursed my rental fee but i have asked why this happened in the first place and what guarantee can i get that it won_'_t happen again .
negative	to date there has_been no reply .
negative	endless spam after order !
negative	they dont give a chance to unsubscribe !
negative	order went well
negative	placed order 00 / 0 / 00
negative	not delivered
negative	sent 0 e_- mails no reply
negative	0 wasted queing phonecalls - last not ar desk
negative	order cancelled on site record
negative	money refunded on site record
negative	no money yet received
negative	after a hitachi deskstar hard_drive i purchased from tekheads that came with a standard ( global ) 0yr_warranty failed in its 0nd year i tried to return it directly to the manufacturer only to find it was a us model and that i had to " contact the supplier ".
negative	tekheads completely_ignored my first two emails and then when i called them they initially said they ' d replace it before changing their mind and flatly refusing to help stating that they only gave a 0 year_warranty .
negative	thankfully i '_ve now managed to get it exchanged via a friend who_lives in the states - i definitely won_'_t be using tekheads again .
negative	i ordered some pandora_charms 0_weeks_ago .
negative	they never arrived and i have contacted achica twice to ask for an update .
negative	the excuse provided was : unfortunately due to the volume of goods physically received the distribution_centre are slightly behind in despatching the orders .
negative	surely this is not a valid_reason ?
negative	if you know how many orders you have , you get the necessary staff in to despatch them .
negative	this is what any proper company would do !!
negative	and , to make_matters_worse , i have still not received my order .
negative	i don_'_t believe the correct item was sent having paid extra for delux flowers .
negative	also the note card i requested with the flowers never arrived .
negative	don_'_t use wren , this was the 0nd mistake and the worker i hired to fix the wardrobes charged me extra for having to use his own !
negative	wren conveniently just apologised , sent me screws after the installation and then responded that we were not in the wrong and as a company we don_'_t offer compensation .
negative	pathetic response and truly reflects the 0rd class service they offer .
negative	i sincerely say to future customers , don_'_t use them and go to a competitor who will offer a service and a quality product !
negative	dont get the argos_voucher - requires activation on 0000 number - pricey if you do it on a mobile - and 00hr notice as well - a real_pain when your voucher isnt for a lot of money anyway !
negative	will use a different company next time
negative	i hired a group h car ( mercedes_c or similar ) this spring in lisbon .
negative	when i went to the budget rental_desk to collect the car they informed me that a group e car ( ford_focus or similar ) had been reserved by holidayautos .
negative	i had to pay another €_000 on top of what i had already paid the get the car that i had on my rental voucher !
negative	thinking this would be resolved quickly i was ok with it at the time - the holidayautos agent advised me to do this as it was clearly a booking error & would get reimbursed after the rental .
negative	it '_s now been 0_weeks since the rental and holidayautos hasn_'_t even assigned someone to look into the issue , and have said it could be 0_weeks before they can !
negative	really not good service , so i dred to think what would happen if you had a complex problem with your rental .
negative	i ordered flowers for my daughter '_s birthday from floraqueen .
negative	it is the first time i '_ve_used them .
negative	the flowers did not arrive on her_birthday although she did receive a phone_call on that day asking her whether she would be in ( which she was ).
negative	the cost was high - 000_euros plus a small additional_charge for some unknown_reason .
negative	when i phoned to complain , i was told that i would have a full_refund but in fact they refunded an amount in sterling which was less_than it had cost me in euros .
negative	i also wasted the cost of two overseas calls ( to spain ) when placing the order .
negative	the only thing floraqueen are good at is taking your money .
negative	other than that , they are incompetent and dishonest .
negative	ordered two dozen bulbs and 0 arrived smashed , probably carriers , but should have been better prootected .
negative	purchased capella bedroom_furniture on 00 / 00 /_0000 home delivery .
negative	several emails later not received confirmation for delivery .
negative	finally they found order saying it was lost in system . the day arrived , guess_what 0 wardrobes missing , several emails later again they manage to locate order . delivery date 00 / 00 /_0000 another day off work , money lost . the point being all thi hassle but i noticed they never lost the money transfer in their system . i would not buy anything from this company as the tratmment is very poor .
negative	g chester . 0 out of 00 .
negative	despite the order summary of my tablet showing a certain value , with no sign of any delivery charges , days_later i got a letter from dhl asking for £_00 !
negative	this was for importing item into uk .
negative	this was never mentioned on the order summary and is not mentioned anywhere on the shipping and delivery section of the website .
negative	i will not be using this site again as the tablet turned_out to be more_expensive than buying from a uk store .
negative	i purchased the flowers to surprise someone for their birthday i hold very close to me .
negative	i have ordered from this site previously and flowers generally get delivered in the morning .
negative	before completing transaction i asked for the flowers to be delivered before 00 : 00 because the person_who it was for was leaving at 00 : 00 .
negative	however to my disappointment the flowers got delivered after the person left work and after i finished work at 0 : 00 .
negative	therefore , the flowers were left in the college ’_s mailing office , dying over the weekend , for her to receive it the monday_morning .
negative	i believe because what took place and the fact that the person did not receive the flowers on her_birthday i should be compensated as i am now an unhappy customer and will not be using this company in the future .
negative	i upgraded to the iphone 0 , the person in the o0 stores told me it would take 0mins for my number to change over from my old phone to the new one .
negative	a day and a half later and numerous phone_calls later to o0 still no joy .
negative	i ordered a hoodie and they sent me the wrong_size 0 times in a row after me sending it back so annoying .
negative	bought some stuff from a trade supplier forgetting that they use parcel_force , paid £_00 . 00 for am delivery for today .
negative	items were dispatched on tuesday 00st they were collected by parcel_force as normal checked track and trace because today is the day for delivery and turns_out my stuff is in belfast how can it get on a plane and to a different country without_any one spotting the mistake .
negative	at 00 . 00_hours there still in belfast
negative	do not use parcel_force please
negative	i have bought washing maschine as in stock and i paid for next_day delivery after that ive been waiting 0_weeks for delivery
negative	very rude customer service
negative	i will never use apliances direct again
negative	i was caught off guard by the cold caller who offered a discount on this product for £_00 , only if i paid there and then by credit_card over the phone .
negative	i received the email and found the product to be very hard to use , it is extremely basic with minimal functionality , no stock control , no shopping_basket , just paypal buttons , so you ' re dependant on paypal .
negative	i could not use it as i rely_on stock control and i had no faith that i would get any business from it at this point , so why waste effort making a shop .
negative	i punched myself in the face for being so stupid as to sign up to a service that i believed to be good just because a cold caller said it was .
negative	so i put it down to experience and vowed_never to talk to a cold caller again .
negative	after having a go and giving up , i haven_'_t used the product at all .
negative	0 year on i get a letter telling_me that my registration is about to be renewed for £_000 .
negative	i phoned to cancel , but was told i can '_t because i signed_up to a 0 year contract .
negative	obviously i was not made aware of this , why would anyone sign up to 0 years when they just want to trial the product for the first time ?
negative	when i checked the terms and conditions , it says minimum 0 year contract .
negative	but i didn_'_t even get the link to the terms and conditions ( which is hidden away at the bottom of the welcome email ) until after i had paid over the phone for the service .
negative	this is obviously intended to catch people out .
negative	when i phoned up , i was rudely_told that i had to pay else they would persue me for the money .
negative	they spoke to me like i was a numpty , not surprising because i must be a stupid to sign up to something like this .
negative	i wanted to order one shirt .
negative	i would of sent it to the u . s . ( my home country ) but for 00 pounds s / h for one shirt = way over priced !
negative	so i wanted to pay via_paypal and send it to germany where i was staying on holiday .
negative	so what happened ?
negative	the paypal system ( check out ) tried to keep sending my shirt to my paypal confirmed address ( the u . s .) and charge me 00 pounds s / h
negative	after calling them directly 0 times to complain_about paying for my shirt with paypal to send to germany they did .
negative	well .... the manager did .
negative	so what happen ?
negative	they didn_'_t fully write my name and my friends name on the package and the german post_office tried the package once and sent it back to the company .
negative	like really ?
negative	no notice left ?
negative	nothing !
negative	i wasted 00 pounds for s / h ($ 00 . 00 usd ) and i never got my shirt .
negative	never would of had this problem in the first place if s / h to the u . s . a . was 0 pounds like it should be !!!
negative	!
negative	thanks for wasting my time and money !!
negative	!
negative	stay clear away from this " company ", it is the biggest ripoff i have ever come_across and wasn_'_t able to do anything about it !
negative	these reviews on trustpilot are soooo not reliable and i assume they are fake , after my bad_experience with doyouspain . com i checked tripadvisor . com and read all the horror oboe things about them , i wish i had read them ...
negative	my experience :
negative	ripoff no . 0 :
negative	i rented a car in gran_canaria which supposed to cost 00 £ roughly according to their website , i received emails quick witch confirmations etc .
negative	they kept sending me mails about " insurance ", to buy it through doyouspain . com for like 00 - 00 £ otherwise i ' d be paying around 00 € at the airport in gran_canaria .
negative	i thought to myself , i do not need an insurance .
negative	once i got to gran_canaria i was told i have to buy an insurance for 00 € or i pay them 000 € just in case something happens as deposit , 000 € is ridiculous anyway ...
negative	i got so upset and said " ok , charge my card 000 € i don_'_t want to pay for insurance ", the lady was obviously not expecting this response and said that debit_cards cannot be charged 000 € and literally forced me to take up the insurance !
negative	so i got setback for a super shitty car like vw_polo by 000 € plus the 00 £ i paid already .
negative	on to the next thing they ripped me off with .
negative	ripoff no . 0 :
negative	she then told me that i have to pay for the fuel that is in the car .
negative	i suddenly_became i real victim that has no power to do anything about it at the point , i said i don_'_t want the car and the lady threatened me that the 00 £ i paid in initially will be gone for good !
negative	so , i got scared that i end up with no car because of the season and overpaid .
negative	guess_what they charged me for fuel ....?
negative	i had to pay 00 € for fuel which seems to be normal when you ' re from the uk or germany , but i drove the car nuts so i ran_out of the fuel and had to refuel the car .
negative	once i got to the patrol station i realized that in gran_canaria 0 liter of fuel_costs like 0 , 00 € or 0 , 00 € which is not as much as the car_rental company charged me .
negative	i thought ok , i fuel the car with 00 € and guess_what ...
negative	the tank was half full !!!
negative	!
negative	this was a modern way of riping off people !
negative	stay_away from doyouspain . com and goldcar !!!
negative	!
negative	this has to be the worst website for travelers anywhere in the world .
negative	the whole website has to be revamped .
negative	some of the places that are reviewed such as restaurants have photos of different places which are obviously in the place . some are closed_down and do not exist and in other cases i have been let_down by reviews .
negative	this has spoilt two of my holidays in the last 00 months .
negative	i have tried to communicate with customer_services at tripadvisor but all they seem to do is put your email on hold for 00_hours so that it looks_like they are doing something but they are really not .
negative	the concentrate more on booking buddy and gate guru as they are owned by tripadvisor .
negative	all they do is reply time and time again to say that the reviews , photos and details meet there guidelines .
negative	looks_like all they want to do is make money for expedia and guide you towards hotels where they make most money .
negative	i prefer lonely planet anytime as they never get it wrong .

negative	plumbnation failed to deliver on two occasions , and never bothered to even tell me they would not be coming so i have wasted two_days waiting in for nothing .
negative	they have failed to respond to all the issues i raised in an email to them .
negative	i tried twice to telephone them but waited so long whilst listening to their telephone advertising telling_me how good they were that my phone eventually cut_off .
negative	three_days have passed since my last email to them and they now tell me that i have to wait another five days before they can tell me if they will be delivering any time soon .
negative	seems very unfair when they take your money immediately then do not uphold their part of the deal .
negative	would not recommend this company to anyone
negative	this company is the worst to be experienced since a long time :
negative	we ordered our internet online .
negative	first they did not process the order , as we called they said the account is open now .
negative	from then on they charge us double and do not quite doing it .
negative	they even lie to us by saying that they won_'_t be doing it .
negative	as i can proof it through my bank state i am on a quite certain side .
negative	additionally their service people never any clue about our package or any service we have ordered .
negative	not only is an amount charged double but also the wrong amount ( higher ).
negative	further they keep on sending us bills we should pay for we have not ordered .
negative	let '_s see where this is leading to .
negative	maybe a lawyer would help getting heard .
negative	just annoying this company !
negative	my recommendation : stay_away from talk_talk , you will regret signing_up !
negative	ordered my camera on 00th_april expecting a dispatch within 0 - 0 business days as stated on simply_electronics website .
negative	the money (£_000 ) was taken out of my account the following_day .
negative	three_weeks_later the order is still showing a new status with no_indication of dispatch date .
negative	my first email to them requesting an estimated dispatch received a general statement relating to problems they were having but they would do their best to dispatch as soon as possible .
negative	my second email was more specific relating to an estimated delivery but again received a response informing_me that they could not give an indication but as a gesture of goodwill they would expedite the order at no extra_cost to me .
negative	well i am_glad i didn_'_t have to pay for this service since it made no difference to the order status .
negative	seeing that others had problems waiting for a refund following cancellation i decided to raise the issue with my card company and received a refund within 00_hours .
negative	they are no doubt the cheapest supplier in this market but one of the worst service providers i have come_across .
negative	their website is festooned with acceditation on service which in my case they didn_'_t live up to .
negative	if your priority is cost and you are prepared for a long wait for your goods then they may be the suppplier for you .
negative	otherwise stay_away .
negative	my boyfriend ordered the upgraded flowers as a valentines suprise , payed £_00 extra !!!!
negative	for morning delivery and the small bouquet turn_up half_dead .
negative	it ruined his day and i was not happy either .
negative	the only remote good thing was they paid him back but no compensation as way of apologizing .
negative	my son looked up the best price for his iphone_0s and this company came top .
negative	sent the phone off , and when we called them to find out what was going on , we were told it can to up to 00 days before the get a chance to looke at the phone , a few_days_later my son called again and was told the phone is know worth £_000 not the £_000 stated due to water_damage , which i find hard to beleive as the phone is only 0 months old .
negative	spoke with a lady_called raj who told me that we had to go onto the system and cancell the order , which we did , that was last tuesday , today we call them again only to be told that payment has_been sent to my account for £_000 , after a long chat raj told me that she would give me their account details so that i could put the money backm into their account .
negative	when i aske her the account number they had sent the money to see then told me it was a cheque has_been sent out .
negative	asked if i could speak to a manager and she would not put me through , asked if any body regulates them and raj refused to answer .
negative	the up shot is that my son has had phone for nearly 0_weeks and to top it all off they want £_00 of me so they can sebd the phone back .
negative	please do not use this company they are the shocking ...
negative	ordered some disco lights from a company in london that dpd collected on 0th_december that still_havent arrived .
negative	received an email yesterday informing_me that the parcel was at thier depot in birmingham along with the usual lame_excuse about the weather .
negative	its not bad for a delivery firm when you consider theyve managed to get a parcel 000_miles in nine days and still no sign of it getting here .
negative	and it was sent on thier next_day service !!!!!!!!!!!!
negative	!
negative	this firm would make an ideal candidate for the tv program dont get done get dom .
negative	i have used just eat many a time as it '_s easier for me to pay by card rather_than cash .
negative	everytime i order through the website it takes the double the time if i call and pay by cash .
negative	today i ordered through the website and on confirmation it said for collection .
negative	why would i order and pay an extra_charge to order through a website for collection .
negative	i then had to ring the takeaway place who said they are delivering the order and to ignore just eat as they had asked them to get this sorted many_times .
negative	why should i order through this website and pay the charge if i then have to call direct anyway .
negative	i might as well give that extra little_bit of money to the company .
negative	its clear just eat are out for there profit only and dont care about the bad light they put the takeaway services they represent in .
negative	wont be using again - would far rather pay the high prices for deliverence with much_better service levels if i find myself in a cashless situation again .
negative	while the champagne is fine , the courier managed to deliver to the wrong house .
negative	well i say delivered , that is if being chucked outside the wrong house in the rain .
negative	customer service is dyer - " its the time of year " and " the courier has to deliver them " - er well try the correct house and maybe that would happen .
negative	absolutely_useless !
negative	use at your own_peril f - 0 / 0
negative	part checked located and purchased through parts_gateway .
negative	however , when part arrived it was a textured bumper , not a primed .
negative	cost for primed including_vat and carriage £_000 .
negative	cost of textured £_00 plus_vat , i organised and paid carriage as they could not deliver to northern_ireland .
negative	e_mail photo '_s to prove wrong part , they agreed , but could do nothing as boss was off !
negative	told them i could work with bumper as none available in primed , but was going to cost me extra .
negative	they can '_t do anything boss is off .
negative	they eventually offer me £_00 back , not good enough .
negative	went to £_00 for carriage and £_00 .
negative	i explained there original quote was £_00 plus_vat i should only be paying £_000 less extra work costs .
negative	advised that it was available for collection and i would accept the correct one in its place .
negative	they wanted me to pay carriage on way back for the mistake .
negative	got fed_up with them agreed £_000 credit , which still means i paying over the original quote by £_00 plus extra work , 00 days ago .
negative	still_waiting for money to go into my account . i am totally_disgusted .
negative	will never use car and van parts direct again , i have tried to be easy going and nice about this as mistakes_happen , but to no_avail , next steps consumer_protection agency , solicitor , i have the quotes , pictures and contacts .
negative	appalling customer service .
negative	purchased goods and was told 0 - 0 days delivery .
negative	then was told , once paid for , that the order was going to be split .
negative	beyond all understanding the 0 speakers were split into 0 separate_orders .
negative	once i received on time the other due in a further 00 days .
negative	vendor would not help or budge at all .
negative	very unhappy .
negative	seeking redress from credit_card .
negative	bad_experience with this one , avoid
negative	will not be using again .
negative	service and delivery were good ( i had about 00 separate texts / emails_confirming and reconfirming ) and the flowers arrived on time , but what a disappointment .
negative	for the grandissimo size bouquet ( approx .
negative	£_00 ) we got 0 gerbras , a few unopened lillies and a lot of green .
negative	the bouquet was mostly padded out with gypsophila ( all of which i removed before giving to my wife ).
negative	delivery was £_00 extra so , though that was good , the flowers were very poor value .
negative	would review product if i had received it .
negative	but one month later ...
negative	very disappointed !
negative	i bought festive solar_lights that do not work .
negative	i was told by the very helpful customer service department : festive solar_lights do not work in the winter .
negative	they sell xmas_lights that work in summer !
negative	do not use .
negative	do not use .
negative	do not use .
negative	avoid .
negative	another dodgy online company .
negative	m ' n '_s building automations are dodgy .
negative	so i ordered from this companys other website , savewithleds . co . uk before foolishly spotting they have no telephone_number listed online .
negative	it wasn_'_t until later i found out that they are the same company as mns automation solutions .
negative	£_00 spent on leds not sent , they started ignoring emails , luckily i ' d used paypal who got the money back to me after a claim .
negative	utter time_wasters and should be avoided at all cost .
negative	very disappointing , booked via parcel0ship and citylink courier didn_'_t come .
negative	had to ask repeatedly for a refund of the courier charge and no additional compensation was offered .
negative	parcel0ship blaming citylink , but i was a customer of parcel0ship not citylink !
negative	buying from this company caused me numerous problems would not use them again
negative	i find talking to this company on the phone very difficult and in the end a waste of time
negative	i ordered a set of pans on 00th_december_0000 .
negative	they hadn_'_t arrived by the00th so a rang up .
negative	i was told that as the pans were coming directly from the supplier that they would have to contact them .
negative	i got a call a few minutes later to say that the suppliers could not deliver as the pans were discontinued .
negative	i appreciate that this is not active_mobility '_s fault as the supplier accepted the order .
negative	i was told that my money would be refunded and i requested confirmation of this by email .
negative	to date i have not received the said email ( 00 / 00 /_0000 ) and today i receive an email from them asking me to revue my purchase .
negative	i am awaiting my january_0000 credit_card statement to see if they have refunded my money before taking further_action .
negative	i needed to return a package to amazon for a refund and arranged for yodel to pick it up from me on a thursday .
negative	i took time off work to wait in for them and of course after waiting all day from 0am ( in retrospect just a little_bit optimistic i admit ) no one showed up .
negative	i emailed them via the link on the original confirmation_email address and eventually received back a couple of apologetic replies for the apparent hitch .
negative	they told me that sometimes a van driver can be delayed and it might be as late as 0pm before anyone arrived .
negative	however in an email from a different yodel employee i was told the latest for collections was 0pm so as far as operating times is concerned with this lot it '_s anyone '_s guess .
negative	anyway , they re - scheduled collection for the next_day and , once again i arranged time off work to wait in for them .
negative	well of course - yes you got it - no sign of any yodel ' ers all day .
negative	i emailed back the company at around 0 :_00pm to get some idea of what was happening and to get confirmation that there would definitely be a collection but this time didn_'_t receive any replies back at all .
negative	in frustration i phoned the local yodel depot and asked if they could shine any light on all of this .
negative	the assistant , whom i admit was very pleasant , asked me for my name and post_code so as to check on the status of my collection .
negative	thinking it would be more efficient if they used the customer reference_number which had been supplied in the original email , i offered that instead .
negative	" oh we can '_t use those on our system - they never worked anyway " was the reply !
negative	dear god !
negative	anyway having punched my name and address into the computer it eventually said ' no '.
negative	incredibly they could_find no record of me at all .
negative	in the end i contacted amazon , explained the problem and with the help of amazon '_s customer_support staff have arranged for another carrier to pick it up in a few_days time hopefully with more luck this time .
negative	i have also sent a letter to amazon asking them not to use this carrier in the future and i would suggest everyone_else with similar_experiences of this company do the same .
negative	amazon '_s business reputation is going to be tarnished by even being associated with these_cowboys .
negative	i '_ve also had similar_experiences to those mentioned by others with this company regarding deliveries .
negative	' you were out ' cards left in our underground_car_park for us saying they had called and had tried to deliver a parcel when i know with absolute certainty that they didn_'_t - my door buzzer is as loud as a ww0 air raid siren .
negative	like black holes , the mere existence of this company is a complete and utter mystery to me .
negative	once anything gets sucked into it , it '_s nigh impossible to get it back out again ( that '_s the black_hole of course but you see the eerie similarity ).
negative	the website offered me a discount and i successfully placed an order including paying on my credit_card .
negative	i got a phone_call the next_day to say that the website should not have offered me the discount and that ld_mountain centre would not honour the price and they tried to get more money out of me .
negative	i think that '_s a pretty poor show , personally , so i cancelled the order .
negative	i have been on the phone twice already to sort_out a billing error , each time being told i would receive an amended bill .
negative	this didn_'_t happened .
negative	instead i received a non - payment warning with the imposing threat of bay lifts .
negative	after a long 00 minute wait on the phone i was cut_off , and had to call again .
negative	i was again assured it had all been sorted , however a further letter with a £_00 charge for a court charge .
negative	again , another phone_call resulted_in an amended bill , with the previously incorrect charges added to a new bill !
negative	two more attempts to call - both between 00_mins and 00_mins waiting and i gave up .
negative	their customer service is some of the worst i '_ve experienced .
negative	i contrast , a call to british_gas at the same time got my query resolved within 0 mins .
negative	my partner recently had a shocking experience with a mobile_recycling " company " cash0phones
negative	i left an honest appraisal of the company on here and was shocked to find my review had been taken off as it had been reported as false .
negative	any negative 0_star reviews on this company are always reported and subsequently removed whilst the amazing but obvious false pr driven 0_star reviews are still there .
negative	it '_s a sham that a company can just report the negative_reviews and have them taken off
negative	i complained to trustpilot and they did nothing !
negative	this company is 00th out of 00 in their list of recycling_firms so to have no negative_reviews showing is a farce .
negative	it '_s also eye opening that trustpilot is also bottom in the marks of their own rating comparison !
negative	trustpilot , if you want credibility then you have got to clamp down on these companies that report all their negative_reviews and post pr spun 0 line 0_star reviews .
negative	a review site is supposed to be impartial but this one isn_'_t !
negative	please_please_please do what a review site is supposed to do and show reviews good and bad - dont make it so easy to block a bad review just because a company is paying you to be on your site .
negative	for pages and pages of reviews to have been reported and subsequently removed on this one company surely shows that there is something amiss ??
negative	?
negative	i ordered an espresso_machine and some cups / saucers and requested that both be delivered together .
negative	as i was not at home when the delivery arrived i arranged a re - delivery with the dpd , the couriers , and had it confirmed both parts ofthe order were together .
negative	i had to pay an extremely harsh £_00 premium to have this delivered at a convenient time ( basically the free delivery is a joke if you do not work at home - be warned ) early one morning - and there is no option to have the delivery made to any address apart_from your own postcode .
negative	despite paying for an agreed delivery i received texts and emails to say a redeliveries had been attempted again on subsequent days - a complete_waste of time , fuel and cost for dpd and hardly a green approach to deliveries .
negative	one day before the arranged delivery i received a second delivery card with a different dispatch number so rang dpd again and was told that this related to the second part of my order that i had been told was combined with the first .
negative	hence i arranged that both parcels be delivered together .
negative	the following_morning , one box arrived as arranged and i showed the delivery driver both delivery cards and was told both items were in one box .
negative	of course , once opened , only the espresso_machine was inside so i had to call dpd again to find out the whereabouts of the second part of my order and was told it must be my own fault as a second delivery was attempted later that morning ( 0 hours after the cut_off time i had paid for and 0 hours after the first delivery ) and i had not been in .
negative	after the ensuing debate - it was agreed dpd would deliver the second box this saturday_morning ( for free rather_than have to pay a further £_00 ), which has just arrived at last .
negative	ive just opened the box and it contains a pair of kitchen scales .
negative	its a joke
negative	my experience was telling_me that i would simply never order another product where i could establish dpd were the couriers .
negative	i will now add that go electric appear to to be equally inept - i checked the order and invoice sent - and both were correct but the delivery was completely wrong .
negative	im at the point where i hardly care if the product works or not
negative	terrible quality shed , flimsy , under - engineered , even worse customer service - they claimed to be very serious about customer service , but basically not interested in my dissatisfaction with their product .
negative	i would really recommend going else where - they may be cheap , but not worth it .
negative	this is the first time i '_ve tried using them .
negative	i thought i would use their price match_promise , quoting another sites product .
negative	all they did was cancel my order with them .
negative	as i '_ve started keeping discus i '_m currently buying lots of equipment but i won_'_t be using them again .
negative	i also just bought the items from their competitor .
negative	this is the email they sent me
negative	hi stephen ,
negative	we have investigated your price match request and unfortunately cannot fulfil it as , although a valid competitors price has_been quoted , it is below our buying in price for the item ( s ).
negative	this is unusual but can happen if a competitor is unaware of a recent price increase .
negative	in this situation if the competitor has the item ( s ) in stock and will honour their advertised price we would recommend going with them .

negative	.........................................
negative	i was unable to give this company a zero_star_rating but if i could , i would .
negative	paid a substantial_amount of money for a pre_- completion check on a property '_s gas and electric check i found them to be hugely overpriced with shocking , truly shocking levels of customer service .
negative	i had to call and email at_least twice to receive the gas check report but rather_than giving the report to me , the person paying , they gave it to the owner of the property who i was looking to buy the house from .
negative	and to top it all off despite using serviceteam ( for my sins ) in january_0000 they have only just emailed me now - late april - asking for a review of their service .
negative	i think that tells you all you need to know about this company .
negative	if using them for pre_- completion checks on a property you want to buy , avoid these_people at all costs .
negative	your wallet will be much_lighter , and your blood_pressure much higher , if you do .
negative	extremely poor recommend a friend scheme ........ still_awaiting payment .
negative	.... 0 months is ridiculous !
negative	won_'_t be recommending anyone again
negative	i bought a ticket to see the rolling_stones in stockholm .
negative	it was easy to buy and pay for but what happened then was a disaster .
negative	first , the ticket never arrived as it was lost in transit !
negative	second , the replacement ticket ( seemingly not to the same value of the first ) turned_out to be fake and i could not get in to the concert !
negative	what with the added expense of flights , hotels etc the whole trip was a total_failure .
negative	and i am still_waiting for viagogo '_s response !
negative	ps my order id was 0000000 , and the initial one was 0000000 .
negative	i bought one just so they would stop ringing me , utter_rubbish from_start to finish .
negative	how this shower have gained plc status staggers me .
negative	this company are the worst company i have ever come_across for outstandingly bad customer service / relations .
negative	they do not respond to emails , telephone_calls or letters !
negative	but demand payment for a service they do not supply !
negative	i booked an oil and filter_change on - line and got a booking slot for some 0 days_later , had to pay in advance for some reason , and within 0 hour was called by custmer service who said that the branch_manager did not have any of that oil in stock !
negative	how can it take more than 00_hours to get some ?
negative	very poor .
negative	i have been with 000 - reg over 00 years_now buying domain_names
negative	to host on my servers and not there '_s by the way .
negative	i renewed one of my domain_names
negative	on 00 mar_0000 outofthebloom . com to be precise paid in full and have a
negative	receipt for the payment .
negative	the domain is still off line while they are
negative	changing registrars is what they told me .
negative	to put insult to injury they
negative	have the domain_name pointing to a site that is ppc .
negative	i phoned them on monday 00th
negative	and was told it would be up by the thur 00 mar to confirm that they told me to look
negative	in my 000 - reg control_panel .
negative	i took a copy of the details so could show me client .
negative	i then called today to find out why it is still not showing only to be told the domain
negative	will not be up until tue 0nd_april .
negative	because i took a copy of the web_site when it was showing 00 / 0 and now 0 / 0 that now makes the
negative	domain_name that i have paid for in full will be off line for 00 days .
negative	my domain_name off line for 00 days i you cannot do nothing about it with 000 - reg .
negative	the administrative contact has also changed to @ domainbox . net by the way is a company that
negative	000 - reg recently_bought .
negative	i realy had high regards for 000 - reg and recomended all my clients to them .
negative	this has totaly
negative	changed the way i feel about the company plus i have now lost a valuable client because of all this .
negative	don_’_t use 000reg .
negative	this company has lost my trust completely .
negative	try to use a direct / root registrar if at all possible .
negative	cant rate lower_than one star sadly
negative	waiting for item for a week and asked for a review in between so here it is .
negative	no item received no email_saying when it could be delivered .
negative	paid £_000 + for trainers that i found slightly_cheaper afterwards with next_day delivery .
negative	not happy .
negative	i bought 0 tickets for manchester big reunion tour on morning sat 0 may , received 0hr later by e ticket , then went to concert at 0pm same day to be told that the tickets had been cancelled by previous_owner that morning shortly_after i had bought them , nothing could be done at the arena as they have no control over viagogo , so had to purchase further 0 tickets , original ones were at the front we are now situated at the back , viagogo close at 0pm on sat so contacted paypal following_day and emailed viagogo to tell them what happened , payment been accepted but paypal opened up a case which takes 00 days , viagogo sent claim_form through email which has to be sent back in 0 days or they will not deal with it , this took 0 days to try and open as no software to open the attachment , email it bk no response , fax it back nope dead line , phoned them sat at 0pm sorry all lines closed erm 00am till_0pm advertised times , use thier website to contact its just a maze of random confusing questions which sends you anywhere , all you can do is email the same thing as you had done 0 days previous , as they say on thier webpage they pay the seller immediatly after thier tickets being sold but trying to get your money back or proper response is unbelievable .
negative	in my eyes this company is a front for counterveiiting people making money of genuine people and they are not taking things seriously .
negative	transaction_id_0000000
negative	i know the kit that i bought was for scuba_diving , but i did not expect it to get wet so soon !
negative	there was no one home when the delivery person called , so my order was left near the front_door , in the pouring_rain and got soaking_wet .
negative	the clips were ok but the dive log binder did not fair so well .
negative	a couple of hours on the radiator sorted it – but that ’_s not the point .
negative	first time i ’ ve_used these_guys – probably_won_’_t risk it again within anything that cannot be left out to the elements .
negative	i paid 00 . 00 for saturday delivery it is now the following_monday and i have not received my order .
negative	no reply through email and couldn_'_t get through on the phone avoid at all cost
negative	i placed my order on 00feb order itself didn_'_t ship until the 00 and now its 0 mar ... and i '_m still_waiting .
negative	should have just gone with bodybuilding . com which gets their stuff out here in 0 days tops .
negative	the wait on just processing alone should have been the wait time for processing and shipping for $_00 dollar shipping charge ... that is outrageous !
negative	i don_'_t know where to start .
negative	they messed_up my booking , never told me .
negative	i tried to sought it out as politely has possible .
negative	i don_'_t want to be one of those customer who shout to get their way .
negative	i found the operator rude , unhelpful and condescending .
negative	as i said , i did my best not to be rude , but understanding .
negative	he did not in anyway try to understand my confusion .
negative	if i was honest i would recommend this company to my best friend or my worst energy .
negative	very sad indeed .
negative	i bought a salad from my local asda and when i was about to eat it i found a dead caterpillar inside it .
negative	i took picture of it and called the head_office they said i need to give it back to the store and they will give me the refund and investigate and i will be sent a goodwill voucher .
negative	when i went to return the salad the lady on the counter served a lady before me who left her pregnancy test strip on the desk , the lady said ohhh she left her dirty strip here then she covered her hand and picked_up the strip to chuck it in the bin and dint even apologize to me before serving me .
negative	i called the head_office to see whats_happening with my case and i was told that its registered as a complaint and if i wanted them to investigate then i should have told them , after that they took my details and the manager of the local asda called to say sorry . i sent an email after that but i guess its case dismissed .
negative	i bought the 00_%_off get bike deal .
negative	i was told that i can book the day anytime and the voucher is valid till jun 0000 , but yesterday i checked my account and it showed £_00 . 00 taken out already and was over drawn so ill be charged on top , even_though i did not call the centre to book my day of training .
negative	i sent an email to groupon for refund but no reply yet .
negative	been here a while now never win anything , i see the previous comment saying you have too be in it too win , well they say they are new , wait_till they have been playing a while they will change there tune . i am always in but never ever win anything over 0o pound and very rarely win that . cms are ignorant have there fav all the time , same winners in ever game .
negative	dont_bother guys a waste of money , one big con .
negative	this was the first and last time i will use topcashback .
negative	had the problem getting my money from the deal then get told theres a £ 0 fee thats just not right
negative	problem started when i asked xln to transfer the broadband from one line to another ( i had 0 phone lines from xln ).
negative	instead they ceased one phone line as well as the broadband .
negative	i called their customer service and was told that the line was ceased due to a ' system error ' while broadband due to severe_weather_conditions , which i obviously knew was an utter_rubbish .
negative	i was told several_times that someone will call me back to resolve the issue , but they never did .
negative	i would say i was forced to terminate the contract with xln purely_because of their awful customer service .
negative	i have received a letter telling_me that i will have to pay £_000 termination charges .
negative	i called their cancellation department and explained the situation and loss of business i suffered due to their incompetencies .
negative	i was told that i should have given a written notice after giving xln time period of 00 days to fix the problem .
negative	only then i would have been entitled to terminate the contract without paying termination charges .
negative	i think they are rob dogs they charge to much for using papal .. i wont have nothing paid into paypal as they want a arm & a leg for using them . no thanks
negative	based on an internet page that said that serenata specialises in flower_deliveries to italy i placed an order for mothers_day a week in advance .
negative	two_days after they were due to be delivered ( i . e .
negative	after mothers_day ) i received a request for a destination phone number , which i had already included on my original order .
negative	i duly provided that , received acknowledgement from customer service and then the next_day was informed that my order had been cancelled on the grounds that i had not provided the necessary_information .
negative	mothers_day missed , and now no flowers at all .
negative	i phoned customer service to complain ( mysteriously cut_off mid - conversation first time ), expecting profuse_apologies and a gesture of compensation .
negative	instead i got stonewalling and blaming of the italian florist .
negative	what an appalling service and even worse attitude to customer service .
negative	it strikes me that florists are one of those groups of businesses that pretty_much have to get it right .
negative	if you send flowers you need to know they are going to get there .
negative	if they don_'_t , someone is going to get upset .
negative	if the florist fails , they really need to make a fuss .
negative	don_'_t expect serenata to deliver and especially don_'_t expect them to help you out after things go_wrong .
negative	i realised i had ordered flowers for wrong date immediately after completing order . clicked on contact us and sent message with correct date , recieved no reply so sent another message within twenty mins . then had to go to work , got home later that day still no reply . sent a third message and then recieved a reply saying it was too late to amend order . i sent a fourth message_saying my first two messages had not been answered and had been sent straight after initial order . recieved another reply saying again it was too late to change order . in other words their contact us web peg is a waste of time .
negative	i ordered three items and paid for next_day delivery .
negative	two items did no turn_up the next_day .
negative	after two_days i chased this and was told they didn_'_t find one of the items when the came to do the picking .
negative	it '_s appalling that i had to chase them to find this out , and they also could have at_least sent the remaining item that was in stock .
negative	i ordered an iphone 0 online with this company back in september and had to pay £_00 deposit which would come off my 0th bill .
negative	i cancelled the contract after a week after orange said they did not know when i ' d receive the phone and i would get my £_00 back within a month .
negative	a month had past and still no refund !
negative	after spending 0 hours on the phone getting transferred from one department to the next the phone went dead ( lines had closed ) ring again the following_day and was told i would receive my refund in 00 days .
negative	00 days_later and still nothing !
negative	rang again and told yet again 00 days .
negative	it '_s not the end of december and i still have not had a refund .
negative	who do they think they are ?
negative	if i owed them money they would soon be on my back for it !
negative	i have had to result in writing a letter to them threatening_legal_action !
negative	like i have nothing better to do with my time that writing letters to them asking for my money back .
negative	will never go with orange in the future !
negative	ordered a phone back in june , changed my mind the following_day .
negative	rang to cancel and was told it wouldn_'_t be a problem .
negative	0 days_later get an email to say my phone is being shipped ( apparently it was too late to stop it from being sent ?).
negative	refuse delivery , courier takes phone away .
negative	phones 0 u then lose it , and launch an internal investigation .
negative	it '_s now september , phones 0 u say they ' re waiting for t - mobile whilst t - mobile are waiting for phones 0 u - they have also damaged my credit_history due to not having received a payment .
negative	wtf am i supposed to do ?
negative	i never had the phone , i don ; t have it now and yet no - one seems willing to sort it .
negative	do not use this shower of incompetents , you * will * regret it .
negative	avoid at all costs .
negative	i would give no stars if it was permitted .
negative	purchased a supposedly brand - new electronic_drum_kit online .
negative	soon became evident from the poor condition of the packaging and the visible wear and tear marks on the drum pads that the kit was infact second - hand .
negative	the set was also missing its throne and bass_pedal - stated as being inclusive of the drum package .
negative	the module and other elements had to be returned because of being faulty , only for them to get ‘ lost ’ in the post ( staff reported as to having no recollection of me stating items were defective – it was them who initially requested me to return them !
negative	).
negative	staff were extremely rude , unhelpful and lied throughout the entire_process .
negative	i also bought a ‘ new ’ electric_guitar alongside the drum_kit order , only for this to arrive as well in a sorry state – packaging badly_damaged , deep_scratches to the guitar and parts absent .
negative	staff again were extremely unhelpful by having no determination to rectify the situation – outrageous considering the vast_amounts of money spent on the two instruments .
negative	i have had a terrible experience overall and would strongly_advise people to avoid this company at all costs .
negative	good luck if you are currently pursuing problems with this business – i am obviously a nuisance to them now asking for what i have paid for and , as a result , have had my email address blacklisted !
negative	well what can i say , i have some late deliveries in my time but have never had to collect a parcel from a courier services depot , they had contact number if they had problems and for some strange reason couldnt even find my address and have many deliveries to this house , the worst ever courier service i have ever had a due to that will be changing the company who used them to send my items .
negative	they wernt rude to me infact couldn , t even get to speak to a human on the phone as it was automated ( wonder_why ) , im generally a placid person but this got my blood boiling , sort yourselves out !!!!!!!!!
negative	!
negative	postage too expensive .
negative	despite several phone_calls i am still_waiting for a printer i ordered before_christmas .
negative	three_weeks plus now .
negative	i was told that snow was to blame a week_ago .
negative	but 0 ) they managed to deliver the toner .
negative	0 ) the snow was over by then .
negative	they have made no attempt to contact me with an update .
negative	my experience was not good with this company .
negative	i sent them my ipad 00gb as my on - line quote was £_000 - boxed , full working order , usb_lead and in my opinion excellent condition as it has had a full cover on from day 0 .
negative	when they received my ipad they sent me an offer of £_000 !
negative	i checked the website and i found in the time i had sent my ipad they had dramatically dropped the price of the trade in on ipad 0 which is fine , but i found they had rated my ipad in bad condition - scratched front and back , with a dent on the side apparently !
negative	i can understand there to be a difference in opinion for the condition but not by this much !
negative	what make it worse in my opinion is that they will only agree to the price quoted if they agree the condition , so where as my ipad could have been worth £_000 in the condition that they though it was , because the only agreed price is £_000 they new price is now £_000 which i think is wrong , and i would have been happy to accept the £_000 .
negative	all '_s well that ends well though , i asked for my ipad back and then i sent it to carphonewarehouse yesterday and they have just replied by email agreeing the top price of an excellent condition ipad of £_000 . 00 ( which probably would have been more if i hadn_'_t have had my time wasted by gadgetpanda !
negative	i ordered . black classic tubing and when it was late arriving i contacted the company who said classic takes longer it '_s says so on the site .
negative	person rude and site misleading
negative	they have mastered the art of selling crap food in brighlty packaged wrappers endorsed by the latest movie with plastic toys as a gift and streamlined your lunch order to do you want fries with that or do you want to go large ( what round the waste ) no thanks !!
negative	!
negative	while the product was fine , the delivery ruined the whole_thing .
negative	despite the road name being clearly_marked , the driver didn_'_t even bother to go down the road named , but decided he knew better and attempted to deliver to a different building , which was locked up .
negative	adding insult to injury , using his ' initiative ; he decided to deliver to the invoice_address , thus giving my wife her 00th_birthday_present 00 days early , while i stood pointlessly looking out for his_van at the delivery address .
negative	time to get new couriers , go - electrical .
negative	i received a note saying delivered to a friend which i queried and found it impossible to get clarified in serenatas system .
negative	when the flowers arrived they were very poor value - 0 stems for £_00 !!
negative	!
negative	iwill seek recompense and an explanation before using again
negative	i wanted to arrange a multiple destination ( and quite costly ) trip to the usa at fairly short_notice , as my son was interested in finding out about us universities .
negative	i had pretty_much worked out what flights and train_journeys we needed to book but thought i ' d just call to check if a discount would be available in recognition of the number of flights involved .
negative	i never got a straight answer to that question and that '_s when the real nightmare began .
negative	when i received confirmation of the flight details i noticed one of the flights was booked for the wrong time and we would miss our appointment .
negative	when i called them they said they would need to check the recording of the call , which they would do very carefully .
negative	i thought that was fair_enough and was confident that everything would be sorted_out , as i knew i had been totally clear about the timings .
negative	then they told me it would take several days for them to get back to me with their findings , which meant the flight might become full in the meantime or the ticket price would increase .
negative	they said they quite understood my concern and would be prepared to change the flight to the correct time , provided i paid a change fee in advance of of £_000 which would be refunded if i was vindicated by the call recording .
negative	i reluctantly_agreed , then they later called to say this would apply per person !
negative	i tried to contact them several_times afterwards but they never responded and never_let_me know the outcome of their investigation into the detail of the call .
negative	in fact i never_heard from them again and an entire year has now passed .
negative	their customer service is appalling , completely lacking in any sensitivity and their behaviour borders on the criminal .
negative	somehow i don_'_t think this reflects the original vision and passion with which martha lane fox established the company and i '_m_sure she would be mortified if she knew how they treat their customers today .
negative	i have used lastminute . com for the last time in my life .
negative	i wish i ' d read these reviews before placing my first ( and last !)
negative	order with this company for two ink_cartridges .
negative	with no product and no contact to tell me what was happening i ended_up called them three_times .
negative	their call_centre is so noisy you can hardly hear_anything .
negative	the first time they said they were arranging for another supplier to provide the product because they didn_'_t have it in stock .
negative	it would have been helpful to know that before i had to call in .
negative	following another couple of weeks and another unanswered email , i was told in a second call that the reason i still had no product was that the third_party supplier had failed to respond ( could they not have tried a different one ?)
negative	but they would definitely get in touch and call to update me - as if !
negative	in the third call they complained that they had been " dealing_with a backlog of orders " and were experiencing " problems with our new systems ".
negative	after nearly seven weeks they finally agreed to give me a refund which i am still_waiting with eager anticipation .
negative	their upbeat website gives the impression of a company that will deliver - and quickly .
negative	my experience was nothing of the sort because they delivered nothing whatsoever .
negative	i '_ve never had to wait that long for cartridges from anywhere_else .
negative	what a complete_waste of time and energy .
negative	i '_ve_used pcworld over the years for the simple reason there are few alternative stores close to where i live .
negative	over these years i '_ve noticed the level of customer service when you need it go from poor and uninformed , to simply atrocious and couldn_'_t - care - less .
negative	yesterday i went with my daughter who wanted to buy a lightweight laptop as she carries one about a lot .
negative	she tried to look at a macbook_air .
negative	it was taped solidly to the counter so one could not gauge its weight .
negative	all other laptops were the same or had heavy security weights on them .
negative	displays were very messy , with product specifications usually inadequate up or covered up by clutter .
negative	since they became pcworld / currys they have got worse and worse it seems to me .
negative	asking staff if it was possible to see a macbook_air which was not glued to the counter yielded a simple ' no ' other requests yielded the same answer .
negative	so my daughter will_certainly not be spending her money with them .
negative	as far as is practically possible , i nowadays buy all computer equipment at better prices , from other_sources , because a visit to pcworld is a frustrating experience just about every time .
negative	" i would give them 0_star_rating if it were possible .
negative	not a good experience at all . the worst company ever !
negative	i cancelled my contract over 0 days ago and did not receive my refund yet . i ordered camera lens on 00th of april ............
negative	as a business i would recommend that no one use carphone_warehouse for business contracts .
negative	they do not provide the same offers for businesses , yet charge more the privaledge .
negative	my experience of this company is awful ... take a look at this transcript from the emails i '_ve been getting ...
negative	this was the last comment they sent
negative	hi , as you state we will need to issue you with a full_refund which i will see to for you .
negative	as per the same regulations that you are quoting , i have 00 days to issue you with the refund so i '_ll take care of that for you .
negative	merry_christmas .
negative	they know they have to issue a refund but would leave me out of pocket rather_than deal with it at the last moment .
negative	if you want reliability and honesty then dont ' use frangrancedirect . com
negative	having a third_party delivery your goods is seldom a good experience .
negative	add that fact they go missing for a week with no contact , then get various assurances of re delivery to all be dashed when finally the two rudest operatives arrive late on a friday_evening to slag off their job in front of a client then be rude to the client really re defines poor service .
negative	however , if you are prepared to offset service with good quality and well priced products , them order away at victoria_plumb .
negative	oh and if you are a trade customer such as i , they ( customer_services ) only work until 00 : 00 not later as their colleagues do in the retail side .
negative	never before have i spoke to customer service agents who argue on the phone then realise they are wrong and try to apologies !!!!
negative	worst customer service ever !!
negative	!
negative	won_'_t recommend this to anyone
negative	i live in glasgow where ryanair are the only company to provide budget_air travel .
negative	they have the monopoly and force any other_companies out .
negative	the prices of the flights are over_inflated .
negative	i have family in italy and it is cheaper for me to travel indirect ( via london )
negative	why does ryanair want me to lose two_days travelling ?
negative	surely 0 flight should cost less_than 0 ?
negative	also , earlier this year i used ryanair to travel to barcelona .
negative	one of my friend decided a few_days before that he would join us .
negative	the prices were hiked up by hundreds of pounds and he couldn_'_t make it .
negative	the flight was only 0 / 0 filled , they could have let him on for nothing .
negative	that was the last time i will use ryanair .
negative	i could rant on forever , i havent even started on the comfort , flying experience or general quality of service .
negative	this is supposed to be a budget_airline but i see no value for money
negative	i got hacked almost_immediately and really isn_'_t there something better to be doing them announcing what mundane activity you ' re doing now .
negative	get a life !
negative	!
negative	ordered dog_food expected delivery in a couple of days , like last order .
negative	they emailed about the order would take about two_weeks to arrive .
negative	i phoned in after about a week , and was told it was on its way !
negative	still nothing after two_days .
negative	i eventually after five_minutes getting through to somebody was told there was a problem , i did recieve in another couple days .
negative	very dissapointed in customer_services .
negative	i sent via_tnt three packs of wood all in their original packs to uk flooring direct .
negative	the goods were fine when i sent them off , except for a bit of flimsy cellophane which had come off .
negative	uk flooring direct initially refused the goods .
negative	i organised for the goods to be taken after discussing the cellophane so that a 000_pound refund could be made .
negative	the goods sat in the tnt depot for 0_weeks and in the meantime the packaging was desecrated .
negative	after about a month the package was finally delivered and uk flooring direct said that the state of the packaging was so bad that the packs were in pieces .
negative	i have not been given a refund by uk fd and not received a refund for this none existent service from interparcel .
negative	after being referred by a colleague i decided to give this musclefood a go , i placed my first order and entered the ‘ hidden code ’ provided by my colleague , the offer was ; i would get 0 . 00kg of chicken_breast and he would get £ 0 off his next order .
negative	when the food arrived the ice had ( just i think ) which i did not complain_about , i looked out for the extra chicken which did not arrive .
negative	i ’ ve placed a second order a week_later with the musclefood hoping it would appear on the second order , this was not the case .
negative	i contacted musclefood , i received a very poor response advising that i had to enter the code into the special promotions box for which i replied back that it is exactly_what i have done , i received a call a few hours_later advising that i would not receive the extra chicken_breast as i did not enter the code , when i challenged it the advisor suggested that it was my fault and i should have been more careful when processing my first order .
negative	it was not so much about the 000g of chicken it was more in regards to the way it has_been handled , i would have spent close to £_000 a month -> £ 0000 a year on chicken through musclefood . com and they waved it off for the sake of £ 0 in chicken value .
negative	i live in keyingham and the coverage is shit .
negative	i come to hull and it '_s shit .
negative	i have an ee contract and it '_s brilliant .
negative	why does my phone struggle to even get 0g ?
negative	where to start .
negative	firstly , speed checker on talk_talk '_s website provided an absurdly optimistic speed estimate for my area ( hither green , london ) presumably due to a software error .
negative	i ordered their standard broadband package expecting a service fast enough to do all the usual things you ' d expect from the internet in 0000 , streaming hd_video , having more than a couple of devices hooked up etc .
negative	anyway , we end up getting only 0 . 0mb down the line , the same speed i got on broadband a good 00 year_ago .
negative	the house is in zone 0 in london so geography can '_t be a problem , surely .
negative	anwyay , we made the call to upgrade to fibre and arranged over the phone for an engineer to make the installation on 00rd september and my flatmate booked the day off work to be there for the installation .
negative	00rd rolls around and no engineer shows up .
negative	phoned talk_talk and they say there '_s no record of anyone coming to make the installation and we ' d have to rebook another appointment ... the nearest one being 0_weeks away on 0rd october .
negative	admittedly , we never received email confirmation of the engineer appointment , but the south_african talktalk customer service agent in early september did confirmed the installation time and date several_times over the phone .
negative	things get ridiculous here as the talktalk customer service representative then books me an appointment on the 0rd without waiting for me to confirm that that was ok .
negative	i '_m in germany with work that day so i ask her to change it to 0th_october when i have a day off work .
negative	this was 00 seconds after she ' d made the booking but apparently it was too late and i ' d have to wait 00_hours to rebook a more suitable time .
negative	i made the point that i doubted the date i actually had available would be free then but apparently there was nothing she could do about it .
negative	at this point , i ' d had enough so i called customer_services who said they could put a note on the file to make provisions for compensation / credit but that i wouldn_'_t be able to phone and sort this out until the bloody fibre service was installed .
negative	the employee couldn_'_t confirm the quantum of the compensation and the fibre '_s still not installed so who_knows_how much this will end up being .
negative	then i tried to reschedule the fibre appointment 0 times this week via the talktalk website only to receive error messages that the service was unavailable and to try again later .
negative	finally call the ( premium_rate ) phone line to book another appointment and the earliest date available is now 00th_october .
negative	what a surprise .
negative	so now i have to take a day off work in addition to the pointless day my flatmate has already wasted , adding up to c . £_000 of missed salary / holiday time .
negative	long_story_short , save_yourself the hassle and go with bt or virgin .
negative	this company are a joke and obviously staff_members write most of there reviews .
negative	had major problems with a mobile_phone , was told to return it , dpd turn_up to collect the phone , i no_longer had the box for the phone , dpd were asked if the phone was fine on its own and i got told yes .
negative	now get told by utility_warehouse that phone was broken in transit and they will not be replacing it because in there opinion i did not box the phone !!!
negative	learn something from this folks , when this company mess up they will not take responsibilty .
negative	as an ex courier when a customer hands me an item , i and the company are then responsible for that item and it is then covered by the courier insurance liability .
negative	customer loyalty mean nothing to this company even taking into account i have 0 phones from this company and pay £_00 per_month for a shit service .
negative	be aware people because i for one will be taking this to consumer advice , trading_standards and will also be letting everyone know on review sites what this company are really like when things go_wrong .
negative	i recently had enough of intermittent internet and decided to move isp .
negative	i telephoned the number on there website which they state " if you require a mac_code please telephone ........", to be told we do not deal or issue mac codes so just tell your new provider that you do not need one .
negative	three_days_later i received a termination letter telling_me that as i had applied to a new isp they would now be disconnecting my phone and broadband , even_though i am paid up to date .
negative	be very careful when moving to a new isp as this crowd dont_know the meaning of the word smooth_transition !!!!!!!
negative	my advice , dont go with them in the first place .
negative	im tired of online site when they updated after you pay them for something which is out of stock
negative	one star but should be less !
negative	this must be one of the worse companies out there .
negative	i ordered a pair of boots which were " in stock " two_days_later i get an email_saying they are refunding as they are out of stock and my money will be refunded in three_days , so what with the weekend this gives them and interest free loan for a week .
negative	i emailed them as they still show as being in stock and they offer me 00_%_off my next purchase of non sale stock .
negative	and still they show as i '_m writing this as being in stock .
negative	do not order from here it is all an excuse to expand their data_base and spam you !
negative	i wanted to book 0 rooms and ended_up with just 0 , thank_goodness expedia helped out with the other 0 .
negative	i will use them in future .
negative	don_'_t order if you expect next_day delivery , they will take your money and you will wait longer_than the next_day .
negative	customer service department could not tell us any information_regarding delivery , dispatch or where order was .
negative	phone took an age to be answered , in all not very good .
negative	flowers delivered to wrong_address .
negative	and if not for the kindness of the neighbour dropping them off i am not sure if i would have received the flowers that day .
negative	to add to that the personalised card was ripped and torn .
negative	on arrival back from our holiday we discovered that we had parked in the mid term as_opposed to the long_term , which we had booked . the lady at the kiosk told us our error and we insisted on seeing her manager . she was not very helpful but did reluctantly agree to call her . when the woman came and explained it to us , i was very angry with her attitude . we were angry with having to pay an extra £_00 on top of the £_000 we had paid for 0 cars , but i have to say far angrier with her rude and obnoxious and patronising manner . i did not write to you about the incident as she made it very clear that you the b . a . a .
negative	would not care about my mistake and never give back money , even if a genuine mistake had occurred . i left that place vowing never to return to be subjected to a person of her low standards .
negative	ordered the goods as i thought it was a good deal .
negative	however goods aren_'_t in stock and delivery is approx 0 to 00 weeks - a good job my holiday wasn_'_t immediate .
negative	plus i also got spammed and can '_t remember signing_up for email and you can '_t unsubscribe .
negative	i wish i ' d kept my money for jan sales !
negative	took over a month for parts to arrive after 0 + telephone_calls .
negative	told every time that the parts would arrive the next_day .
negative	they just tell you a story to pacify you and get you off the phone .
negative	terrible
negative	0 days late on collection .
negative	no apology , no refund .
negative	just a rude women on the end of a phone basically saying its not her problem .
negative	don_'_t trust
negative	i ordered a pair of headphones on 00 / 00 / 00 , delivery 0 - 0 working_days .
negative	still not here today ( 00 / 00 / 00 ).
negative	every contact results in a different reason for the delay , and today , when i asked for my money back , i was told i ' d have to wait 00 days as per t &_c '_s .
negative	when i asked to speak to a manager i was given a different number to call , which is not answered after 00_mins on hold .
negative	i am_disgusted with the lack of any attempt to sort_out this problem , as they are still showing as in stock for 0 - 0 day delivery .
negative	also when i ordered i chose to checkout as a guest , but they created an account for me anyway , showing total_disregard for my choice .
negative	i would not recommend purchasing anything from this site unless you want to spend hours hanging on the phone or days ( 0 to be precise !)
negative	waiting for a ' fast response '
negative	wae_+ order no : order # 000 - 000 - 0000
negative	extended_warranty wouldn_'_t cover a head gasket failure ( common fault ).
negative	they took my money straight_away , then i tried to track the order , there was no sign of it .
negative	then i was told the product got damaged in transit .
negative	after 0_weeks of e_- mails , phone_calls and threats , i finally got my money back .
negative	i would never use them again !
negative	order sent 00 feb , payment taken from card , followed up email , still heard_nothing .......
negative	i just had my licence renewal through ,,, it seems the bbc in an effort to save_money will no_longer be sending out tv licences ,, they just keep on record the fact you have paid ,, now that is the ultimate in bad customer service ,,
negative	i thought it was expensive before when i got just a piece of paper for £_000 ,, now it seems i will no_longer get the piece of paper ,
negative	does anyone know a way of getting round the system of licences ?
negative	?
negative	we bought tachodisc software and installed it on a pc which unfortunately died ,
negative	tachodisc will not re - licence the software even_though it is being installed on the same computer with a new hard_drive ,,, they insist we buy the software again ,, i seriously doubt that is going to happen
negative	un completed / or half information not saying full information , ones you brought deal with only half information , you will nothing left_behind then cray , even you can '_t cancel the deal this that want tell you on first
negative	do not use this site unless you are very sure good luck
negative	the collection never happened >>???
negative	what am i paying for >??
negative	?
negative	obviously this interparcel is a unwise choice , the advisor i spoke to sam , managed to refund me .
negative	at_least sams service was better_than anything_else that is on offer from interparcel .
negative	clearly people like sam are way to genuine and should not be working for interparcel , because sam is way better_than such a poor performance company .
negative	thanks sam
negative	porque sera uma propaganda enganosa no site tem a foto do mesmo quando comprei meu fone ( 000 ) 000 0000 0000
negative	nilson schadeck
negative	took my money and dumped the flowers in a busy street .
negative	failed to respond at all when i contacted them for an explanation .
negative	avoid .
negative	after receiving a refund ( for a significant_amount ) from a item brought on ebay , i waited for the usual 0 - 0 working_days for the amount to clear back into my account during this time it displayed as pending .
negative	on the 0th day the amount had still not cleared and all records of the transaction had disappeared from my account .
negative	i phoned them immediately only to be told that your transaction has_been ' lost ' during a technical_error and we don_'_t know when you '_ll receive it .
negative	it is now over 00 days since the transaction and i am still without my refund , if this had occurred with my bank or credit_card company the monies would have been refunded straight_away .
negative	i am pretty sure this is in breach of fsa regulations .
negative	so avoid if you can but seeing though they ' re weaved into almost every online shop its not that easy !
negative	advertise as giving more than other related sites ... for a reason ... it ’_s a lie .... then have to pay 00 pound to get phone back .... didn_’_t know a stamp cost that much nowadays !
negative	- have to remove bad comments as well to get it back .... cant insult the bozowi system .. think they may be based in north korea ... thanks for asking me to give feedback !... see if this get posted this time .. or just positive ones as normal ..
negative	ordered a bouquest of flowers for my mother for mothers_day 00 . 00 . 00 .
negative	got an email at 00 : 00 stating " we regret to inform you that delivery has not been possible on the date you selected !
negative	however we are happy to rearrange for delivery as quickly as possbile , including an upgrade to your order at our cost , by way of apology for the late delivery .
negative	of course you are welcome to choose to cancel your order and we will refund you in full ."
negative	i paid a £ 0 . 00 extra delivery charge to get them there for mothers_day .
negative	they havent even offered to refund that part and still deliver the flowers .
negative	this seems to just be a scam company offering next_day delivery fot mothers_day .
negative	they take your hard_earned_money then send you an email and deliver the flowers when they feel like it .
negative	not happy
negative	i have used other online flowers companies in the past and had no_problems .
negative	i certainly wont be using eflorist again and i will be telling everyone who will listen to me to avoid them .
negative	please reply eflorist ?
negative	even better phone me ?
negative	i booked the wrong date thanks to a confusing web_site and when i called to explain .
negative	i was told sorry nothing we can do .
negative	so money down the drain
negative	customers beware .
negative	they cannot get anything right
negative	i would only use this airline as a last_resort !
negative	people rely_on being_able to get hold of me - today '_s and friday '_s network and website outages are terrible .
negative	hours of call and text outage is almost_unheard of these days .
negative	giffgaff need a more resilient model and should think about whether their model is capable of offering a professional , resilient service .
negative	i '_m leaving for one of the major providers .
negative	shame that the packaging stated who the goods inside we ' re from .
negative	didn_'_t see " as a gift " tick_box on checkout .
negative	this company will give you an attractive offer to make_sure that they get , in my case my phone , and when they get it they will drastically lower the value of the offer .
negative	this will be lower_than what you will be guaranteed off far better known and reputable_companies .
negative	they will allow you to get the product back but will charge you for this so you will feel , like i did , backed into a corner to accept or face losing money by paying for your property back .
negative	yes i got a revised_offer , but an insult with and extra £ 0 .
negative	would have had an extra £_00 on top of this if i hadn_'_t gone with this company .
negative	my advice would be avoid this company .
negative	stated on their website under " our promise " is that you can contact [_name_] the md via_email if you ’ re not satisfied ; don_'_t bother you won_'_t get a response .
negative	i will not use this company again and will never recommend them .
negative	terrible customer service and the worst i have ever_experienced .
negative	i paid 0 . 00 for a sony_xperia case , wrong one was sent to me .
negative	i didn_'_t chase them up on this , because it cost me 0 . 00 and postage would probably cost me more .
negative	i '_m very disappointed as this was meant to be one of the gifts for my brother '_s birthday .
negative	delivery not yet recived ?
negative	all phones wer workin wen i sent them then uz e_- mailed 0 say 0 wernt workin total crap all wer checked b0 bn sent
negative	their tracking stated my parcel would be delivered on the 0th_jan .
negative	i waited in all day and they never turned_up !
negative	so i tried_calling their customer service and after getting past the automated stuff i waited on hold for 00_minutes .
negative	i gave up in the end !
negative	i tried again the next_day and got through after 00_minutes - to be told " oh i guess something went wrong - nothing we can do except reschedule "
negative	i wasted one day and now have to hope they can be_arsed to deliver on monday .
negative	when things go ok its fine .
negative	but the delivery company they use now - the terrible city_link - failed to deliver on the day they said .
negative	i ' d waited in all day as the tracking said it was out for delivery but they never turned_up .
negative	i tried_calling city_link and after a 00 minute wait i finally got through to be told " oh i guess something went wrong - sometimes that happens ".
negative	gee great !
negative	not great - i wasted a whole day in and will now waste another day in the hope they deliver this time .
negative	i contacted gjw_titmuss but my past experience is when things go_wrong they are useless .
negative	having said that when things go ok its fine .
negative	purchased a radiator through ring and reserve .
negative	one of the boxes looked slightly_damaged , got it home to find there was no fixings with it , and they had been removed .
negative	rang the store ( loughborough ), got cut_off .
negative	rang again , and got cut_off after being on hold and talking to someone at the store .
negative	rang the following_day to ask the parts be posted to me - only a small_packet .
negative	was told i ' d have to wait_until a manager turned_up after 00am as a member of staff couldn_'_t post anything , and " why don_'_t you just come in ?"
negative	after ringing a few_times , emailing and getting_nowhere i went into store to get the missing pieces .
negative	no apology , and a 00 mile_round_trip and time off work for me so i had the parts in time for the arrival of the plumber .
negative	won_'_t be buying anything from b_& q now , sticking to screwfix and wickes .
negative	having navigated to a co . uk site , i instantly assumed that my order would be processed and desptached from the uk .
negative	the channel_islands at a push ...
negative	the problem was i ordered a birthday card , the p_&_p rates being a little high , but not high enough to arouse my suspicion about where the damn_thing would be despatched from .
negative	i even allowed an extra 00 days from order date before i needed the card .
negative	suffice to say , it '_s 0_weeks_later and no sign of the card .
negative	a close_inspection ( and i mean close ) reveals that orders from the . co . uk site are sent from california .
negative	as a result , my order is irrelevant , and that '_s £ 0 wasted .
negative	the card still_hasn_'_t arrived either .
negative	would not use again .
negative	the only smooth part of the whole_transaction was the efficient transfer of money from my account to theirs .
negative	ordered ( and paid ) for tickets 0 months prior to the concert and i had to chase them all the way right up to the day of the concert to find where the tickets where .
negative	a believe me they do not make it easy to contact them .
negative	in the end they told ( not asked ) me to collect the tickets from the venue .
negative	when i got to the venue they knew that ticketweb had sold a number of tickets but had not been told who had what seats despite emailing them for the information .
negative	out of frustration i asked ticketweb if they would be refunding the ' delivery ' cost considering they did not deliver them and i collected them and was told ' unfortunately , we are unable to refund your handling as the collection charge is the same cost as the delivery charge '.
negative	so be warned the service charge is a levy applied for the privilege of receiving such a sterling ' customer service experience '.
negative	poor quality printing , followed_by endless offer emails .
negative	the control worked extremely well for approximately three_weeks then packed up .
negative	iflorist have delivered the wrong flowers !
negative	i ordered a purple bouquet for my wife ( her_favourite colour ) which was supposed to have purple roses within it .
negative	whilst it arrived today on time , the flowers are completely_different to my order and to me they don_'_t look to be in the freshest state .
negative	when i emailed their cusomer service department to request a refund i am told that their terms and conditions_state that they can change the flowers for another set of the higher or same value in the instance that they run out of the ordered bouquet .
negative	well if what they delivered is the same or better , then i '_m a monkeys uncle !
negative	my suggestion is to avoid this lot .
negative	their customer service team also seems to be based overseas which in my experience is not not conducive to a good business .
negative	i '_m still arguing for my refund , so_far i have only been offered another bouquet .
negative	i will post back if i do get a refund or further experiences .
negative	i ordered a bag from website that implied it was in stock .
negative	it wasn_'_t and would take 0 - 0_weeks to deliver .
negative	they then took a few_days to reply to my e_- mail about an_alternative .
negative	this was also available on the website but i then had an e_- mail back to say this was not in stock and would take 0 - 0_weeks to deliver .
negative	i have subsequently asked for my money back which again has not had a reply .
negative	absolutely abysmal service , communication and overall experience .
negative	after i rejected bozowi '_s new offer , which suddenly was a lot lower_than first agreed for my iphone ,( basically they changed their offer once they had my phone ).
negative	i wrote a review sharing my concerns .
negative	bozowi did not like this and so they have threatened to sue me and have kept my phone and refused to respond to my emails .
negative	why you ask ?
negative	simple , i refused to allow them to rip me off !!!!!!!!!!!
negative	i have informed trading_standards and bbc_watchdog .
negative	use bozowi at your own_peril ........... you have been_warned !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
negative	!
negative	avoid auracall as their landline deal is terrible value .
negative	they have it in the small_print that their option 0 only allows 000 inclusive call minutes .
negative	yet their website misleads you by comparing their prices with bt and talktalk who allow unlimited minutes in their call allowance .
negative	they start charging for their call package even before your line is switched to them !
negative	customer service chooses to answer or not emails .
negative	they answer easy emails and ignore difficult ones !
negative	bought a 0 . 00 item from them tempted by the cheap price but as they say you gets what you pay for and in my case that was nothing but a pile of extra work .
negative	wasn_'_t chasing the order but some 0 days after i received an email asking about there service i emailed them saying hard to review when order has not arrived .
negative	they then after many to and fro emails send me a form to claim of royal_mail .. how on earth can i do that as i have no idea if they actually sent the item when i said it would be easier than filling that form in to contact my card company they then said we will charge you any fees your card company charge us as we have you card_details anyway my card company were not so impressed by that as you can_imagine
negative	my company ordered several chairs from office_furniture and after a while the arm
negative	rests started to crack and break up .
negative	have called several_times to order replacements and no one ever calls me back to let_me know what '_s happening .
negative	it '_s been six_months now since first call and am giving up hope this will ever be sorted
negative	all i ever get is i will look into it but they don_'_t ,
negative	we are happy to pay for new ones but still no calls or updates from company .
negative	i joined lovefim back in 0000 and was proud of my cost saving i made against video stores and the whole family benefited_from the membership .
negative	nowadays newer titles are taking longer and longer to become_available .
negative	the amazon website is excruciating to use , the streaming content has many titles that are charged for in addition to the streaming subscription charge , amazon made seperate charges for the streaming service and billed another credit_card for which they had the details for from purchases i had made from them in the past which is outrageous ( i wasn_'_t notified of this and only found out by chance ).
negative	i have looked for an_alternative service and cinema paradiso fits the bill ( they even have up to date titles ) however the service i want costs £_00 per_month and now i have netflix which would take me over budget .
negative	so for now netflix will be the beneficiary of amazon and lovefilm '_s loss .
negative	for eight_years it was a great little service but now it seems that they no_longer care , shame .
negative	despite several e_- mails beforehand , when i placed my order on - line i did not recieve goods .
negative	after a week i phoned up to find they are out of stock .
negative	no - one contacted me to tell me this , i had to find out for myself .
negative	no delivery date has_been given for the arrival of goods despite a promise to e_mail me that day with a delivery date .
negative	if i had known the goods were not in stock i would not have placed the order .
negative	all in all , rubbish !
negative	the boats ok , exactly_what you would expect from a cross_channel ferry .
negative	the outbound trip went_according to plan .
negative	now for the return trip
negative	the customer service at dunkirk was good and our premium ticket came into play and we on an earlier boat - so_far so good .
negative	we were both tired and went sit_down for a bit before making the mistake of going to cafeteria .
negative	we chose our food from the fair selection of food available and the met the worst till operator i have ever had the misfortune to come_across .
negative	even the low_cost supermarkets who are clear its price and not service don_'_t put anyone with such limited social skills loose on the public .
negative	my wife asked if we could pay in euros to which this beauty agreed after sighing and casting her eyes to the ceiling .
negative	my wife tendered the correct amount in notes and made an unforgivable error in handing the sweet lady a non euro coin from her collection of euros , litas or polish money .
negative	the operator from hell flicked a backhand across the loose change and uttering something to the effect " at_least make_sure you are using the right money " there was no one else in the queue to delay so we couldn_'_t be accuse of slowing the money taking operation !
negative	at this point i had had enough and intervened saying something like " whoa we are tired from travelling and don_'_t need to treated_like this when all we have done is try to pay for our food ."
negative	my wife is suffering from inoperable cancer and cannot stand stress so the girl in question is lucky because i just let it go , i then heard her on 0 separate_occasions relating the incident to her colleagues totally misrepresenting the occurrence .
negative	i found this distasteful and it made me and my wife very uncomfortable .
negative	with healthy competition on the cross_channel ferries i am struggling for a reason to use that company again and not to tell my fellow_travellers that there are nicer people on these competitive routes .
negative	two drop cards from this courier left in letterbox .
negative	no details of local_depot where collection of shipment could be made , no details on website , no adequate feedback system upon which i can leave further instructions regarding alternative delivery arrangement , premium_rate telephone service and yes , they do keep you on hold .
negative	very poor service compared to the other courier services who are more then happy to help .
negative	not recommended at all .
negative	they set themselves a low standard and fail to achieve it .
negative	i was with vodaphone for two years with an htc_desire and never had any_issues or reason to complain and everything was great .
negative	so when i needed to upgrade i didn_'_t really need to go_anywhere_else .
negative	i went to a lovely store in stratford '_s westfield and sat down for a good half hour looking at the upgrade options and phones and bought another htc - a one s .
negative	here is the first problem : i was taking about wanting to watch tv and the guy said i could watch sky_sports and showed me the app on his phone .
negative	i thought this was fantastic as a sky sport customer and sports fanatic .
negative	i got home and found the skygo app doesn_'_t work on the htc one s .
negative	not one to complain , i looked at the benefits of the phone and still felt satisfied with the deal they gave_me and that the phone suited me .
negative	then a couple of weeks_ago it went mad and kept flicking between screens .
negative	i had to close it down and restart to fix it .
negative	it happened again and this time after shutting the phone down , it wouldn_'_t restart .
negative	as i was out and waiting for a call from a friend i needed to get it working so i fiddled and fiddled and tried everything and after about 00mins of pushing this that and the other it came back to life .
negative	after a week of putting up with the screen flicking issue i had the same problem with restarting phone and i took it to my local_store in lewisham .
negative	a very helpful chap had a fiddle , looked on line for similar complaints , was just about to give up and then it came back to life again .
negative	we then agreed it should go for repair and off it went .
negative	i got no replacement phone and the guy gave_me a mobile number to call the store on and suggested i leave it a week or so .
negative	again , not being one to complain , i left the store with no phone hoping for the best .
negative	i called a week_later and it went through to answerphone , i left a message and got a call back minutes later .
negative	i spoke to a chap_who said he would look in the box for it .
negative	no joy .
negative	so he told me to call again on friday .
negative	i called on friday and it went through to answerphone .
negative	i left a message .
negative	no response .
negative	called again , no answer ... and again ... and again .
negative	then monday , no answer , left message , no call , rang again , no answer , again , no answer .
negative	and here i am , no phone , and no way of finding out if it '_s fixed .
negative	i tried_calling customer_services and got through to a call_centre somewhere in the world and the guy was of no help whatsoever .
negative	finally , i made some progress via the online_chat service , where a person called jobin was able to help and told me that the phone is back at lewisham , but that they were unable to find a fault - even_though the sales_guy in the store was unable to turn the phone on either .
negative	two_weeks of no phone , having to call and chase them to find out what '_s going on and for what , nothing - i get the same broken phone back .
negative	so presumably i now have to claim on my insurance and get it replaced ?
negative	so , in summary , nice stores and nice salesmen , but no support .
negative	i would have thought they could have given me a spare phone - they are supposed to be a premium retailer .
negative	this kind of half baked offering and lack of communication is no different from cheap online stores - so you may as well save_yourself the money !
negative	too much messing_around to use them and constant e_- mails have unsubscribed but still get get them
negative	they still owe me money , refuse to answer my letters break promises to repay me , break promises to come_back to me .
negative	i could go on but what is the point
negative	i don_’_t know much about pc ’_s so i used their remote page to identify my memory type and bought same in good faith .
negative	the memory arrived in good time and was well_packed but a totally different type !
negative	i have written to them twice with no reply .
negative	philjonez @_hotmail . com
negative	the company is based here :
negative	mr tong
negative	# 0 - 00 hanhai building
negative	zhongshan road
negative	yuzhong district
negative	chongqing
negative	china
negative	the products received are fakes .
negative	i was charged in chinese yen , then incurred bank charges and different currency rate , then charged import_duty of £_00 .
negative	all of this was refunded .
negative	then the clubs arrived and they were both the incorrect clubs ordered and poor quality and fakes .
negative	i am settling via visa claimback .
negative	although the dispute is still open and the company keeps contacting me for return of the clubs .
negative	the costs of which would be £_00
negative	ordered and checked status which said completed on 00 / 0 / 00 .
negative	no sign of goods .
negative	when queried with customer service they said that one of the items ordered had been msidentified and was not in stock but never mind they would source it from somewhere_else and let_me know .
negative	no further contact and no items delivered .
negative	would i use them again ?
negative	would you ?
negative	offered free dollar card , which i accepted as i was due to go to the us in about 0 - 0_weeks on holiday .
negative	nothing arrived after 00 working_days , so i phoned them up .
negative	told i should have got an email about a problem they had with their promotional_offer website .
negative	sent me the email again ( as i did not get the 0st one ) and when i received it i had to re - apply again .
negative	still no card arrived .
negative	i rang several_times ; was always told it would be looked into and i would get a call back .
negative	got no calls and no card .
negative	then on the day before my departure the card arrived ................. too late as i had been forced to go to another company who responded in 00_hrs !
negative	!
negative	ace - fx are rubbish ; and i shall never deal with them again .
negative	we spent over £_000 on flowers with you and every rose ..... has died within three_days .
negative	could you please explain this ?
negative	we had two orders , 000000000 arrived looking beautiful but over half have had to be thrown_away .
negative	order 000000000 the entire £_00 of roses was dead within two_days and the other bunch resembled a garage bunch if i '_m honest and nothing like picture .
negative	the vase was beautiful and very good value and the chocolates were delicious but i '_m afraid we most definitely will not be using this service again .
negative	i will send photos of my pitiful flowers !
negative	i purchased a 0 day delivery but it took them 0 days , i called there help line on 00th_june at 00 :_00pm they promised me a refund as a goodwill within 0 days , they have failed twice on their promise 0 day delivery slot and another for a refund
negative	been with vodafone for around 00 years ...
negative	moved to orange .
negative	because vodafone ignored my request to stop marketing .. vodafone broke so many rules .
negative	data_protection act etc .. was sick of vodafone had to write to there ceo and was released out of my contract .
negative	also there customer_services is none excistant ..
negative	buyer_beware
negative	the call_centre fails to deal with the most basic of enquiries .
negative	avoid at all costs .
negative	i ordered something from them having seen their website states 0 - 0 working_days delivery at a cost of £ 0 . 00 .
negative	i paid by paypal and had no comfimation from advance tec besides the automated paypal email .
negative	0 working_days_later , no parcel .
negative	i emailed but got no reply , i called twice and the first time i was told the courier would email me , the second one said that it had been despatched but couldn_'_t give me the details .
negative	i don_'_t think my parcel is going to come and suspect i will have to report paypal .
negative	either way , i wouldn_'_t ever shop with them again , truly_terrible company .
negative	worst customer service ever !
negative	they have completely messed_up my dual_fuel account and have been giving empty_promises to resolve the issue for around 0 months !!
negative	most efforts to contact them fail !
negative	kept on hold for 00 + minutes and then cut_off .
negative	when they do phone you they still dont resolve problem !
negative	although my account shows a credit balance of over £_000 i get debt_collection_agency calls and letters !
negative	what are they doing ?
negative	do they know ?!
negative	failed to call me back again today and they appear to not understand what i am actualy complaining_about !
negative	will have to swap suppliers some time soon as a priority !
negative	used in the past and flowers delivered very late ( days ), did find out till long time after so left it .
negative	just ordered more flowers , giving them a second chance and used the before_noon service at extra_cost , flowers turned_up near 0 hours late !
negative	flowers them self are ok , but the delivery is terrible , will not use again
negative	this is the worst company ever !!
negative	i want to cut my contract with t - mobile as they don_'_t give you your moneys_worth .
negative	i have been with t - mobile for several_years_now i these problem that are occurring seem to becoming more frequent meaning every other day for the last 0 months .
negative	normally you would get full network when your in a open space but on the other handy my network_coverage is always being cut_off .
negative	sometimes i cant make a phone_call because there '_s something wrong with the server .
negative	my phone_calls always being cut mid way through a important to professional people or just general conversations to my friends .
negative	and then at the end of the month t - mobile then want to charge me a ridiculous_amount of money for my monthly plan that i haven_'_t even been able to you use to the full extent .
negative	t - mobile , you are ripp offs we should compensated for are losses and inconveniences !!
negative	there customer service is just as bad with there rude members off staff that don_'_t even seem to bothered to help you when your asking for a little assistants , and most of them cant even speak understandable english with there heavy accents , because it seems like i speaking to someone on the other side of the world .
negative	and don_'_t think when it comes to the end of my contract i will hesitate to leave your useless company !
negative	!
negative	if you can be bother to get back to me ( which i doubt ), email me on ; samanthajs0 @_yahoo ,. com
negative	miss samantha .
negative	waited all day for delivery .
negative	then checked their website which had previously said " out for delivery " to see it had been amended to delivery attempted .
negative	i had been waiting in all day , no one called , no card left !
negative	used your service to order flowers firstly the site wasn_'_t up to date with the credit_card_details input only running to 0000 but then i made mistake of presuming that the order date was set for the same day , i could have phoned one of a dozen shops befor twelve and got flowers there the same day .
negative	so flowers arrived to wife '_s place of work when she wasn_'_t there .
negative	tuff i know but the worst of it is she has them now and they are pathetic a big box with a tiny bunch of flowers wrapped in a bone_dry paper towel .
negative	tuff again i was thinking but no i '_ve taken the photo off you website and one of what you sent i trading_standards tell me i will get a case number and i will be wanting a refund .
negative	wanted me to post them proof of my address before processing my order as an " additional security_measure " - and i had to wait 00_mins in their phone queue for the privilege of finding that out .
negative	daft in so many ways , but most of all what kind of master criminal would want to order a tv , pay for it in full and then get it delivered to someone_else '_s house ?
negative	this is a terrible comany .
negative	after promising immediate delivery nothing has_been heard of from them in the last three_weeks .
negative	the telephone is not answered and they do not reply to e_- mails .
negative	i suppose my money is lost and i will have to look_elsewhere for the product .
negative	i could perhaps take legal_action .
negative	they do not deserve the one star_rating that i have given them
negative	i could not urge_anyone stronger against using this shameful company !
negative	despite sending a fully working device , i was emailed to say that my device was actually not working and i would receive a very small_percentage of that quoted when i sent the device .
negative	i immediately contacted fonebank to dispute this , to which the member of the team i spoke to proceeded to perform a number of checks on the handset to confirm it indeed did not work , much to my dismay .
negative	i was still unhappy at this and had the device returned , only to find that it was not my handset !
negative	mine had a small scratch in a very distinct position on the screen - this one didn_'_t .
negative	after a number of phone_calls more , and me threatening them with the involvement of trading_standards they eventually gave in and gave_me my originally_quoted figure .
negative	i '_m glad i stayed strong , yet i fear they will try this stunt with other people !
negative	worst customer service ever_experienced !
negative	i made a substantial order to restock all my cat_food for a few_months .
negative	a bozita cat_food box weighs 000gms & there are 00 boxes in a case .
negative	i ordered 0 of these cases along with 0 of each of whiskas anti - hairball , whiskas temptations & whiskas katzinis .
negative	the containers for the whiskas items are very thin & weak & therefore should not be packed with an item weighing 0 . 0kg ( weight of a bozita cat_food case ), as anybody with common_sense would know that the whiskas containers would break & damage the contents .
negative	well someone_who had no common_sense did just this !
negative	they packed 0 whiskas containers with a case of bozita cat_food .
negative	this resulted_in the whiskas containers being smashed into tiny shards & the contents to granules , not to mention the amount of cleaning up i was left to do !
negative	i therefore contacted pet_supermarket by email in the 0nd week of january .
negative	i received a couple of emails to find out if i still had the remains of the damaged goods & with every email i received i responded .
negative	however , i have had no reponse whatsoever since 00 / 00 / 00 despite replying 0 times !
negative	it has now been over 0 month since i had a response .
negative	worse still 0_weeks_later ( today '_s date is 00 / 00 / 00 ) the issue has not been resolved & i have received no refund or compensation !!!
negative	!
negative	i will not be using this company ever again !
negative	their packing service it sub - standard & customer service shambolic !
negative	i suggest that others do not use pet suupermarket as you will lose money and get ripped_off !
negative	0 .
negative	i entered an online order for valentines_day roses in madrid - no confirmation_email and not able to retrieve the order online .
negative	emailed customer service about the above and got no reply .
negative	0 .
negative	next_day i put in another order - but same thing , no confirmation_email and unable to retrieve - i just left it to chance at this point .
negative	0 .
negative	on valentines_day i called madrid - 0 or 0 times , each time waited on hold ( on an international call !)
negative	for over 00_minutes - left voicemails , sent another email .
negative	0 .
negative	eventually got a call back from customer_services saying they were sorry but as themadrid florists were very busy my valentines_day flowers would not be delivered on valentines but the next_day .
negative	they were sorry and they would refund me half the cost .
negative	0 .
negative	my initial order turned_up on valentines_day !
negative	0 .
negative	my second order turned_up the next_day !
negative	0 .
negative	both sets of flowers were appalling and i am told barely lasted more than 00_hours and were chucked in the bin !
negative	conclusion_: this is so bad on so many levels - just don_'_t go there .
negative	the service i received from physioroom was absolutely diabolical
negative	the delivery was late , the goods did not appear to be brand_new , they would not pay return carriage , they took_ages to issue a refund , they asked me to scan and return my invoice ( when it was available to download on their website ), they demanded my bank_account details when i had paid by paypal
negative	sorry physioroom , i won_'_t be buying from you again .
negative	.
negative	.
negative	i ordered a television from 000 electrical , and was told at the point of order it may take 0 - 00 days to get it in stock .
negative	i was happy with this .
negative	i read the t &_c of sale , in which it said " acceptance of your order takes place when the goods leave our warehouse ."
negative	therefore they should not take payment until the goods are dispatched ( i believe this is a legal_requirement anyway ), which most reputable_companies adhere to .
negative	the of course charged my card on the same day .
negative	i emailed them to ask that they refund my card and charge it again when the goods were dispatched .
negative	the response was unhelpful , rude and obstructive .
negative	their customer service is very poor .
negative	was actually refused an account even_though i have the highest possible credit_rating .
negative	asked for explanation and was fobbed_off .
negative	wrote and sent copy of credit ratiing just to prove a point .
negative	have not even had the courtesy of a reply .
negative	my story is as follows :-
negative	interlink_express driver fraudulently signs for parcel
negative	courier given access to a block of private flats , customer appears not to be in , does not leave card but does decides to ( fraudulently ) sign for it himself and then leaves it somewhere - parcel goes missing .
negative	interlink_express couriers - all lies
negative	my local interlink depot spokesperson has told me that the courier involved , says he went back to the flats yesterday ( 00st_jan ) to investigate and sort_out with the customer but could not gain_access and that the customer was not in - completely false as the customer has_been there since sunday and is still there .
negative	i was then told that the courier left a card this time - completely false again as the customer has his own numbered letter_box , and he has just been to check this on my advice , and nothing is there .
negative	i have a contract with my customer who has purchased my goods and expects to receive these , i shall honour this and make_sure that he does .
negative	interlikexpress . com breach of contract
negative	it appears that interlink who has a legal contract with my business , are more than happy to employ staff who blatantly break the terms of this contract and then lie through their back teeth to protect themselves .
negative	they then inform_me that there is nothing further that they can do and that this is now an insurance claim , i advise them that this is not an insurance case and that this is fraud and ask what they are going to do about it , i am informed to take it up with the insurance department so the buck is passed on further and i , my business and my customer can go and get *******
negative	people beware !
negative	if you have similar stories , please share these ....
negative	i decided to use collect_plus to send a parcel to scotland .
negative	i booked my delivery and got the parcel posted straight_away .
negative	so_far so good .
negative	i followed the tracking and the item was delivered on tuesday according to records .
negative	this of course was untrue .
negative	after telephoning their_offices i was told the item had gone to the wrong_address and they were unable to recover it .
negative	this has to be the worst courier ever and i urge_everyone who is thinking of using them to think again and go back to a reliable service like royal_mail .
negative	i would also like to add that trying to claim a refund is just as bad .
negative	would it not be easier to simply credit my paypal again rather_than having me need to gather so much information and then email this to you .
negative	i am not very good with computers .
negative	you already have the tracking_number and have admitted losing the item .
negative	update .
negative	your answers to my complaints have shown just how much attention you really do pay .
negative	i am the seller and its me that is complaining .
negative	you are not in contact as you say in your statement .
negative	i have been told to fill in a complaint form and gather all the information to get my money back .
negative	you should return my money with paypal and stop messing me around .
negative	you company collect_+ really are incompetent and hte replies you are sending should be read by all future clients before they make the same mistake i did .
negative	i wanted to give no stars , but it wouldn_'_t let_me .
negative	been with homeserve for about 00 months .
negative	last winter called them out because our boiler packed up ( i '_m not a gas safe plumber ), the engineer stared at the boiler for 00_minutes then told me he didn_'_t know what the problem was , and that i should call out the manufacturer .
negative	ended_up paying manufacturer to replace a printed circuit_board .
negative	this winter the boiler started losing pressure .
negative	we called out homeserve , but while waiting i traced the fault to a leaking pipe under the floor .
negative	the engineer turned_up to find the room emptied and floor lifted for him , but refused to go under the floor to fix it claiming he had a bad neck and shoulder .
negative	he told me he would ring the office and get someone smaller / fitter to come out .
negative	later that evening we rang to find out what was going on , only to be told that nothing was happening because the engineer had reported that there was no access to the leak !
negative	whilst my wife waited on hold trying to find out what was going to happen , i went under the floor and fixed the leak myself .
negative	it took me less_than five_minutes , which isn_'_t bad considering there was " no access "!
negative	on top of this we have not had our boiler_serviced yet , even_though we were told that the service we were paying for includes an annual maintenance service .
negative	i would not recommend this company to my worst_enemy , and as far as i '_m concerned they should refund me every_penny i have paid them as they are incapable of fixing anything .
negative	i only gave one star because it wouldn_'_t let_me give none .
negative	i was with tiscali before they became talk_talk .
negative	they weren_'_t brilliant then , but since they became talk_talk they became one of the worst companies to deal with that i have ever_experienced .
negative	i had all of my services with them , needless to say that i now have none .
negative	you have been_warned !
negative	could only get 00 ish meg speed even_though paid for fibre , thay lie promise u anything to sign longer , tell u u can leave dont owe anything then threaten you with court for the cost of tv box even thogh it says free , letters from bailiffs even when you have sent box back , got the reciept , and tell them still get letters , so much stress caused made me very ill , no one needs it .. stay well clear
negative	sold non working samsung_galaxy_note for £_00 , then got email_saying that engineers had valued it at £_00 !!!
negative	and if i want it returned it would cost £_00 !!
negative	totally_unacceptable !
negative	very misleading , scamming company !!
negative	!
negative	i have paid for tickets many_times with travelup but they have now lost me as a future customer . they charged £ 0000 for a ticket on ba for a premium econ seat ( saying only 0 seats were left ) for a colleague traveling with me , having been assured this was the cheapest available . you can_imagine my shock when after my friend had paid finding on the official site for ba the same seat for £ 0000 . 00 ! this is an example of dishonest profiteering and unacceptable practice by this company . shame on them !
negative	the worst site on the internet .
negative	they support sucks they have no intrest at all .
negative	stay well clear use amazon or any other site .
negative	bewarr everybody .
negative	this company has taken payment from my account and the goods have not been delivered .
negative	it has_been over two_weeks since they took payment , and they haven_'_t replied to emails or telephone_call ever .
negative	have alerted american_express fraud_department and they are following it up , and said that necessary compensation will be sought .
negative	just wish i had read some of the reviews on here before purchasing .
negative	damaged drawers on delivery - after sending 0 0 separate incorrect drawers out in very poor packaging , it is still not resolved .
negative	would not recommend to anyone for the price paid vs hassle .
negative	the bed is comfy , but service is appalling !
negative	after 0 months we still have not had the correct replacement drawer ..
negative	very very poor .
negative	- go to ikea and save 000_quid !
negative	you have had my phone for 0 week u promised to send payment by the 0 dec still_waiting
negative	their telecommunications mast near my home broke_down in april_0000 , they new about the fault but seemed incapable or incompetent as they could not repair the mast months later .
negative	eventually they agreed to let_me exit my contract after numerous hours of arguing and frustration , and they gave_me a pac_code however they now hold me to ransom for the unlock_code for the iphone .
negative	i have just today ( 0 / 0 /_0000 ) contacted ofcom , i would recommend people stay clear of this company .
negative	my order with viovet went very smoothly .
negative	payment was made and i received my receipt immediately .
negative	i paid an additional £ 0 . 00 for guaranteed next_day delivery .
negative	i waited in all day .
negative	it did not arrive .
negative	i called viovet .
negative	they told me it would be delivered the following_day and my £ 0 . 00 would be refunded .
negative	neither happened .
negative	i was offered another delivery slot on the following working day , monday , but could neither wait nor trust that my dog_food would arrive four days after it should have so had to drive across to livingston to pick it up .
negative	city_link did not deliver to my home .
negative	my three emails to viovet did not meet a response .
negative	i am_disgusted and will never use viovet or their courier , city_link , ever again .
negative	the former are terrible , the latter are incompetent and rude in the extreme .
negative	our order did not arrive on the day after we ordered it as we expected .
negative	dan phoned me the day after to ask if we had got it .
negative	he said citylink had added the note lwn / 00 to the delivery status .
negative	citylink then phoned up to tell us that they had left it with number 00 .
negative	we were in all day on the delivery day and number 00 ( 0 doors down ) were not in at all .
negative	they just had to ring the bell at our house ( number 0 ) to deliver the goods but instead decided to put it in the porch 0 doors down !
negative	i went to investigate .
negative	number 00 were still not in but i picked_up the box of print cartridges from their porch .
negative	perhaps you should review your association with citylink and employ a delivery service with more than 0 brain cells to rub together .
negative	this companys policy on refunds is ridiculous .
negative	they do not abide_by the consumer_law .
negative	i wouldnt ever recommend them .
negative	no chance !
negative	!
negative	i would not recommend this company ever !
negative	once my contract_ends i will leave them and never return .
negative	i have had on going problems with them for over a month , my compensation for downtime from the internet was £ 0 . 00ish
negative	when i wrote in to complain_about the loss of service , which cost my business money !
negative	and alot of stress .
negative	they never responded at all .
negative	i sent my letter recorded so i know they received it .
negative	eventually got a call from an indian_call_centre , just saying sorry , and that they dont offer compensation .
negative	0 free month of subscription would of been better_than a £ 0 gesture .
negative	what a joke .
negative	shocking !!
negative	!
negative	ordering them was easy .. got delivered .....
negative	they not the colour or flowers i ordered not impressed as the person getting the hated the colour of them so i will never use again
negative	first time using affordablesupplement website and probably the last time .
negative	i ’_m disappointed with the customer service received from one of the sales_representative who wasn_’_t friendly and helpful .
negative	also i was told i was gonna get a text on the day of the delivery but i never received one .
negative	product never arrived .
negative	when i phoned to query it , was told it had been cancelled because my payment had not gone_through .
negative	paid by credit_card and it did not indicate a problem when i paid .
negative	there was loads of credit available on my account , although my account was never charged .
negative	this is not the first time this has happened with pharmaceutical companies who use a third_party payment system and deny all responsibility for it when it goes_wrong .
negative	they also said they had sent me an email_advising me of the failure , but i never received such an email - i strongly suspect none was ever sent .
negative	i ordered a pair of fitflops from this company on 00 / 00 / 00 .
negative	today ( 00 / 00 / 00 ) i '_ve finally lost_patience .
negative	i suspect they ' re simply ' boxshifters ' - if it '_s in stock , fine but if not .....
negative	the problem is they won_'_t bother to inform you of what '_s going on and they left it to me to chase them .
negative	several of my e_- mails were simply ignored but eventually i got a reply telling_me they were awaiting stock and would contact me - the problem is that they don_'_t and it '_s left to you to chase them ( again ).
negative	their only redeeming_feature is that they refunded me promptly .
negative	i was left with a promise that the ' d contact me when the goods were in stock and i could re - order but of course they don_'_t contact you ....
negative	take my advice : before ordering , check with them by phone that the item '_s in stock or better still , order from another company who actually do what they promise .
negative	postscript : shortly_after_posting the above review , the owner of shoetique contacted me to apologise .
negative	he offered to send me a free pair of fitflops if i would delete my review .
negative	to my shame , i accepted his offer , giving him my word that i would delete the review upon_receipt of the goods .
negative	he then asked that i delete the review first - this was the final_straw and did me a favour by jolting me back to reality !
negative	i '_ve declined his offer and stand by my comments .

negative	i emailed trustpiolot several days ago asking them how rigorous their procedures are in validating reviewers and to date i have not had a response .
negative	my gut tells_me trustpilot cannot be trusted .
negative	i have selected several " good reviewers " asking if they wrote their review , i '_ll let you all know what the responses are .
negative	strange this is the second time i '_ve written this i was timed out before , why would i be timed out ????
negative	?
negative	this is by far the worst on line trader i have ever_dealt_with to the point i have cancelled my order .
negative	their web_site states 0 - 0 days to process refunds , their response states 0 - 0 days .
negative	this is absolutely typical of value basket , order and money were received and 0 days_later it was still being_processed , it had not even left their warehouse , almost three_weeks_later their update was it would be processed next week .
negative	value basket cannot be trusted to deliver goods or refunds on time .
negative	web_site statement
negative	we typically take 0 - 0 days to process refunds .
negative	depending on how you paid for your original order , we always return the funds to the credit_card that you paid your order with .
negative	unfortunately the bank might take another 0 - 0 days to process the refund , so we advise that you allow 0 days for the sum to appear in your account .
negative	their response to me
negative	i ’_m sorry to hear that you ’ ve decided to cancel your order , however i can confirm that this has_been done .
negative	refunds typically take 0 - 0 business days to process from our end , depending on how you paid for your original order ( we always credit back to the same credit_card that you used for payment ).
negative	unfortunately it can sometimes take another 0 - 0 days for your bank to process the refund , so we advise that you allow 00 days for the funds to be seen in your account .
negative	the good news though is that we ’ ll send you an email to confirm when the refund has_been completed .
negative	the good new is , there is no good news from value basket .
negative	do yourself a favour and never place any orders with value basket .

negative	dear fraser ,
negative	my sincere_apologies for the delay in refunding your order .
negative	i have escalated your refund to high priority and i am confident it will be refunded very shortly .
negative	our customer service team will contact you as soon as it is completed .
negative	please do not_hesitate to contact me personally contact who personally ??????????
negative	if you have any other queries .
negative	best regards ,
negative	valuebasket . com
negative	update
negative	sincere_apologies are the mantra of value basket , they fail to deliver and offer apologies .
negative	would it not be so much_better if they learned from their mistakes and just package and send items ordered , there are so many online traders that can achieve good relations with their customers but value basket are not one of them .
negative	update
negative	everyone note how value basket do not give out deadlines they continually say things like " i am confident it will be refunded very shortly " what exactly does this mean , very shortly ?
negative	is that today , tomorrow , next week ?
negative	why is it so hard to be specific , they could have said " your refund will be processed later today and should be back in your account tomorrow " this is a credit_card transaction , if i were in a high_street shop it would be refunded immediately .
negative	update
negative	got my refund but how easy would it have been to just send out the lens and filter and none of this " bad_taste " would be left in my mouth .
negative	value basket remains a terrible online trader .
negative	low_prices are not everything you have to be confident you are going to get what you paid for within the timescales contracted for or at the very least be kept_informed , things_happen but not knowing is hard to deal with .
negative	i really do not think value basket will ever learn and predict their constant bad_reviews will eventually put them out of business .
negative	amazon , eglobal and many other online traders can deliver but value basket just cannot .
negative	bought a base for £_00 and was sent the wrong base emailed with no reply back
negative	i find their subscriptions renewal procedures dubious .
negative	e . g .
negative	you may cancel autorenewals on your account settings , however , they still deduct subscriptions as long as you don_'_t ' cancel ' your active subscriptions .
negative	this is unfair trading and targets vulnerable subscribers ...
negative	ordered a kookaburra rogue 000 ' heavy ', but received a ' medium ' after more than a week .
negative	delay was explained as the item being out of stock ( no info was offered during telephone_enquiry / online checkout ).
negative	when i tried to return the bat , was asked to send it via_royal_mail recorded delivery ( 00p was offered by millet to cover the recorded delivery label !
negative	), royal_mail refused recorded delivery ( due to the size of the parcel ), item was returned via_parcelforce ( and this cost 00 gbp ).
negative	millet refused to reimburse for the cost of delivery despite repeat requests and the website claiming that the cost of delivery is reimbursed if an error is made and the ' wrong item ' despatched .
negative	do not bother ordering on line with this company .
negative	my order did not turn_up so they sugested i order another and pay next_day delivery . i would have to wait to claim my money back . we can all afford that carnt we .
negative	literally the worst customer_care skills in the history of the world .
negative	do not use this company for anything , ever .
negative	totally abusive , cheeky , sarcastic and offensive .
negative	this company have obviously never_heard of customer_care and they dont deserve to be recognised as a supplement selling business .
negative	stay_away at all costs !
negative	ordered a rain_cover when purchasing hauck turbo pushchair , the one received was not as illustrated and is a very poor fit . my daughter gets wet when it rains !!

negative	please , please read through all the disasters people have had dealing_with what i would call " illlegal " company !!!
negative	absolute cowboys in all_aspects , thieves , robbers , no customer service at all !!!
negative	they have just quite_simply cancelled my flight even_though it '_s been booked and confirmed since 0nd december and paid in full .

negative	i ordered a nokia_lumia_000 on the 00 august .
negative	it was showing as in stock on their website .
negative	the money was taken that day , but it never arrived .
negative	over the following 0_weeks the item still showed as in stock and the price was lowered by £_00 .
negative	they refused to offer me the phone at the new price and after many emails and promises i cancelled my order on the 00th_sept .
negative	another 0_weeks have passed with lots of emails and promises , but still no refund .

negative	i was delighted to find an online seller with a clear website where i could confidently purchase a spare_part for my triton aquasense shower .
negative	however , after making my purchase i did not receive any communication from this site .
negative	when i contacted national_shower_spares again they told me that they had sent me 0 emails previously but i had received neither ( in my inbox or spam folders ).
negative	at this point they had taken payment for the part but would not ship because they now wanted an additional payment for shipping .
negative	i provided authorisation to charge the shipping cost but feel that they were very unprofessional in charging the spare_part and giving the impression that this was the only cosy , only to refuse to ship the part unless an additional payment was made .
negative	if this is not an underhanded marketing_ploy to increase revenue then they need to upgrade their e_- commerce system to fully display ( and charge ) all costs to the customer before charging .
negative	other than this major_issue ( and the non - communication ) i had no issues , the part was as_described and my shower is working again .
negative	i purchased a hotbox shilton 0 . 0kw electric greenhouse_heater from greenhouse_warehouse and put it in our greenhouse on a low setting .
negative	when the weather got colder we started to get regular power outages in the house where the main rcd in our fusebox was tripping out .
negative	after investigation i found that it was the heater causing this .
negative	what was happening was that a fine , metallic dust was coming off of the element when in use .
negative	this dust , being metallic , was getting on the power contacts in the unit and causing an earth loop tripping the rcd .
negative	the amount of powder was a lot .
negative	my electrician told me that is unit was dangerous as the dust , being conducting could be lethal if it got wet ( it was laying all over the floor ) and was stepped on .
negative	given than the user of this greenhouse is my 00 year_old mother - in - law , who would never have seen the powder , the potential of this to be dangerous is huge !
negative	i contacted greenhouse_warehouse as soon as we realised what the problem was , but its been a month and still no reply .
negative	i '_m very unhappy with both the product itself ( it being potentially lethal ) and the post sales support from greenhouse_warehouse .
negative	if they read this i would be very happy to ( finally ) hear from them .
negative	avoid this company if you ever expect to get any kind of after sales support !
negative	i ordered and had delivered a very expensive garden set of furniture .
negative	unfortunately , two of the threaded bars that fix the legs to the table were of the wrong_size - i reported this to them and was told by email that i would get a call on the 00th to arrange replacement parts .
negative	after chasing by email ( multiples times ) and attempting to chase by phone ( you go into a 00 min wait in a paid for 0000 number to still get no reply ) and via their own contact form on the website , i still , as of this time ( 00 : 00 on the 00th ) have had no call or email from them to sort_out this problem .
negative	made worse by the fact that the only reason we ordered from them was the quick delivery as we had guests for last weekend , who ended_up sitting on the chairs ( which were pre_- built ) looking at an un - assembled table with their lunches on their laps - thanks for a ruined weekend worldstores !
negative	so i '_ve had to wait for days with still no resolution and with a decent weekend coming up will have to spend it looking at the uneless pile of aluminium and wood on my patio .
negative	worldstores make even bt '_s customer_support look professional and that '_s saying something !
negative	i placed an order on 0rd february .
negative	arrived 00 days_later .
negative	the item was faulty .
negative	have emailed them and recieved no response .
negative	they knew the item was faulty before they sent it , they just sent it anyway .
negative	£_00 down .
negative	save your money and find a decent company to buy from .
negative	be warned - if something isn_'_t right the company won_'_t entertain you and you will lose your money !
negative	!
negative	can say nothing good about them .
negative	don_'_t ever buy from this website , order place on the 0th_december , still not here by christmas .... pointless service , therefore pointless company
negative	i took the trouble to travel to your outlet to purchase white outdoor_lights , to be informed that you only had none of the two pin type left in stock .
negative	one of your staff did take the trouble to search the stock shelves , he informed me that he had found the last set in stock .
negative	i duly purchased only to discover that the lights were in fact ...... yellow !!
negative	!
negative	very disappointed .
negative	a wrong_size of the item was sent to me .
negative	the invoice had a clear note for the size i chose for .
negative	when i returned the item , there was no full_refund even it was not my mistake .
negative	this is not how to run a business .
negative	very slow to respond .
negative	wont recommend
negative	we received an email in the morning saying our item was out for delivery that day , and on checking the tracking it was showing it as on the van out for delivery .
negative	so , i waited in expecting to see the item sometime that day .
negative	after wasting a whole day waiting for this delivery i checked the tracking again and there was a note saying it had been returned to the service centre at 0 . 00 despite supposedly being_able to deliver up to 0pm .
negative	imagine our dismay the next_day when we again checked the tracking and an additional line had been put in before the line about its return to the service centre saying " could not gain_access at 0 . 00am ".
negative	what an utter lie - our place is so easily_accessible its not true .
negative	shocking duisgusting behaviour to just lie about a non attempted delivery .
negative	we have had yodel deliver to us on many occassions without a problem so why was this so difficult ???
negative	.... and to then lie is outrageous and totally_unacceptable !!!!
negative	we are so angry about this we will take it up with customer_services and complaints_dept tomorrow !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
negative	!
negative	i can not believe_how bad the customer service has_been with tap portugal .
negative	they lost my luggage on a flight from the uk to brazil , and nobody tried to help , answered the phone or replied to my emails .
negative	eventually my case arrived 0 days_later as i was heading home , and still 0_weeks on nobody from tap in brazil , the uk or in portugal will reply to my emails .
negative	as for the flight - the plane was fairly old with a ' entertainment ' that was awful for a 00 hour flight , and uncomfortable seats .
negative	this will be my one and only experience of flying with tap .
negative	i ordered this globe 0 - 0_weeks before fathers_day , as it looked like a really good present that my dad would like .
negative	all seemed to be going well , however the passed and the globe didn_'_t arrive .
negative	i decided to email globee to find out what was happening with my order .
negative	after 0_weeks they still didn_'_t even bother to reply .
negative	i have now emailed them to cancel the order , as i '_m not confident whether this is even a genuine retailer .
negative	really really disappointed with the service .
negative	don_'_t waste your time with globee !
negative	i purchased a samsung 00 " led_tv from pixmania as the price was very good .
negative	the tv arrived 0 days_later , which was good , however i noticed that the tv had been shipped from france , which seemed odd .
negative	i then went to set the tv up - there was no uk mains_lead , just a 0 pin continental_plug - i decided to persevere and set the tv by using a mains_plug i had , only to discover that the tv tuner was made for austria , germany and switzerland .
negative	there is no uk tuner facility which means no freeview hd .
negative	i '_m sending this tv back , and will not be dealing_with pixmania again , as the goods are not as_described .
negative	very misleading and very poor service .
negative	the flowers did not arrive in time .
negative	they were fresh and a nice bunch when they arrived however the time delay is not acceptable .
negative	i went on their website and bought a pair of dj cd players - or so i thought .
negative	technical problems their end prevented both of my credit / debit_cards working , it would not connect to the 0 d secure screen and they would not accept my payment , nor would they accept payment over the phone .
negative	the items were in my basket whilst i was going back and forth with the store and my card issuers to try and identify the problem ... which of course was their website , but they at first denied this .
negative	then the cd players disappeared out of my basket , and into another persons !
negative	at that point , after_contacting their levenshulme store again for the umpteenth time and complained as i had been the first person to try and buy these , " riz " confirmed that their technical_team had identified a fault connecting with the 0 d secure payment stage and that this other person couldn_'_t pay for these either .
negative	i then said that i was very worried that i had been trying to pay for this item for over an_hour and making numerous phone_calls , helping identify a problem on their website , only for it to then be fixed and someone_else then being_able to buy them from under my feet .
negative	there was talk of taking the item off sale or refunding the new buyer if the payment went through .
negative	and of course , due to me telling cash_converters of the problem , they got it fixed and this other person was able to pay in the end and they left me high and dry without a care in the world , after spending 0 hours and £_00 on phone_calls to try buy the items myself as i had got there first .
negative	i will never see a deal like that again and they couldn_'_t care less despite me being there first and helping them fix their website , which in turn helped someone_else get these over me .
negative	thanks a bunch
negative	update 00 - 00 - 00 -
negative	my issue was never resolved .
negative	i was sent a different piece of equipment that i reluctantly_agreed to , at a slightly reduced price - which turned_out to be faulty !!!!
negative	i had to wait_until 0pm one day to have this collected for a refund .
negative	i then saw the same models of the items , that cash_converters made sure i missed out on due to their mess up , on their website again .
negative	i suggested to resolve the issue , i should have those at the same price that i should have been able to buy the original items i wanted , that their website prevented me from doing in the first place , as they were basically the same .
negative	this should have been fair_enough , even if it did cost them a bit of money , they created this issue after all - that is if they gave a toss about customer service of course .
negative	they refused .
negative	they basically on the phone said they had " tried and failed to appease me and resolve the issue ".
negative	the most dire customer service i have ever received in my life .
negative	my follow_up email to their head_office was totally_ignored too .
negative	i am still struggling to believe a huge company , sponsoring a premier_league football_team , can treat people like this when they have cocked_up all along .
negative	a score of 0 on this site , scraping acceptable , is pretty bad and it shows that their priority is money money money - not customer service .
negative	so my message is , god help you if a purchase goes_wrong !!!
negative	oh and they still_haven_'_t explained why they originally couldn_'_t simply take the items off their website until the payment part of their site was fixed .
negative	really unhappy with this whole_experience which was completely preventable by cash_converters and has marred previously pretty good experiences of using them .
negative	a shame .
negative	bought a cd_player on their website , but the cd_player sent was different to the one described on their website , it was a lesser model .
negative	i emailed the store to complain and say i would keep the cd_player , as it seemed to work , if i could have a small refund back due to their listing error and sending me a cheaper model .
negative	i had nothing back from them .
negative	i eventually had to go through paypal just to get the small discount i requested .
negative	then a couple of weeks_later the cd_player , that was sent incorrectly , failed on me and no_longer powered on .
negative	i emailed the store again - asking what the warranty is on these items , again completely_ignored .
negative	i also emailed their head_office - completely_ignored .
negative	so i have not only been basically sent the wrong item , it has failed on me within 0 or 0_weeks of barely any use .
negative	i have sent numerous_emails to the store and their head_office and i have had not even 0 word back from them ..... shocking .
negative	i would ring the store but i am that wound up about it i am worried_about losing my temper over the phone .
negative	buying something over the internet really should not be this much hassle and now i have thrown_away my money .
negative	thanks very much .
negative	bought a used car from stratstone saab birmingham just before_christmas , were fine until i paid then just seem not to be_bothered and just wanted to usher me out of showroom as soon as possible , i was told when purchasing from them that missing owners_manual and details of warranty would follow in the post , the dealer closed not long after this but stratstones were very quick in sending a letter telling_me which other of their dealers i could visit to get my car serviced , repaired etc , but i never recieved the promised items in the post , so i emailed them , after a couple of days i got a reply saying they would look in to it and asking for further information and stating that their finance manager was at stratstone saab that day so would chase it up .
negative	since then despite several emails to the person_who responded to me and via their website i have heard_nothing from them at all .
negative	a bit_strange since one of the items i was missing was details of an extended_warranty that i was looking to take out with them .
negative	i know the car i purchased wasn_'_t a £_00k range_rover or jaguar ( it was only £ 0000 ) but surely every customer should be treated fairly .
negative	i will think_twice about setting_foot in a stratstone or evans_halshaw dealership again .
negative	btw the car i purchased has also developed a fault since purchase it looks_like the dual mass flywheel is failing and according to people who i have spoken to this would have been noticeable at a service ( which was supposedly done just before i picked_up the vehicle )
negative	i have so little faith in stratstones that i would rather pay to get this fixed myself than bother trying to claim on the 0 month_warranty given as i was told this was very basic and didn_'_t cover much and the limit on it was £_000 being as the repair will be more than double this i ' d rather go_elsewhere with my custom .
negative	jeg_bestilte_en_pakke med hjælp fra shopusa og_det_hele gik fint , indtil de sendte pakken fra deres terminal .. pakken er nu væk på 0 uge og_efter 0 - 0 mails hører jeg_ikke fra dem , og_kan_ikke få fat på dem på hverken mail eller telefon .
negative	kan absolut ikke anbefale shopusa til nogen , for der_er ingen hjælp hvis din pakke bliver væk , så lader de som ingenting .
negative	checked online and says delivered to number 0 .
negative	visited number 0 no sign there .
negative	no card left at mine .
negative	emailed uk mail who helpfully replied it was left at number 0 .
negative	in the mean time someone from 0 roads away brought the parcel to me !!
negative	delivered to completly the wrong_address .

negative	i ordered a grade a rated phone by standard delivery which was meant to take 0 - 0 days , as i hadn_'_t received my order after waiting a fortnight i contacted them and was assured the phone was going to be dispatched that afternoon by first_class .
negative	still no phone after waiting a further 0 days so contacted again to ask when i would get the phone .
negative	i was told because they had been busy there was a delay and they stated they will send the phone by guaranteed delivery and received this on the following_day .
negative	the phone a received was not in grade a condition , the speaker grill had been glued on wonky and the screen was unresponsive at the top of screen making it very hard to reply to text_messages received .
negative	i contacted refurb phones to arrange to return phone and get a refund .
negative	i was expected to pay the return postage which i did and after complaining received half of the postage back , i i also received a full_refund after having to ask 0 times for it .
negative	i gave this company0 star only because they refunded my month within a month of placing order .
negative	will never use this company again and would recommend anyone_thinking of buying from them not to .
negative	00 days for delivery of products .
negative	shocking .
negative	will never use again .
negative	order process was fine - that '_s the only good point .
negative	if you stated on your website that you used yodel i would never have ordered from you .
negative	received an email from yodel stating it would be delivered on saturday .
negative	waited the 0 hours at work waiting for the delivery ; nothing turned_up .
negative	spoke to yodel today ( monday ) they don_'_t know where the parcel is so i let you guys know .
negative	spoke a one of your ladies and told her about the email i received and she says you don_'_t request saturday deliveries ; that '_s great but the email states something very different !
negative	so still don_'_t have any goods and can '_t really be_bothered to chase the idiots at yodel so hopefully i '_ll be getting money back and use a reputable_company with decent couriers .
negative	the delivery is part of the overall service that '_s why i would never recommend your company ; you chose the couriers so it was your choice .
negative	consistently rubbish at everything they do .
negative	this company should be forced to close .
negative	firstly - it is disgraceful that you can only write comments if you are satisfied .
negative	so repairs0 block out comments if they do not like them ?
negative	?
negative	they kept my phone for 0_weeks when they promise to repair in one day .
negative	it then took them another 0_weeks to refund my money .
negative	i sent my iphone_0s in for a screen repair which they received on the 0th_november .
negative	they told me a week_later they were awaiting a part and the phone would be with me by the end of the week .
negative	this came and went , and i called to chase .
negative	still no parts , but they are coming in this week .
negative	again nothing .
negative	i was then told that they had no idea when they would get parts in and i had to wait indefinitely .
negative	they finally sent the phone back to me on 00th_november , it took them until the 0th_december to refund my money .
negative	they constantly promised that a manager would call me back but never did , and they ignored all of my emails .
negative	i would never consider_using or recommending this company .
negative	they never once were understanding or apologetic and simply kept telling_me it was not their fault .
negative	they will also promise to refund , and then will not investigate for 00 working_days if anything_goes wring .
negative	utter , utter ineptitude , they do not deserve to be in business .
negative	i look_forward to seeing them on watchdog .
negative	ordered a couple of items before_christmas .
negative	received complete rubbish .
negative	this catalogue should carry a warning .
negative	have made a return but going by the terms and conditions they stipulate dont hold out much hope .
negative	( i refuse to make a phonecall to facilitate the return of faulty items , is this even legal ? )
negative	i will however do my utmost to ensure that all my business and mail contacts do not get caught out by these_people and will approach local_newsagents to remove their future catalogues from papers if my refund doesnt appear .
negative	it only took 0_weeks to receive a sit up bench i ordered from them via amazon and then i discovered that 0 or 0 items were missing from the box , not mentioning the tools to assemble the beast .
negative	i assume , if i wanted to return the item , i would need to fork_out at_least £_000 to send it back to china .
negative	most of the reviews on complaintsboard . com are indeed legit .
negative	however , a lot of scammers increasingly use the site to extract money from businesess .
negative	they post fake and defamatory reviews about your company and once the bad review appears in google they contact you to offer their services ( often pretending to be a seo company ) to remove the fake review .
negative	unfortunately , due to us regulations , you can '_t have the fake review removed by the site owner and they don_'_t seem to care about it anyway .
negative	this is an illegal practice affecting many businesses including mine recently .
negative	mp0_player as gift - so cheap and its worthless - better not give gifts !
negative	utterly disappointed ... my kid was like - what the **** is this ?
negative	its useless !
negative	no reputable agents participating so do not waste your time !
negative	it should be made clear that you do not do a weekend delivery like most businesses these days .
negative	i expected 00 or 00 hour delivery and was let_down when this didn_'_t happen .
negative	went to the new malden pc_world superstore ( ahem , ' super '?
negative	really ?)
negative	on a saturday ( 0 / 00 / 00 ).
negative	i was looking to buy three different things : 0 pair of samsung_0d_glasses , 0x_0gb_ddr0_ram , and an hp_pavilion laptop .
negative	none of these items were in stock !!!
negative	it '_s time to start looking at alternative shops .
negative	i mean all three items , three totally different items not in store ... why ?
negative	still_waiting for goods after 0_weeks
negative	very poor customer has_been given by fitting_centre .
negative	staff were very rude and did not balance my wheels either .
negative	i would never recommend or go back .
negative	voucher was not reconised ................. much communication to sort_out
negative	basically the courier decided to leave my box on my " porch " i live next to a busy pathway and when i got home item was not there .
negative	this is not myproteins fault !
negative	but
negative	i have emailed them twice , in regards to my missing item and have had no response , hermes who delivered my item responded within 00_hours advising me to contact myprotein , as they will not deal with me directly .
negative	hopefully me posting this will get me a response , as its a joke .
negative	i have been using myprotein for easily around 0 years , and have never had a problem , their customer service is normally excellent .
negative	so not quite sure why it is the opposite now !
negative	i bought a tablet in store with a charger that didn_'_t fit , i bought a blackberry online for a great price then days_later i received an email_telling_me it has_been sold in store so i phoned the store they were not willing to give me the same phone for same price , i went online again and bought another blackberry for an average price when it arrived it is in horrific condition with snapped casing and ah tv charger i think this is wrong i will never shop at cash_generator again and make_sure my family and friens don_'_t .
negative	it '_s a real_shame so many companies choose to use yodel .
negative	i '_ve had the misfortune of dealing_with them after buying goods from both ' very ' and ' carphone_warehouse '.
negative	they really don_'_t do good service , or to think of it , anything at all .
negative	it '_s good to see that they are making lots of money and i think this is evident from the massive and no doubt costly company rebrand exercise .
negative	it has to be said , the brand itself is pretty_cool , but what good is a catchy brand_name when the service ' delivered ' or in this case not , is nothing but appalling .
negative	every_single time i have had a yodel delivery there has_been a multitude of problems .
negative	delivery men saying that they knocked when they didn_'_t , leaving expensive goods literally on the door_step , despite the fact the path across the front of our house is used by everyone living on the street , and even deliveries not showing up at all .
negative	their customer_services team are rude and unhelpful and i genuinely think that the delivery staff must play_football and other sports activities with the parcels .
negative	last time i checked the corners of an iphone box were pointed , that well know corner shape , but after yodel took my brand_new £_000 iphone 0 on board , they seemed intent on reshaping the box into , let '_s say a more rounded design .
negative	an_absolute_joke of a business , avoid if you can .
negative	the only positive thing is that i '_m clearly not the only one who has felt the need to vent some truly disgraceful issues .
negative	ok yodel , so on your website you say :
negative	we look different and feel different because at yodel we truly believe there '_s a better way of delivering .
negative	a way that gives clients and customers at home or in businesses the service they want and need .
negative	and at yodel , we have the scale and capacity to make it happen .
negative	and we do so with a smile !
negative	you certainly do believe that there '_s a better way of delivering don_'_t you .
negative	i ' d probably stick with the old concept of getting a parcel from a to b , in one piece and on time .
negative	we want and need our parcels on time .
negative	we don_'_t need late or missed deliveries , damaged goods , rude and unhelpful staff etc .
negative	you don_'_t make it happen and i '_ve never seen a smile .
negative	you might be laughing to yourselves when you see the company profits .
negative	most of us have to laugh , else we ' d probably cry .
negative	... maybe revise your ' about us section '?
negative	oh and this did make me laugh ( also from your website )
negative	' at yodel we really give you something to shout about .'
negative	- yes yodel , yes you do .
negative	so my advice to yodel , stop spraying your vans green and start reinvesting your profits into a good team of people .
negative	i might also suggest a quick google of what a delivery company is supposed to do , it seems you ' re struggling with this concept a little .
negative	thanks yodel , i hope that i never have to deal with you ever again .
negative	parcel collected from settle north_yorkshire ...... no_problems ... excellent courier .
negative	the inter_parcel labels were stuck and pasted over our original address .
negative	when the parcel arrived in france the courier
negative	could not deliver the parcel as the printed_label was incorrect ....
negative	he did not have the common_sense to peel_off the inter_parcel label and double_check with the address beneath it ...
negative	we were not contacted to confirm the address in france ..
negative	the parcel was sent back to crawley ... we were informed that we had to pay £_00
negative	for the return of our parcel or it would be destroyed .
negative	we had to pay the fine to retrieve our parcel ... which then had to be resent out to france .
negative	we are a tiny business and had sold this hand made dress to a customer in france for £_00 .
negative	please do the maths !
negative	huge loss to a little british struggling manufacturer .
negative	senders be aware ... be very aware ..... use a different postage option .... as the couriers have no gumption to think out of the bubble .......
negative	had called instore to view item wanting to buy diving_gear from wet_suit goggle to o0 tank and bc etc .
negative	was there for 00_minutes and not one person enquired if they could help me .
negative	left empty_handed .
negative	now looking at other site to complete purchase .
negative	all seven shop assistance walking around could do with some customer service training .
negative	ok so i browsed a few different websites and came_across a lovely_bunch of flowers on serenata , ordered was happy to pay nearly 00 pounds .
negative	wrote a little message for my mum .
negative	ladies and gentlemen that was as good as it gets .
negative	0 .
negative	the flowers arrived in some amazon style fashion just left on my mothers door_step .
negative	0 .
negative	the flowers look nothing like what i ordered on the website .
negative	0 .
negative	i got buds , who in there right mind would give somebody buds as a gift ?
negative	0 .
negative	the buds are discoloured and already brown and worsening .
negative	0 .
negative	there was no card or message on the flowers .
negative	0 .
negative	they are small and pathetic
negative	i have been in touch via e_- mail sent photos yet your company says the flowers are ok . no they are not i ordered flowers not discoloured dying buds .
negative	i expect a full_refund and ill send the buds back and maybe one of you can give them to your mother .
negative	the worst service ever , avoid like the plague .
negative	the worst customer service in the world , clueless staff whose only aim is to make money out of the passenger .
negative	i ' d rather wlak than fly with these_crooks again
negative	used ocado for all online deliveries and get almost 000_% what i order and courteous drivers and delivery times always on target with lots of discounts and food that lasts more than a few_days - now compared to tescos in one of my orders of about 00 items 0 were substitutes for yes youve guessed it - tesocs own_brand - i mean 0 of the items were kellogs corn flakes and heinz beans - unbelievable !
negative	and as for the drivers ........ they really should work for the refuse companys - reluctant even to bring it to the door - and if you have a problem you get a call from some lout who_wants to listen to himself rather_than you - never again - twice was enough for me - and their stores aren_'_t much_better either
negative	i have used the site a couple of times with no issues , but when there is an issue this is where is falls down !
negative	no contact with the mods or site owner since saturday - phone has_been missing for over a week !
negative	does look like they even have insurance for anything like scams ridiculous !
negative	even ebay realizes there are scammers about !
negative	i am out £_000 with no way of replacing the item !
negative	i made a cash withdrawal for £ 0000 a week_ago and still_haven_'_t been paid it .
negative	they say the withdrawal has_been processed and i need to chase it up with my bank .
negative	i '_ve done this and they can '_t see any credits pending which i '_ve told betfair and they say it '_s not their problem as they '_ve processed the withdrawal .
negative	great , how the hell am i supposed to get my £ 0000 ???
negative	?
negative	on the 00th_june i bought a golf belt which should have been delivered within 0 - 0 days and now 00 days and still no sign of it .
negative	i have contacted dpd who say they have never received anything and all clubhouse golf do is direct you to their pathetic tracking_system .
negative	i '_ve now escalated this problem to paypal trying to get my money back but still clubhouse golf are failing to respond .
negative	absolutely_shocking service and i warn anyone away from using this website !
negative	this company is absolutely_terrible !
negative	i purchased a gigantic piano keyboard for £_00 . 00 for my 0 year_old_son to open on christmas day and when we did it was not only damaged but it was broke .
negative	i immediately emailed them and was told i would be contacted in 0 working_days .
negative	that was nearly 0_weeks_ago now and i have sent another 0 emails to which i still_haven_'_t heard_anything .
negative	i have also tried_contacting them 0 times on facebook and twice they have deleted my wall posts and have not responded to my status including them .
negative	i am now going to take some type legal_action_against them to stop them getting away with this with other people .
negative	i ordered a sloth mask and when looking at the pciture on the website it looks fantastic and well_worth the £_00 including_postage but on receipt of my mask it was not the same but a cheap immation of the one advertised . not worth more than £ 0 .
negative	no one can take_responsibility and now i have to pay to send it back .... i will never use this company again and warn_others before purchasing they you may not get what you see advertised .
negative	used to love domino '_s until my young son got short changed at the till - put that aside , they then took off the menu my favourite pizza hot & spicy .... then i compared their prices to pizza_hut - have to say i '_m not a pizza_hut customer .
negative	on a day when interflora couldn_'_t offer next - day delivery , i found iflorist could .
negative	but in the event , next - day took 0 days .
negative	whcih was a bit_disappointing for my relative '_s 00th_birthday .
negative	won_'_t be using them again
negative	i had been waiting for my package more than a week before it arrived .
negative	some of the items on your website you don_'_t have in stock , i had to order a ps0_controller three_times before i was successful .
negative	this took up three_days of my time as i got an email the day after ordering telling_me i will have to order another item .
negative	when my order arrived it was dirty full of scratches and was very worn .
negative	definitely not worth the money i spent , i probably could have got a better quality item for a better price some where else .
negative	i definitely will not be purchasing anything of cash_generator again .
negative	is it just me or are a lot of the reviews for this company very flattering and very similar !?
negative	;-)
negative	i have had 0 cars valued by wbacar .
negative	com and the reason they can ' buy any car ' is that they offered me about a third of their market value ( a third of what i then sold them for privately ).
negative	after giving a basic valuation they then take £_00 off that as an administrator fee as a starting_point .
negative	if you want the money quickly they charge for that too .
negative	they also state that their very low valuation is for the car in perfect_condition and any variation from this will reduce the valuation .
negative	this seemed to me to be a desperate final measure to sell my car for a fraction of what it was worth , so i didn_'_t !
negative	just beware ....
negative	virgin_media , the company that suddenly offeres cheap deals to people when i used to pay thru the roof for half bit 0mb bb service with no sky_tv_channels .
negative	the ic and tv connection kept disconnecting every 00_minutes and caused no end of headaches , plus the callcentres in india do not help .
negative	they never fixed the probelm after 0 weks and 0 engineers and i will never use them again .
negative	i was on telewest for 00 years and had excellent service but overpriced !
negative	then virgin step in and we lose sky_tv and we get v + box with 0 hd channel - bbc hd !
negative	i vcannit stress enough how bad an experience they provided , thank_god for sky .
negative	they have been no problem .
negative	received flowers friday .
negative	dead by sunday
negative	sent away to stockport for a philips mp0_player .
negative	it stated had everything with box .
negative	it arrived with no charger .
negative	phoned the guy ollie up , said he would look and either phone or email me at the end of the day to let_me know if he had one , did , nt even bother !
negative	i had to ring them back .
negative	now i have been told it will be collected because they have no charger , on monday .
negative	even that when they told me did not sound convincing , although i have got a tracking_number .
negative	saying that i have bought from other stores and had no_hassel .
negative	shoud tell you if part of the item is missing .
negative	the fact they could not find it proves it !
negative	product was poorly_packaged andleaked badly in the po van and we have received a credit for it .
negative	the top can twist in the soft packaging .
negative	bought a pair of combat cargo trousers which cost 00 quid and they were very badly made .
negative	i returned them for a refund which i '_m still_waiting for as they claim they never recieved them even_though i have proof if postage .
negative	the annoying_thing is that i ordered more stuff from them straight after before this became an issue and gave them more business which i wish i hadn_'_t .
negative	still i will never use them again .
negative	ordered a pair of shoes which i would of thought would of been new .
negative	to my disappointment the one shoe was new - the other shoe looks_like it was over 00 months old and been in their shop .
negative	be careful - although the items may be in the sale they may not be 0000 saleable .
negative	disappointed !
negative	bought pink tickets at the o0_arena , london for the 00 / 00 /_0000 for my wife last christmas .
negative	spent £_000 .
negative	tickets were unsuccessfully delivered on 00 / 00 / 00 by royal_mail ( 0 days before the show ) to the wrong_address after i did an address change on their website 0_weeks previous after lots of worry_about not being home .
negative	went to collect tickets next_day from royal_mail who stated i had to wait 00_hours before collection .
negative	( friday 00 / 00 / 00 ) [ day before gig ]
negative	after 0 calls to viagogo , and promised call_backs from a senior_manager ( which did not happen ) i was told just to " sort it out " as there was no other way to get into gig even_though ticketmaster offer a re - print on their website .
negative	viagogo had no further details of the ticket to pass to me ( seat number , row , ticket number etc_...)
negative	had to cancel train_tickets and hotel stay in london of the friday as travelling from newcastle so i could pick_up tickets the next_day .
negative	picked_up tickets saturday_morning from royal_mail to discover the seats advertised as " side view " are actually " rear side view " mis_- sold as far as i am concerned .
negative	all at a cost of £_000 for 0 tickets + £_00 cancelled ( non_refundable ) hotel + £_000 train_ticket journey .
negative	follow me on twitter_@ danryanskinner to share your experiences of @ viagogo so we can protect others in the future of this awful service .
negative	here '_s a big warning not to use rentalcars . com .
negative	we pre_- paid £_00 . 00 for 0 days rental .
negative	we took all the documentation that rentalcars . com told us to , including driver '_s licence and credit_card .
negative	when we turned_up , the company would not rent us the car because we didn_'_t have a second part of of our driver '_s licence .
negative	rentalcars . com never mentioned this .
negative	we had to get a taxi because we couldn_'_t get a rental car .
negative	not only did rentalcars . com not apologise for not bringing to our attention all the documentation that we would need , but they refused to give us our money back .
negative	the rental_agreement was never fulfilled .
negative	it cost rentalcars . com nothing except the processing of our payment and yet they still keep our money .
negative	they have a specific paragraph in their terms stating " where the vehicle cannot be picked_up due to insufficient documentation ... this will be treated as a cancellation ... a 000_% cancellation_fee will be charged where we are not notified of cancellation prior to the start of the rental ."
negative	they must have had numerous customers not know that there are two parts to a uk licence that they need to take to the rental company and yet they do not bring this to the attention of their customers .
negative	why would they have that paragraph about a 000_% cancellation_fee in there terms of agreement ?
negative	easy money for them ?
negative	do you know of any other company that charges a 000_% cancellation_fee ?
negative	bought a beko_tumble_dryer on the 00th_feb which never came into stock .
negative	i cancelled the order on the 0th_march as it had not been fullfilled and i had not even had the courtesy of any communication .
negative	i was advised that a refund would be made within 00 days ( 00 days !!!!
negative	its not my fault that this company did not receive stock on the date advertised on their site ).
negative	guess_what , 00 days comes and goes and no refund .
negative	despite 0 phone_calls and an email , i have still not received a refund 0 0 / 0 months later .
negative	on every contact i receive an excuse ( but no appology ) and a promise to process the refund that same day , but it never happens .
negative	after 00 years of shopping online this is the first time i have had to invoke section 00 with my credit_card company .
negative	ultimate applicances appear to get good reviews when everything goes to plan but buyer bewhere if the unforeseen happens .
negative	my advice , pay a couple of quid more and don_'_t take the chance .
negative	deal with this company at your_peril .
negative	firstly , my original delivery was scheduled for an afternoon slot , and when i asked if there was any chance it could be changed to a morning slot , customer_services said no .
negative	my order then turned_up , without a warning phonecall , at 00am .
negative	the shed turned_up on a flat - bed van , with one driver .
negative	the shed is 00 feet by 00 feet , and some panels like the gable with the double doors are extremely heavy .
negative	when i asked the delivery man , whom i was having to help_unload the shed and carry it into the garden myself , how he was supposed to move the heavy bits on his own , he said " i have to slide them ".
negative	when i asked if this didn_'_t damage them , he said " often , yes ".
negative	how is that a ) safe , or b ) good service ?
negative	when we have unloaded all of the panels , i found that two were delivered damaged .
negative	this wasn_'_t done during the unloading , it had happened in the yard before the shed was picked_up .
negative	so i rang waltons to ask for replacements , and was told they would be " attempt " to deliver them " within about 00 - 00 working_days ".
negative	how on earth is that good service ?
negative	eventually i was rung with a delivery date for the replacement parts .
negative	i thus took a day off of work , and sat in my livingroom waiting for the delivery .
negative	by 0pm i was bored of waiting , so i rang waltons to ask when the delivery would be , to which i was told " oh , someone should have rung you this morning , to tell you that your replacement panels were damaged in the yard and need to be re - made ".
negative	this was now starting to take the michael !
negative	after a lot of phonecalls , i finally spoke to a lady_who sounded_like she cared , who ensured i got new replacement panels two_days_later .
negative	so it has taken me 0_weeks to get a whole shed , some of it is still damaged but i repaired it myself rather_than attempt to get anything_else delivered , i had to unload it myself , the original man on customers services was lethargic and uncaring at best - rude at times , and the final product is of a poor quality .
negative	also , the " free treatment " states on the front it is for decorative purposes .
negative	it doesn_'_t even protect the shed .
negative	avoid waltons at all costs .
negative	told buy this rubbish company to basically go away .
negative	dont wish any bad on some people but go_bust your rubbish ...!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
negative	!
negative	purchased ajax tickets and was gutted to find out after spending money on flights and hotel to find the tickets were fake and lost a lot of money ..!!!
negative	thanks for nothing ..... dont trust this lot .....£ 0000 up in smoke , can '_t began to tell you how bad i feel , just put it down to experience .
negative	i have ordered a mattress with a quite cheap price , availability was not instant but waiting time was not bad ( 0 days ).
negative	the surprise came when after a lot of calls and 0 week without_any signs of the mattress they told me they lost the mattress and they have none in stock !
negative	the alternatives which would take a couple of days afterwards were in lower quality and they couldn_'_t offer any better mattress .
negative	i '_m still puzzling how they could loose a double mattress , measuring 0 by 0 , 00m !!!
negative	at the end you receive what you pay for , so i went to another company and had a next_day delivery , search online and avoid this dodgy company !
negative	one of our bookings were cancelled and what hostelbookers limited to do is to charge the 00 %.
negative	they asked us to contact the hotelier and deal with him .
negative	no responsibility at all .
negative	later they offered a refund if we book again , which they apparently forgot .
negative	not sure if the booking went through as the hotel is not responding emails .
negative	very stressful and messy booking .
negative	first and last reservation with them .
negative	after accidentally recieving a car_park ticket at an asda carpark i found their customer service was terrible .
negative	i '_m £_00 out of pocket and they don_'_t care about thier customers .
negative	store manager mike doidge - rude and not helpful .
negative	customer service advisor mary - ann lied to me and couldn_'_t help
negative	customer service manager william hayton - didn_'_t even phone back
negative	0 days_later after i sent an email_stating i wasn_'_t going to be a customer anymore i recieved a call off someone called rob who wouldn_'_t even tell me his full name and he was as useful as a choclolate tea pot .
negative	don_'_t shop at asda !!
negative	!
negative	we had an email to say the goods were on there way and would arrive next_day or day after .
negative	a week_later nothing had arrived .
negative	i could not track the order so i had to chase the goods which had somehow gone_astray .
negative	they did then arrive the next_day but by then i was disappointed with the service and won_'_t use this company again .
negative	i sent off a 0 - month old_iphone 0 that had been in a case the whole time .
negative	i was initially quoted £_000 .
negative	they wrote back claiming that the rear of the case was scratched and only gave_me £_000 !
negative	furthermore , if i wasn_'_t happy with their " random valuation " they would charge me £_00 to send the phone back .
negative	avoid this company unless you are prepared to sell your phone for a fraction of its value !
negative	i have had the misfortune of several parcels being delivered by this so - called parcel delivery company over the past few_months .
negative	on every occasion the parcel has taken over a week to arrive on what was supposed to be a 00 - hour service and they usually can '_t find my address ( even_though fed - ex , dhl , ukmail , ups etc .
negative	can !!)
negative	i have been trying for over 0_weeks to open a merchant account with them to accept credit_cards for my business !
negative	sagepay never answer their phones , there is a recorded_message_saying ' call back later ' then they hang up .
negative	sagepay never reply to emails .
negative	i am now with barclays and very happy with their service , i am_glad i realised how bad sagepay were before i started trading with them .
negative	they were polite but not really apologetic for having a stick listed as in stock on their website but not actually having one in .
negative	the excuse was the the stick had been on sale for 0 years and they have three stores to stock .
negative	victim of their own success ?
negative	or just wasting my time and money as i payed by paypal and so to get the money back to my account i will have to pay a charge .
negative	basically , not impressed !
negative	what a joke - since when does next_day delivery end up not arriving the next_day when you wait in all day for it ?
negative	why does the company have phone lines that either get cut_off or never answered ?
negative	this company is letting down the businesses that use them to deliver their product
negative	i order a front and rear_light set , they got that wrong .
negative	i ordered a front and rear mud guard and i only got a rear mud guard , even_though they showed a front and rear in the picture and in the describtion .
negative	they weren_'_t helpful .
negative	fast delivery
negative	i have been reluctant to write a poor review about this company , because i was sure they would resolve my problems .
negative	i believed the customer service centre , when they told me numerous_times , how sorry they were for not replying and that they have once again forwarded my request for refund , to the accounts_department .
negative	i had returned two_separate_packages of ink_cartridges for refund , because they refused to be accepted by my printers .
negative	no problem with that , these things_happen .
negative	i just wanted a refund , i could then decide if i would order some more from a different batch .
negative	i did not receive any acknowledgement of receipt , i had to email several_times to find out if they had been received .
negative	no problem , we have received them and a refund is on it '_s way .
negative	more emails sent , eventually i got a refund for one of the packages , i don_'_t know which one , they were both the same price .
negative	many more emails sent and assurances that the remaining refund would arrive soon .
negative	now despite getting the automated_reply , and then a read receipt for my emails , no one will reply .
negative	this has taken over a month and still not resolved .
negative	so i guess the answer is yes , i am gullible to believe that this company are professional and honest .
negative	les leech
negative	ltk0000000000000x
negative	order number : pl - pi0000000 [ 0000000 ]
negative	order number : pl - pi0000000 [ 0000000 ]
negative	my experience is similar to many others here , place order , money taken , thats the last i heard from them !
negative	the very few positive_reviews on this site indicate a company trying but failing to offer customer service , if you are lucky_enough to order something de cuisine have in stock then i am sure they will send it .
negative	however in most_cases your money will be taken and that is the last you will see of it .
negative	please , if you happen to hit the jackpot and are among the chosen few who do get what you ordered , do not recommend this company to friends , yours was an_isolated transaction your friends will lose money , if in any doubt or subscribe to the conspiracy theorists , contact devon trading_standards or your credit_card company they will know de cuisine , you have been_warned !
negative	great product and price but delivery to slow i have had goods from other_companies for free and arrived quicker would not use again and if you want your goods quick the this company is to slow on delivery
negative	when it was time to return to our vehicle , the stairs became very congested , the doors from the staircase b at 0g level would not open , vehicles could be heard starting up out on the car deck , some passengers became frightened , there was an attempt to return to the upper decks , this was met with a surge of people coming down , it was dangerous and frightening , there were no dfds staff to be seen and no announcements made , eventually the doors did open temporarily letting some passengers out onto the deck , they then locked up again , more passengers were arriving by lift there was nowhere for them to go , our party was split up , it was a frightening experience .
negative	completely_different_colour sent out as to the item ordered and cost £_00 to return in order to get refund .
negative	everything that '_s wrong with internet_shopping under one roof !
negative	ordered 00 june .
negative	dispatched wednesday 00 june .. unfortunally the item , order number0000000 has not yet been delivered .
negative	stan @ stanrolls . co . uk
negative	lol this company is nothing more than a joke .
negative	0 attempts now to deliver time sensitive items , i ordered frozen fish_food during the bank_holiday_weekend , knowing it would not be sent out until the tuesday .
negative	it was supposed to arrive wednesday , absolutely nothing and when checking the tracking page i seen it was still in the sortation facility .
negative	spoke with the company i bought the food from and they looked into it , and got back to me and offered to send out replacements as they have been assured if they send a parcel out it would get to the customer today ... wrong no parcel , instead i get an email_informing_me my parcel has_been delayed and i wont get it until monday 00th .
negative	well interlink after the weekend you will be known as interstink as i have been in touch with the company , they have issued a full_refund to me and they have told me they will be taking this further with your selves .
negative	interlink have failed to deliver twice , wont be getting a 0rd chance .
negative	well i made an order with a company for mums 00 birthday_present .
negative	was sent an email on the 0th telling_me my parcel has_been sent by city_link express which is 00_hours .
negative	and not to check the tracking_link until after 0pm .
negative	i checked after 0 and it informed me parcel has_been scanned and is on its way to the delivery depot .
negative	delivery date is thursday 0th .
negative	i checked in the early hours of the morning * 0th * and still showing parcel scanned and on its way to delivery depot delivery date 0th .
negative	i checked a few_times through out yesterday and no up date .
negative	after 00_hours still no update on progress .
negative	i was told else where that city_link only update tracking 0 times , once collected , item arrives morning of delivery and item has_been delivered .
negative	pretty pathetic service if you ask me .
negative	well it is now delivery day and nearly 00_hours and yep still no new tracking_details , still been scanned and on its way to delivery depot and delivery date 0th .
negative	dpd kept me up to date on progress and then sent me an email giving me a 0 hour delivery slot , 0 mins into that delivery slot the door_bell went and it was an other parcel i had ordered .
negative	i did not even know dpd did that as i have never had anything delivered by them .
negative	i am only complaining_about lack of information / lack of tracking_details .
negative	well at the moment that is all i am commenting about , delivery is still for today , but is it going to show up ??
negative	?
negative	i still have not recieved my star pack after a week and no reply to any of my emails
negative	my order 0000000 was cancelled in less_than 00_hours despite having purchase from there online store already twice before and numerous_times in store , apparently my card did not pass security for which they could have contacted me to confirm any details which i was happy to verify however they didn_'_t bother .
negative	rang customer service who said they can '_t help or reinstate offer .
negative	welldone perfume shop ( owned by superdrug ) as i won_'_t be using your site again may be it about time you pick_up phone and speak with your customer than relying too much on your systems !

negative	i used british_gas over 0 years and they always sent me estimate which i paid in trust that i was paying correct amount , never i was sent meter read request , eventually when i found out that i paid them thousands in over charges they refused any refund , didn_'_t even both explaining is to why estimates were sent instead of meter read requests .
negative	my advise keep safe distance from this company do not use them or you will regret like me .
negative	also make_sure you have your account no .
negative	and bill hand if you write negative_review they will report it to trustpilot , not the positive once though !
negative	i made mistake of buying vaccum form vax twice which i regret as they both broke_down within week , absolute_rubbish company and products that are not tested before been sold through the country .
negative	do not buy there products or you shall regret like me , complete time waste , bought mr , henry hoover and it works like magic have used them for years without_any_issues !
negative	i have made mistake trusting philips and buying them many_times , all of my items sit and breakdown even something as simple as clock , products are designed well however quality is absolutely awful and i will ever recommend anyone to buy philips as you will see it won_'_t be long before you will see issues with product !
negative	never buying again !
negative	i booked my tickets with this company february last_year and decided to cancel in less_than 00_hours , despite booking in 0 months advance i was charge £_00 for cancelling item , money was refunded after waiting good 0_weeks !
negative	they employ most unprofessional and untrained staff who lack basic customer service skills .
negative	this company does not have a proper number to call !
negative	i advise keep away !
negative	the reviews are clearly fake and genuine customer won_'_t rate company when the provide such a poor service .
negative	never using again
negative	i have been bombarded by non sense letters asking to pay bill of an address that i have never lived at neither i have even been to such place .
negative	i guess their customers has disappear and they found my details with same name so they decided to pass my details to debt_collection_agency .
negative	it is horrible that numerous_calls has not stopped them from writing to me for paying service i never used !
negative	i will take this matter with relevant_department so this company can pay me for causing me massive inconvenience !
negative	scammers !
negative	i still_haven ’_t received the second item of my order despite_being told by iwantpants . com that it would be dispatched after a week ( see response below on 00 . 00 . 00 ).
negative	nobody has updated me with the situation of my order .
negative	the money was taken at the time of order yet even after 0_weeks + there is no sign of it .
negative	i have called emailed and filled in a contact form on the website and still nothing has happened .
negative	avis were not interested that i had organised insurance with rentalcars and explained that they would need a 0000 euro_deposit against damages .
negative	they said i could claim on rentalcars insurance in the event of damage / claim .
negative	in the event i ended_up paying an additional 00_euros a day for avis ' all inclusive ' insurance so recommend you do not purchase insurance from rentalcars .
negative	it was not made clear when i made the booking how the insurance works and that is shoddy in my opinion .

negative	purchased 0 henry vacuum_cleaners through groupon totalling_£_000 .
negative	delivery from the company ebeez was delayed so i contacted them , i later only received 0 vacuum_cleaner .
negative	the supplier ebeez then charged my credit_card the full_amount for one vacuum_cleaner £_000 , even_though i had already paid for 0 at the discounted price through groupon .
negative	i later contacted groupon who said they would refund me however been a lay person i took there word for it and didn_'_t check my statement .
negative	it was only recently whilst doing my personal tax returns i noticed they did not refund me the £_000 .
negative	obviously been very concerned i contacted groupon , i was told the vouchers had now expired so i would not be getting a refund .
negative	i asked where the £_000 had gone and was told very rudely " it '_s in the groupon bank_account and i would not be getting it back " .
negative	i have always purchased vast_amounts of online household products through various online companies with my property business and i can_honestly_say i have never come_across a company that not only legally walks the tight rope but morally have a total_disregard for its customer .
negative	please , please , please think_twice about purchasing anything through groupon , its closest you will get to a rogue trader online .
negative	it '_s not worth with the stress and hassle when things go_wrong , and it will go_wrong .
negative	please also note : double standards : groupon usa will refund your money upto 0 years after the voucher has expired however groupon uk will not refund not .
negative	what a con !
negative	i ordered tickets to a boxing event weeks_ago and paid in full up front .
negative	i have been waiting ever_since and twice queried where my tickets are .
negative	they tell_lies and say that the promoter has not released them .
negative	i know they have cos i know loads of people who have had their tickets in hand for ages .
negative	the status of my tickets has_been showing as ' prepared for dispatch ' for about a week now .
negative	i cannot fathom how long it takes these useless numpties to put 0 tickets in an envelope with my name and address on ?
negative	would never use them again no matter what .
negative	i would rather miss the event altogether than use eventim . co . uk
negative	the initial experience was more than acceptable , with next_day delivery .
negative	however , if you wish to return items , as i did , the nightmare begins .
negative	there is entirely inadequate arrangements for the return of items , lack of communication by all concerned and incompetence on a level which is more or less prevalent wherever you go these days , but nonetheless unacceptable .
negative	this has caused me so much stress and is still not yet resolved , two_weeks after i requested the return .
negative	i am also nearly_£_00 out of pocket on the deal
negative	the hp 00 black_cartridge arrived and the packaging showed a slight leak of ink .
negative	i thought it would be okay but the cartridge is now empty after little use .
negative	i was away for two week in mexico since the purchase !!
negative	!
negative	never again
negative	i have emailed you to report two different packages and i do seem to have the answer i require .
negative	i will not recommend you to anyone .
negative	bough a pair of sunglasses on a groupon deal .
negative	piad for but didnt arrive for a few_days ( fair_enough ) when they did arrive , they were in a jiffy envelope saying signed for but unfortunately they did not attempt to get a signature but instead rammed them through what is a tiny letterbox causing them to break .
negative	i took photos of the damage and sent them to groupon asking for a refund .
negative	instead of refunding , they sent me a ‘ pre_- paid label ’ early may .
negative	i returned them back and now their customer_services rep vishu wont refund me as there warehouse cant confirm status of this return and i need to send them proof of postage !!!!
negative	!
negative	absolutely_appalling service .
negative	do not use – you will only be disappointed .
negative	never use this bunch of rogues .
negative	ive found out a lot about this company the past few weeks which i did not know before .
negative	their head_office is allegedly in switzerland therefore any_problems with tickets have to go through there ( don_'_t expect a quick turn_around either ) i '_ve been waiting 0_weeks for tickets to be returned to me .
negative	information on them can be found around the internet as you will easily pick_up and be able to build a picture about them .
negative	their charges are also extortionate and will do anything to make money rather_than help both the buyers and sellers .
negative	do not , do not under any circumstances order a phone from carphone_warehouse on line or by telephone .
negative	to put it quite_simply .
negative	they lie through there teeth .
negative	i have now been waiting in for my delivery for four days .
negative	each day i have called after waiting in and been promised that i would ' certainly receive the phone tomorrow '- complete lies .
negative	also if you wish to make an enquiry you will have the privilege of having to wait in a queue on a premium_rate line .
negative	without a doubt the worst company i have ever_encountered !
negative	do not use , do not use !
negative	i am now waiting to chat to customer service again and have been waiting in the queue for over half an_hour .
negative	i now prey they go_bankrupt
negative	made my second order through this company and for the second time they are not " able to despatch this order in full " even_though their website said ' in stock '.
negative	very annoying as one of the items was a birthday_present that is now going to be late !
negative	my previous order took them a month to restock , even_though i paid £ 0 for two business day delivery .
negative	the product was fine but was very disappointed with the service quality here
negative	we received our bike in good time and it worked well once and then broke , which i know can happen !!
negative	it is the poor customer service we have received when trying to get a replacement that has_been shambolic to say the least .
negative	people have not returned calls and it is almost_impossible to get through on the phone !
negative	we are still_waiting for a call in regards to how we can get a replacement and i find it ridiculous that you can '_t get through on their phone at all !
negative	please sort your poor aftersales service out !
negative	!
negative	placed an order on the 00st of october , still_waiting for my stuff despite qualifying for next_day delivery .
negative	i was told all items were in stock , and the conformation e_- mail to say my delivery was due on the 0st nov . well , 0 empty tubs turned_up , 0 out of 0 items i ordered , so i waited another day , maybe there had been a mess up .
negative	end of the 0nd of nov , i ring customer_care , theres still no parcels or any information on whats_happening .
negative	they didnt seem to care , but i was told there had been a system error and that my parcel would be here monday0th / tuesday0th .
negative	so i waited , and waited , rang up , and i might_add spend 00_minutes on hold to a business number , only to be told the items i ordered are now not in stock , and they didnt know when they would be .
negative	alas , on thursday0th , i receive an email_telling_me 0 items are due for delivery the next_day .. well , here i am , still_waiting .
negative	only god_knows when ill get the others .
negative	and by looking at the other issues people have had recently , im not alone .
negative	but to make it worse , this isnt the first time things like this have happened .
negative	it gets better , they have taken payment in full !
negative	shame i cant give them my money in installments based on their service !
negative	so by all means , myprotein products are great .. but order your stuff a month in advance , or roll the dice with their stock / delivery promises
negative	i '_ve not had my delivery and can '_t get an answer on when it will turn_up
negative	bought a pressure_washer that had a part missing sent it back and have to wait a week to decide if it will be replaced , absolute_rubbish service .
negative	ordered motor_brushes a week_ago havnt seen them let_me down big time needed them for this weekend only small fit into envolope !
negative	my grandmother hasn_'_t been able to use the internet for 0 - 0 months now and i '_ve spent more than 0 hours on the phone from my mobile as i live a 000_miles_away just trying to get this resolved .
negative	i have also complained 0 times in total 0 phone escalations and 0 e_- mail witch was also reports a breach of data_protection , this was more than 0_weeks_ago and still no response lol .
negative	she has only just had a so - called engineer out who was unable to fix the issue .
negative	as of yet they have not credited her account back anything for lack of service and i am fuming .
negative	i think the office of the information commissioner is going to get a letter soon , off - com as well and lastly a court claim .
negative	how dear they treat my grandmother and me with contempt like that time to come down on talk_talk like a ton of bricks !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
negative	!.
negative	just failed to collect second parcel in a row .
negative	interparcel only have a 0 - 0 weekday number no good when collections go till_0pm and on saturdays !
negative	basically told over the phone to just go direct with delivery company as third_party ( interparcel ) can '_t do any more and lady i spoke with had real attitude .
negative	but i was told to read there terms and conditions interparcel do not guarantee any collections or deliveries ???
negative	?
negative	great help she was !!
negative	!
negative	formal_complaint to be lodged today , as 0 days_later still_waiting on my parcel to be collected cheers interparcel many_thanks !!!!!

negative	i brought a sony docking_station what was £_00 . 00 and i got it home and it didn_'_t work , and it had holes on in the speaker and that didn_'_t show or say in the description on their website .
negative	so i rang them up and then 0lady said someone will come and collect but the it lady wasn_'_t in and then i rang the next_day and now i haven_'_t to pay for posted and packing .
negative	im never buying witg theses again and i would advice no ond to shop with them .
negative	picked a day for delivery and was texted the evening before to tell me they would turn_up between_0am and 0pm (!
negative	), then at 0pm was told they were not coming that day .
negative	they were unable to commit to a time the following_day , so i will have to take another day off work .
negative	hopeless .
negative	please be aware of a0b transfers tunisia , we nearly missed our flight because a0b transfers never turned_up to take us back to the endifa airport from our hotel in sousse , we had a pre_- booked taxi , my wife rang the number of there return booking lines to confirm our return travel over 00 times and no one ever picked the phone up , then we rang the emergency_number after about 00 times someone answered and said ring back in 00_minutes cause it is lunch time , of course we rang back after another 0 times they picked_up the phone , we arranged our taxi at 00 . 00am outside our hotel the following_day , of course we were there at 00 . 00am , by 00 . 00 no taxi , by 00 . 00 no taxi , so we rang the emergency line and a0b transfers said 0 minutes , we waited another 00_minutes , by this time it was 00oclock , our flight was at 0pm and we had over 00 klm to travel to get to the airport , so we rang the emergency line again and a0b transfers said one minute , of course we waited another 00_minutes and nothing turned_up then just in case another 0 minutes lie after lie after lie , in total we waited 00_minutes for our pre_- booked private_taxi and it never arrived , so we had no choice to flag down a taxi on the road side at great expense , we of course will never use this company again , thank_god there is web sights like this where you can warn_others , please be aware , if we can help one person not go through what we did then we will be happy .
negative	they called me after i placed my order to say that some of the laptops they send out are faulty , and without paying a £_00 inspection charge , they would refuse to cover any faults such as pixel loss , which is not deemed as a fault ... on a brand_new laptop ?!?!?
negative	!
negative	sales and customer_services staff sound like they are being forced to take your call at gunpoint and go out of their way to be combative and rude , and try to make you sound like you ' re stupid ( hey , i '_m not the one working in a call_centre trying to upsell for a scam merchant ).
negative	i have now had three follow on calls , even after i cancelled my order trying to upsell some rubbish internet security package without which apparently i will be in grave danger , and it is way better_than norton and mcaffee which they have had a lot of complaints about , apparently .
negative	buy from someone_else , you have the choice , don_'_t waste your time with this bunch of **** s !
negative	march 00st 0000 : order placed and payment taken for £_00 . 00 - two day delivery selected .
negative	april 0nd : received email_confirming delivery due 0rd_april
negative	april 0rd : stayed at home awaiting delivery - nothing arrived :( !
negative	april 0th : spoke to [_name ]( customer_services rep ) explained that i had recieved an email that confirm delivery was due 0rd_april .
negative	he told me this was not possible !
negative	he went to greta length explaining their process and stated it wasn_'_t possible i received such an email !
negative	i sent him the email while on the phone !
negative	april 0th : received an email from [_name_] appologising but stating " customers are only notified once the parcel is scanned by the driver delivering goods !"
negative	clearly focused on disproving me rather_than fixing the problem ...
negative	april_00th : received an email_stating that they had recieved stock of the item but the wrong_colour and would i like to swap to a different_colour !
negative	april_00rd : i replied stating that i ' d like the item i ordered in the colour i wanted oringally .
negative	april_00th : they email me ask me if i '_m like to wait for it to come into stock or if i want to wait ?
negative	april_00th : they ask me if i ' d like to take part in their customer_satisfaction survey !
negative	:)
negative	may 0th : i '_ve emailed them asking if there is any news on the item i ordered in march ( two_days delivery )!
negative	currently_awaiting a reply ...
negative	i recently attended an introduction to studio half day course and learnt about different equipment and techniques .
negative	the elinchrolm system seemed affordable and easy to use and anthony seemed to know his topic .
negative	unfortunately when i decided a couple of weeks_later to order those items i found incomplete parts offered on line ( the train to go with a highlite backdrop , sold as a kit ), i ordered gels to go with the lights but you didn_'_t have the gel holder .
negative	once the gel holder arrived it was too big for the included defuser in the light kit , so i ordered the correct defuser as a kit including 0 grids but when it arrived it was an incomplete kit only containing 0 grid .
negative	i called to ask if the rest was on back order to be told the warehouse had incorrectly listed the products and that it should be 0 times the price .
negative	it would appear that products recommended on training_courses don_'_t seem to be fully briefed to shop staff and that those products don_'_t seem to be fully available .
negative	i sent some cds and books to ziffit but got an email_saying they had not received half of them .
negative	this is impossible as they were all in the same box which was well_packaged .. after several emails sent and being_fobbed_off i received under half the amount of money i should have . 00 days_later .
negative	if i hadnt chased them god_knows when i would have received anything from them .
negative	this is not about money but the fact that someone can just take goods from you and then pay you what they want to . they had previously sent me an email_saying that items were ok then turn_around and say they have not received them .
negative	i wonder_how many_times they have done this scam , as stated in previous emails i will be informing the police and trading_standards .
negative	you people are the scum of the earth
negative	ordered 0 clubs both showing in stock and still are but both out of stock and when i called to ask why and date of delivery was told complete bollox so don_'_t buy from again as this is the second time i '_ve bought from them and both_times poor service .
negative	updateplease read !!
negative	!
negative	this online store is extremely useful ....
negative	please use this online golf store to get other more reputable golf stores to price match these joke prices !
negative	!
negative	i got american a golf to price match the driver these_clowns said they had in stock and didn_'_t so i '_m happy to use these fools like they use our money for cash_flow !
negative	!
negative	ordered a few keys and nearly all have had issues with lastly assassins_creed iii advertised at £_00 . 00 brilliant so put preorder in .
negative	then day before release er there russian keys ( that wasnt mentioned before ) and they dont work in the eu .
negative	refund given without request in store credt !!!
negative	then told me if i wanted a refund then i would lose £ 0 to the company who refunds me lol what a joke .
negative	but the story dosent end there .... then they say weve got keys post them up £_00 . 00 but no way to buy them on the site i ask on facebook how to the as if by magic the price goes to £_00 . 00 and you can buy it what a joke !!!!!
negative	never use these_clowns ever .
negative	i received my itams and the batterie on one did not work and the atamizers were faulty i have emailed three or four times but did not get a reply and i even rang but waited 00 min but got no reply so very disapointed indeed i will wait and see if i get a reply to this email ..
negative	awful to deal with , never again .
negative	i reserved a multi cooker from their maidenhead store ( that i could have had slightly_cheaper from amazon - but i needed the item there and then ) and went to pick it up .
negative	i went into the store , waited a good 0 minutes for a till to become free , and then went to pay for the item .
negative	the sales_assistant asked about protection , and basically wouldn_'_t shut up about it , i wavered and said i think not , and she yelled at me twice " just do it :".
negative	it is only because i needed the item that i went through with the sale .
negative	i contacted customer_care and got an extremely lukewarm response .
negative	i would ensure that none of friends use this company !
negative	the delivery service was very poor to say the least !
negative	i was completely unhappy with the quality and service of my flowers and when i asked for a refund i was told there was i process i had to follow to ensure i basically wasn_'_t lying .
negative	i will never return to this company and will do my up most to ensure my friends and family don_'_t use them also .
negative	waste of my time and my money
negative	ordered thursday for fitting first thing tuesday
negative	arrived 00 . 00 and then were not what i ordered
negative	won_'_t be using these_cowboys again
negative	they left a note yesterday , didn_'_t turn_up as promised today .
negative	different_stories from different " customer service " representatives .
negative	i have no idea if and when the package will ever turn_up .
negative	the second rep i spoke to told me categorically that yodel has no press office - i asked because i write for several magazines on consumer matters such as this .
negative	he told me that someone would phone back about my complaint .
negative	nobody did .
negative	i have since emailed their online publicised press office but don_'_t expect to hear back .
negative	it is shocking that companies such as this are entirely unaccountable to the general_public .
negative	the company doesn_'_t respect the warranty_period , doesn_'_t answer complaints , lies ...
negative	i have purchased several items with wowcher and was happy .
negative	until i bought a bluetooth handsfree carkit .
negative	i thought the deal so good that i bought 0 .
negative	i took the code and entered it into the sellers website .
negative	at this point i paid 0 x £ 0 . 00 for delivery .
negative	i wait and then only bluetooth device is delivered .
negative	so i call the seller ( premium_rate telephone_number ) and they say they will send the second item .
negative	it never appears , but it shows as not redeemed on the wowcher website .
negative	i call the seller again on the premium_rate number and they say they will send it , they never do .
negative	i log on to wowcher and see that the voucher has not been redeemed so i quickly exchange it for a wowcher credit , which i get .
negative	unfortunately i did not see anything i liked for 0 months and they took this credit from me .
negative	also the seller of whom i had paid £ 0 . 00 for delivery of the bluetooth device never refunded my £ 0 . 00 despite several emails and phone_calls .
negative	now i am on their website trying to close my account .
negative	this i think will prove to be an impossible_task .
negative	nearly_£_00 out of pocket for nothing !
negative	!
negative	if you like this type of deals website maybe use groupon .
negative	i have today tried to call santander to speak with them concerning a re mortgage , alas i have not been able to get through and wasted 00_minutes holding !!!!!!
negative	!
negative	besides this someone promised me from a branch of santander to call me and i have received no calls .
negative	this is dreadful service and i feel like taking the business elsewhere ...................... i have no axes to complain_about the banking side of things as they do a great job but on the mortgage side they have a poor rating .
negative	my mother who is 00 years old informed me today she had been waiting for a firstgroup bus from wickwar to bristol for over 00_minutes .
negative	on speaking to the driver of the bus in question he replied they are always running late .
negative	in my view its a dreadful service and the owners of this corporate should be_ashamed .
negative	it obviously comes down to money some where along the line but i doubt if they care .
negative	sounds_like a shoddy outfit run by people who dont care what service they supply .
negative	concerning my recent_visit to your store in la canada , marbella i was returning a sports bra as it turned_out to be the wrong_size for me .
negative	it was still on a hanger with original labels attached and in an m & s bag .
negative	as i had recently been travelling to other_countries on business the said returns were just over 00 days .
negative	i was informed at the store that they could not exchange the goods as they were over 00 days since purchase .
negative	after a continued exchange of words for some 00_minutes in the store with first the assistant and then the manager no one was prepared to help me .
negative	the response from head_office in london was " this is a franchise operation , therefore we have no say in the way they operate ".
negative	seems more like they don_'_t care but a major flaw as there name is somewhat marred now .
negative	in light of the market conditions i can somehow understand some companies lagging in customer service and may be this is just another example of what happens when a total_lack of customer_care is shown .
negative	thankfully there are a number of alternative companies in the market place that sufficiently meet my needs in both food and clothes here on .
negative	waitrose :)
negative	like many people here i was attracted_by the potential saving i would make by sourcing a mobile_phone from this company .
negative	eleven days after ordering the phone i checked the status of my order on their website only to discover that my order had not even been dispatched .
negative	i received no communication about my order whatsoever other than an email_telling_me i had paid them !
negative	so i cancelled the order .
negative	it took three emails before they finally accepted that i wanted my money back .
negative	they offered me an " all - in - one card_reader " in the hope that i would let the order stand and asked for " my patience ".
negative	i declined and have been assured that i will receive a full_refund but apparently this can take " up to two_weeks ".
negative	i '_m not too hopeful reading some of the reviews here .
negative	they say that you can tell the worth of a company by how they treat you when things go_wrong .
negative	and taking up to two_weeks ( or more ) to provide a refund for something you never received in the first place tells you everything you need to know about this outfit .
negative	my only recommendation would be to avoid them at all costs .
negative	and i will be following up this review by contacting_trading_standards if my refund isn_'_t forthcoming .
negative	dreadful experience all_round .
negative	ordered a karcher , washer and hose , no delivery or order history on my account , have not received items so cancelled order 00 / 00 /_0000
negative	order for refund , 0nd payment charge , 00 / 00 /_0000 ,
negative	they owe me two payments for none delivery of goods , poor service from india
negative	put you on hold at your cost and failed to deal with the refund .
negative	very poor service and overlay charged to be put on hold and not dealt_with .
negative	called karcher head_office received a good reply ,
negative	but no real help in the matter .
negative	no better deal than shop deals ,
negative	better to buy in a good shop with good customer service .
negative	after over 000 transactions i '_ve stopped using ebay .
negative	it was once a place for a bargain or a niche product , now it '_s full of traders , used products cannot properly be separated from new ones in the search and you are forced to have a paypal_account .
negative	new auction_sites are springing up , se of which are totally free to use .
negative	once a great place to shop but amazon is now my first_port of call .
negative	they use a sneaky low price to get your domain business ,
negative	then stiff you with a renewal fee 0 times higher_than others -£_00 for 0 small name . com & . co . uk !
negative	and will only give you 0 year renewal periods so you have to pay double ( they are noted in the industry as being horrendously expensive at renewal )
negative	then they want 00 quid for every domain you want to transfer , this is only
negative	reasonable compared to their renewal fees .
negative	then you call them & get the most infuriatingly unhelpful service on the phone -
negative	quotes like " that '_s the company policy " & " our prices are competitive ", despite clear evidenc to the contrary , they refuse to do anything and refuse to pass you on to anyone_else as ' you would be wasting their time ".
negative	go daddy are sooo_much more helpful , a fraction of the cost & up front & honest about their ongong renewal fees !
negative	avoid_avoid_avoid
negative	it comes to something when the staff are actively canvassing the victims , erm " customers ", to complain as the company won_'_t listen to them .
negative	this is beacause they forced all passengers into the worst seats .
negative	all the more spacious ones were empty - for the entire flight - because they have imposed extra_charges on them .
negative	when i requested to move ( my poor other half was squashed between me and another 0 '+ chunky bloke ) i was refused & the seats stayed empty .
negative	i know it '_s cattle class & i should be grateful i don_'_t have to pedal the crappy old planes they fly but i will actually go across the country to another airport to avoid them .
negative	i did complain as requested & was forced by their automated_system to do it in about 00 words - never received a reply .
negative	here '_s some new slogans for them :
negative	" ryanair - when only chav class will do "
negative	" ryanair - making easyjet look posh since_0000 "
negative	" ryanair - because you ' re worthless "
negative	" ryanair - boldly taking customer service to depths no - one has plumbed before "
negative	the parcel was out for delivery on the 0th .
negative	( i purchased my item a long time ago ) the estimated delivery date was the 0th so i waited in all day , no parcel .
negative	i phoned the next_morning and was told that it would deffinately be with me that day and if there were any_issues the driver would call me ...... all day went by and no parcel .
negative	i phoned again in the evening and they actually gave_me the drivers number and when i spoke to her i was told after a large huff that she had just been in my area and that she had finished work for the day !!
negative	she promised to be here just after 0000 this morning and you guessed it ...... still_waiting .
negative	its not like i have a life !!
negative	!
negative	ordered a a boot_mat on 00th_november_0000 .
negative	still_waiting for delivery on 00rd_december_0000 despite 00 ( ten ) phone_calls to the company .
negative	a different_story every time and not one promise kept .
negative	i am starting to wonder seriously if this is a scam .
negative	update , it is now 00 january but still no boot_mat .
negative	colin at mrcarmats promised me a refund and claims that it went through at one minute past ten on 0th_january .
negative	of course it has not arrived .
negative	telephone_call count now at 00 .
negative	avoid this company all they do is take your money .
negative	refund finally received at the end of january , so not a scam but seriously bad service .
negative	i wish people would stop rating this complete scam of a company with 0 or 0_stars .
negative	the fact is yes they are very good / nice / efficient at taking your money and it is cheaper_than other insurance providers , however do not rate until you have actually made a successful claim .
negative	it seems to be impossible to do so .
negative	its all good and well saying " great i get my insurance £ 0 cheaper_than the other_places " however as far as i am concerned i may as well have thrown that money away because im never going to get my phone back .
negative	also when i add up all the excesses charges and phone bills i have used to try and get hold of protectyourbubble then the cost almost outweighs the near £_000 phone that was " insured "
negative	they never phone you back , never reply to emails , you end up on hold for hours .
negative	please_please people mark my words and pay the extra few_pounds for a proper insurance_cover as you will be throwing your money away like i did .
negative	its either giving away £ 0 a month or paying £ 0 - 0 to get some actual insurance .
negative	bought a viseo 000t touchscreen .
negative	i want to mount it onto a stand using its vesa mounting bolts .
negative	to do this , i needed to remove the rear tilt / support ... that went_smoothly .
negative	there are 0 fixed , perspex feet at the front .
negative	no mention of them in the user guide .
negative	not wishing to risk damaging the monitor , i turned to packard_bell ( uk ), customer_services .
negative	oh , they said that they understood my concern ( standard reply content ) and they would look for a solution ( standard reply content ).
negative	this organisation wants their customers to use a charged telephone_number .
negative	the suggested remedies had no relevance to feet on the monitor whatever , mentioning drivers etc !
negative	after 0 attempts to get an answer from packard_bell , they sent a message tellung me that they don_'_t have documentation for the monitor and , that i should take it to a local technician !
negative	who , where ?
negative	contact details ?
negative	this is the pathetic , unhelpful response from the manufacturers .
negative	imho ....
negative	invest nothing in purchasing from this company , they do not deserve your custom .
negative	yesterday , my father visited the asda store on whinbush way in darlington , just as he has done weekly , since it was opened .
negative	on this occasion , he forgot to move his disabled badge to the dashboard .
negative	at the age of 00 , i suggest that this singular oversight is understandable , indeed there are
negative	those , many_years his junior who forget far more .
negative	upon returning to his car with his shopping , he discovered your company '_s chit and immediately attempted to find the attendant , without_success .
negative	that was at 0000 am and by 00 am he had posted a cheque to the company , immediately upon his return home .
negative	i happened to telephone father who was in some distress over the incident and the threat of further_action_against him embodied in the text of the chit .
negative	it took me
negative	sometime to re - assure him and eventually i had to travel to see him .
negative	i discover that in his panic to dispatch this payment to the organisation he forgot to include the
negative	documentation in the envelope .
negative	therefore , it is the case that they have his cheque without supporting_documentation .
negative	i wholly support the safeguarding of reserved car_park spaces for the use of those in need , such as my father .
negative	i abhor this company '_s heavy - handedness that failed to monitor
negative	father '_s return to his vehicle whereupon his circumstances would have been ascertained .
negative	further , the threats and penalties given on the voucher have caused my
negative	father , and i suggest others , significant distress .
negative	my father is an honorable man whose level of integrity has required me to send his details to the company so that they might be matched to the cheque already dispatched and so that smartparking will not upset him further .
negative	what a dreadul set of circumstances , starting with an individual who is so zealous , he couldn_'_t keep an eye on his ' victims ' to ensure there was no element of human_error on the part of a mobility ble card_holder .
negative	i suggest that this would not have arisen if father had been 00 years younger with the build of a hardworking builder !
negative	i did as father asked and e_- maild his details to the company so that they could marry them to his cheque .... have they responded ?
negative	of course not .
negative	i looked for my train_station & where i '_m was goin to ldn '_t find either .
negative	thought i ' d switch from [_external_reference_] to sainsbury ( beaconsfield ).
negative	boy was that a mistake .
negative	a friend of mine phoned and placed / reserved an order for a certain 0 bottles of wine for me to pick_up next_day from customer service desk .
negative	i entered shop ( i wont call it a super - market because nothing is super ), i walked up to c / services desk where there was 0 women dealing_with 0 customer .
negative	i was only one in queue by this time but 00mins later there was a queue_behind me and now 00 sainsburys staff dealing_with 0 same woman .
negative	i said to one staff ...." is this a joke "?.
negative	she said no but we will be with you shortly .
negative	waited another 00mins , by this time there was 00 staff all standing around looking gormless .
negative	in the end i just walked off and went about doing some shopping ( sod the wine ).
negative	when it came to the checkouts , there was about 0 checkouts open and 0 - 0 customers all queued up with trolley fulls .
negative	there were 0 staff stood around the checkouts doing bugger all .
negative	i did give them the benefit of the doubt and returned a week_later to do another shop but i got exactly the same service as before .
negative	i haven_'_t been back since and have gone back to [_external_reference_] where the checkouts are quicker ...... who the hell wants to queue up for 00mins and find their frozen items all defrosted by the time they get to their car .
negative	refreezing food is dangerous .
negative	adios sainsburys ... your cr_@ p .
negative	will be here all day if i wrote about the experience i had with the immigrant i had to deal with .
negative	i won_'_t bother_writing a long review as they are sh0t all_round .
negative	sh0t company , sh0t rude staff .
negative	personally i wouldn_'_t even give specsavers one star .
negative	had my eye_test a couple of months_ago , picked the frames and was told to come_back in a week to collect .
negative	i returned a week_later to find i couldn_'_t see bugger all out of my new glasses .
negative	they offered me another test which i had to return later for .
negative	i retook the eye_test and they said they needed to lower the prescription just slightly and to call them back in a week when glasses were made up again with new prescriptions .
negative	a week_later i returned to same specsavers in uxbridge and stood waiting for ages at front_desk to be served ( i was the only person in line ).
negative	i never said anything before on previous visits but i got quite annoyed this time standing / waiting as there was about 00 - 00 staff all standing around chatting to each other and not actually working .
negative	finally someone actually noticed my face going redder and asked if i needed assistance .
negative	i said i '_m here for the fourth time about my specs and are they ready ?.
negative	the assistant came back with my glasses .
negative	i tried them on and they were still bloody blurry when i try to read anything at arms_length or 00 yards_away .
negative	the assistant said that maybe its because of my old prescription that my eyes won_'_t adjust ...... what a load of old bollox i thought ( i told_him that i especially left my old specs at home so there would be no interference or excuses this time around ).
negative	i told_him to forget booking me back in and that i would just keep the specs and maybe take them out of the box in 0 - 0 years time when maybe then , my eyes might be slightly worse .
negative	he just laughed at me and said yes they will probably work perfectly by then , to which i just got up and left the store .
negative	crap service x0 , crap eye_test x0 , crap everything ... avoid .
negative	booked a hotel through this company .
negative	a few_days_later i discovered that the price i was paying was actually billed in pounds , not euros .
negative	ok , this was my mistake .
negative	however , when i wrote to them explaining this fact , it was too late because their price guarantee only lasts 00 hour !
negative	absolutely_useless .
negative	i tried to explain to their head_office that i could easily cancel the booking without_any charge and book with hotels . com and save myself at_least £_00 .
negative	but they just didn_'_t care because 00_hours had lapsed .
negative	either that or they did not understand because they are based in spain .
negative	i wish i ' d booked with hotels . com because their price guarantee lasts right up to the hotel '_s cancellation window .
negative	brilliant !
negative	not only that , i can '_t even log in to their system to view my booking !
negative	i will never use hotelopia again .
negative	i will never sell to fonebank again , i sent a working second_hand iphone bought from ebay and they said it was stolen !!!
negative	how can it be stolen if i could still make calls with it ?
negative	now they said they wont send it back because i am not the owner !
negative	very silly of them
negative	do not book with credit_card , you will be surcharged and they don_'_t tell you until after the booking is confirmed .
negative	this is devious , and i won_'_t use this company again .
negative	non_existent customer service , i emailed them about a query on my order , that was around the 00th_july , can '_t remember the exact date it was that long ago , today is the 00nd_august and still no reply , don_'_t even try phoning unless you have nothing better to do all day as a long wait is in order .
negative	all i wanted was an explanation to a mistake , seems that once you get the curtains its goodbye .
negative	would not use again and would definately not recommend to any of my friends , they may be cheap , but cheap is what you get in after sales .
negative	in the end rather_than wait for eternity for a response i took the curtains to a seamstress to have them altered , didn_'_t make them so cheap after all by the time i paid for the extra work .
negative	update_:
negative	received a phone_call from woodyatt apologizing for the non reply , they say that they have no record of my query which was sent through their own ' contact us ' tab on their website , what a surprise , also was never asked which number i rang from so don_'_t know how they checked a call log without the number i rang from .
negative	funny how it took a review on trustpilot to trigger a response from them , they got that email ok !
negative	they have even admitted their website needs improved to make it easier for customers but yet i am still out of pocket to the value of £_00 with no offer of compensation .
negative	careful when trying to use the code they send you for registering for their newsletter , after i purchased a song i seen the deal showing 00_% of your first mp0 purchase and applied 00_mins after my purchase .
negative	when i then tried to apply the code it said error , already used , i then complained to their customer service team and was told that it was applied to the song at 00p not the album i was going to buy at £ 0 . 00 . the fact that they hadn_'_t even sent me the code before i tried to purchase didn_'_t even click with them .
negative	going back to itunes .
negative	terrible company , totally_useless !
negative	achica sent me an email with a code to use for my first purchase , a £_00 voucher .
negative	when i tried to use the voucher it said invalid , i emailed them and got a response one day later telling_me to try another code , which i tried and surprise_surprise it also said invalid . after yet again another email_explaining my anger and another day went by , they tell me to go_ahead and place my order and they will refund the £_00 , like i '_ve heard that before !
negative	they now have given me another code to use but now the items i first wanted have ended .
negative	what a complete_waste of time , i wish i had read the reviews about the company first of all and would never have went near them .
negative	my advice , pay a bit more and buy from a well established , reputable_company .
negative	one of the worst companies i have ever_dealt_with , their so called customer service is more like i couldn_'_t care less attitude .
negative	after ordering one of their products they somehow messed_up the delivery address , don_'_t ask me how as the online form was filled in correctly but they say that they used my email address as a postal_address , i mean how daft can you get .
negative	after several emails back and forward i am still none the wiser , they say that the delivery company will contact me but still nothing , i have asked them to confirm what details they have given the delivery company to make_sure they have the correct phone number but still nothing .
negative	if they can '_t get a simple request like this correct it does not say much for the company .
negative	also while all this is going on , not one word of apology from them , hopeless !
negative	!
negative	a complete_disaster from_start to finish , first ordered two bean_bags through groupon , had to wait months to finally receive them , was given a £_00 coupon as a way of compensation which i thought i would give them one more chance to impress so ordered a light , should have learnt my lesson !
negative	every time i get an expected date for delivery it passes by and now going by the recent date it will be one year to receive the light , if it ever arrives !
negative	i have requested a refund twice , still_waiting now nearly two months , so like their products will probably wait about a year to receive .
negative	take my advice , avoid like the plague , you may pay more from another company but at_least you will get your order and avoid all the hassle .
negative	update 00 / 00 / 00
negative	after my post on trustpilot i received a phone_call from emilie who_apologised for the inconvenience and said that she would apply for my refund and process as quickly as possible but it could take up to 00 working_days , so my first thought was , i won_'_t hold my breath , we will wait and see and planned to count the days down .
negative	i received another phone_call today ( 00 / 00 / 00 ) from emilie to update me and said that the full_refund had been put back on my credit_card , so i checked ..................... and yes , a full_refund was back on my credit_card .
negative	so thank_you emilie , you have restored some faith back in infurn !
negative	just made our last amazon order today .
negative	their couriers broke our letterbox in november by ramming a parcel through the door .
negative	we chased them once a week for a follow_up for 0_weeks as each time they promised an update in 0 days time , but and then complete silence .
negative	my wife then spent 00minutes on their 0000 phone being passed through their service centre escalation chain .
negative	the result : a begrudging refund of £_00 for the letterbox cover .
negative	i '_ve placed more than 000 orders with them in the past 0 years , but am so disgusted with their empty_promises to address a simple injustice that i '_m now done with them .
negative	they have a lot to learn about customer service .
negative	grrr .
negative	placed an order 0 days ago on a recorded delivery due wednesday no delivery and despite 0 emails now , not one single response told them i needed it urgently for a birthday_present , so i have reported them to paypal and my credit_card company , wont ever use this company again , and i would not recommend anyone do , customer service is beyond a joke , no respect for the customer just take your money .
negative	so here is my review you go stick your crap company right where it should be !!
negative	!
negative	i hope you go out of business .
negative	i have not receive my item its been nearly two_weeks since i placed the order , never again , i just want my money back .
negative	tried to buy jewellery at end of nov .
negative	paid by paypal and credit_card debited immediately .
negative	nothing arrived .
negative	e_mail and answer machine correspondence repeatedly went_unanswered .
negative	we reported this to paypal who investigated and luckily for us have refunded the money .
negative	useless waste of time
negative	your customer_services_department has just lost you a customer for good .
negative	as an individual and on behalf of 0 gp surgeries i have purchased ‘ 000 ’_s of pounds worth of goods from you over the past years .
negative	i have 0 x_0gb dim0 ram - bought as pair .
negative	0 has_been crashing my computer with memory malfunction .
negative	i have run memory tests on the individual units and identified that one is faulty .
negative	you state that i have to return the pair - which means i will not be able to use my computer . i would have purchased another set from you and would willing have done this for a credit reimbursement when the defective pair had been returned .
negative	e buyer refused - just wanted me to end up with 0 x_0gb_ram which i dont want or need .
negative	i will now purchase something from elsewhere and then return your defective item as apair as requested .
negative	you are in breach of the sales of good act through the unnecessary significant inconvenience_caused entirely by your application of a silly policy .
negative	under the sale of goods_act , the retailer must either repair or replace the goods ' within a reasonable time but without causing significant inconvenience '.
negative	to many stories of accounts being hacked and monies taken
negative	i needed a new parasol and base for the garden - searched the web and found worldstores just what i wanted and at the right price , placed an order and got an acknowledgement almost by return - goods being delivered monday 00th .
negative	interesting that two_separate items had the same consignment numbers - delivery arrived monday as promised and then the fun started only one of the two items on board so contact the couriers who said that worldstores had only sent them one item for delivery .
negative	tried to contact the company and then the fun really began - complaints messages via the website are acknowledged and then nothing more is heard , call their premium_rate number and left on hold for more than 00_minutes and still no human_being to talk to - i am contacting my bank to recover the payment and if this is not possible i shall track down the company ( notice nothing on the website gives their postal_address ( very suspicious ) but there is always company '_s house .
negative	no doubt i shall get an acknowledgement from one of their customer service operatives - but i bet sure as eggs are eggs they won_'_t resolve the problem - perhaps watchdog is the way to go !!!
negative	word of advice to anyone_thinking of purchasing from this company - do not do it - keep your hands on your cash
negative	the only thing i received from bhl was an email to say the delivery date had changed . tthat date came and went over a week_ago and i am still_waiting for the delivery .
negative	i ordered some protein back in may ...... reference 0000000 ( in case anyone at groupon is reading , because they ceratinly arent looking at their emails !!!!).
negative	the wrong item arrived , so i returned it on the 0th_june ..... i am still_waiting for them confirming_receipt , apparently they cant tell if they have received it until 00 days after its return , which is absolute_rubbish .
negative	they are now ignoring my emails and i cant get an answer so it looks_like i will have to resort to going legal .
negative	failing that i will go down there with a baseball bat and wait_until roy blanga , mark hoyt and bradley downes , the owners / directors , turn_up and get the money off them personally !!!
negative	!
negative	shocking company , shocking service .
negative	i have been using groupon for a while and all is good until they send you the wrong item , which they will eventually .
negative	i then had to return it and get proof of doing so .... that was on the 0rd_june , it is now the 00th and they still wont confirm they have had it back because they are returned somewhere_else ...... load of b * llocks .
negative	they are saying if i havent heard_anything after 00 days to get back in touch ...... terrible service and definitely will never use them again .
negative	sorry to say i have not received the locker lock yet .
negative	why i can not tell you ,
negative	moneysavingexpert is full of people who give sub - standard advice .
negative	you are better of researching the subject yourself .
negative	if you say anything in the forums , which the moderator disagrees with you are banned .
negative	rubbish website !
negative	thank_you for your application .
negative	we are busy processing your account and you will receive an email as soon as it has_been activated .
negative	processing normally takes less_than 0 hours but may take up to 00_hours .
negative	if you would like to check the status of your account , you can log in at any time .
negative	you do not need to do anything , we will contact you when your application has_been processed .
negative	this was 0 days ago :( not impressed so_far .
negative	what is going on ??
negative	?
negative	posted a job but them removed as job was filled elsewhere , but they refuse to refund my deposit !
negative	order 0 x aqua fresh iso active toothpaste .
negative	unfortunately both products i received were out - of - date by a year !
negative	bbe date stamp at base of toothpaste can was faded but held in the right light you could just make out the bbe date as 00 /_0000 on both of them .
negative	very disappointing first time experience .
negative	ordered a xerox printer and toner bundle .
negative	the website does not make clear the toner is not genuine xerox toner .
negative	tried to return but they refused to give a refund .
negative	do not use this company .
negative	will be taking this further as the un - genuine toner was miss - sold and they have a right to refund under the distant selling_regulations .
negative	avoid
negative	purchased item and chose option to have this delivered on friday 00rd_august before 0pm .
negative	needless to say there was no tracking_info for this item and dx couriers are the most useless couriers i have ever_encountered .
negative	parcel delivered after 0pm ( had to go out at 0pm ) call couriers an they have advised that cannot collect parcel so wanted to charge for redelivery .
negative	not happy so called the physioroom who advised that i had only paid for the item to be delivered on friday 00rd but not before 0pm as this would have been £ 0 more_expensive .
negative	when i ordered i selected this , i cant be held_accountable that i wasnt charged the correct amount .
negative	called to ask for help to be told nothing we can do .
negative	so i have now had to order product from elsewhere and am now awaiting a refund from thephysioroom ( which i havent had yet !!!)
negative	disappointed as i had been advised thepyhsioroom was a good place to shop but after this expericience i cant say i will be returning .
negative	thanks
negative	marc
negative	switched in october last_year , they initially input my readings incorrectly despite having an email & a phone record of the correct readings , input my mobile number so i can update the readings by text each_month , this has never worked , the web_page never loads properly so i cannot access half of my account details , i can only input gas readings , when i click on input electric reading it defaults to gas , every_month since starting with 0st disaster i have emailed them using their customer service contact us page , i have only ever got the automated_reply informing_me that they will contact me within 0 - 0 days , 0 months on i have not been contacted for my 0st email let_alone any subsequent emails .
negative	customer service is none existent , if you call it is premium_rate so don_'_t do it !!!
negative	even worse than scottish_power as a utility company & that takes some doing .
negative	as soon as my fixed term is up i am out .
negative	i would give minus stars but this is not available .
negative	tackle_uk sent me an item that had been taken out of its packaging and there was a piece missing so i could not use the item they sent me .
negative	they tehn want me to waste my own personal time and petrol money to go into to town to return the item before i can have a refund .
negative	this is not the way how things should be done , you sent me faulty goods so it should be up to tackle_uk to get the item picked_up , not me to send it back to you .
negative	its wrong and wont be dealing_with them anymore
negative	i raised a note ...... question regarding my order delivery , i ' d paid for the most expensive option and 00_hours_later still no reply , this is really bad customer service !
negative	!
negative	i '_ve had many problems with ebay - from people seeling fake goods to bidders bidding on their own stuff .
negative	ebay does not look after its customers - the buyers !
negative	let the buyer_beware here !
negative	my only issue with freestyle_extreme is that considering i have used you before i was disappointed to have been charged for postage on a particular item using credit_card
negative	when the same product was free_postage via ebay at the same price .
negative	slightly unfair i think !
negative	it took over a month and a couple of chase emails to customer_support only to be informed the item i had purchased was out of stock .
negative	i am still_waiting for a full_refund which again i have had to chase .
negative	this experience has put me off buying anything here again even_though their prices are very good .
negative	it is all very well advertising great prices but if you have to wait ages to be told its out of stock and then wait even longer for a refund then any discount is not cost_effective for the purchaser .
negative	still no sign of a refund 0 months later .
negative	having to file a complaint via mastercard to get my money back .
negative	despite sending me an email_informing_me my refund is on its way - it is not !
negative	i am suggesting mastercard consider the complete history of this company in the hope they withdraw its ability to permit them to take payments .
negative	forget trying wae customer_support - they are a joke .
negative	i strongly_suggest anyone considering buying from wae research previous feedback on a number of review and financial websites .
negative	i wish i had .
negative	getting goods and or a refund can prove ery tiresome .
negative	i have been shopping on the internet for years and this has to be the worst purchasing experience to date .
negative	please , please take my advice and buy elsewhere .
negative	its also interesting that wae appear to try and ' block ' all negative_feedback , so it will be interesting to see just how long my review can be read .
negative	avoid .
negative	you have been_warned !
negative	do sign the on - line petition and assist what many others are doing by contacting the various consumer_rights organisations .
negative	if we all keep_up the action we can get wae to account for their activities .
negative	i am off to the small_claims court and will keep you updated .
negative	is anyone_else interested in attending the offices in birmingham together with the local media ?
negative	i requested a new camera charger which i received wrong !
negative	had to wait 00hrs before sending back as i needed a return code from partmaster .
negative	sent back and not heard_anything from them and they '_ve still not contacted me 0_weeks_later .
negative	this is the first time i have used this service and from what i '_ve seen so_far there returns_procedure is very poor .
negative	will attempt again to contact them and see what is happen .
negative	whilst this is all going on there is no mention of refunds for this .
negative	i was after a ps0 for xmas so my elderley mum said she would buy me a game for it .
negative	i told her killzone so off she went .
negative	xmas morning when i opened the game it wasnt actually the retail version it was the version included in the box with the ps0 that cex had clearly taken out ( or it may have even been a trade in ) and sold to my unsuspecting mum who didnt know any better , it wasnt even sealed and the disk had finger_prints on it but yet they still charged her the full retail price of £_00 for a used game .
negative	it wasnt until a couple weeks after xmas that i managed to get in town and to cex at which point i was rudely_told it wasnt their problem cause it was over the 00 days despite the game being purchased dec_00th and me not getting it until the 00th .
negative	not only did they take_advantage of an elderley woman they flat out refused to do anything only suggest i trade it in for £_00 and lose £_00 on a very expensive game never played .
negative	cex are a very poor company and im going to make it my mission to make_sure everybody knows of their business_practices .
negative	tacky tat that is overpriced .
negative	they hide_behind the fact that they sell online so their photoshopped images hide the shoddy condition of the junk they peddle , and when you try and return it , get ready for the circus .
negative	massively disgraceful .
negative	avoid
negative	ordered a sofa last friday after they claim next_day delivery .
negative	stay in all tuesday , the booked and agreed delivery date .
negative	no contact to say its not coming .
negative	i phone them at 0 . 00pm and they say its not coming .
negative	they couldn_'_t be_bothered to get in touch .
negative	very poor service .
negative	first and last ever order from a third rate outfit .
negative	conversation went :
negative	me : " so why has nobody bothered to let_me know its not coming today ?"
negative	them : " i '_m can only say i '_m sorry "
negative	me : " so when is it being delivered ?"
negative	them : " just keep checking the tracking_information every day …"
negative	me : " just a minute … every day ?
negative	you mean you '_ve no idea when it '_s coming at all even_though your website states in stock and available for next_day delivery , and you claim to provide amazing next_day service .
negative	are you expecting me to take the next few weeks off work hoping that it might finally arrive one day ?"
negative	them : " no the courier will phone or text you "
negative	me : " well clearly they haven_'_t bothered to today when it was supposed to arrive .
negative	can you give me the telephone_number for xdp as there is none on their website ?"
negative	them : " no we don_'_t have one ."
negative	me : " just cancel the order then ."
negative	they seem to fail to understand that self - employed people cannot_afford to stay at home all day for something not to arrive as they are not able to be out earning .
negative	these are a bunch of clowns with no idea about prompt reliable customer service or how to perform internet / mail order retail successfully .
negative	avoid and save your time and sanity .
negative	loving all the fake 0 * reviews by people who only have ever written this one amazing review .
negative	pathetic
negative	back in november ordered a sofa from these_clowns .
negative	website states delivery 0 - 0_weeks , in - stock , direct from manufacturer .
negative	telephoned them the day before delivery to confirm all was well and would go_ahead as we were going to get_rid of old sofa .
negative	apparently manufacturer would call us with eta .
negative	delivery day comes and no sofa .
negative	telephoned studio who say they cannot give us the telephone_number for the manufacturer because they don_'_t know who the manufacturer is , but the manufacturer will telephone us as soon as its ready to deliver .
negative	yes you read that correctly - we will be phoned by the manufacturer but they don_'_t know who the manufacturer is !!!
negative	so who have you passed our details to ?
negative	they don_'_t know .
negative	there you have it in a nutshell - studio dont_know who they buy from so they have you waiting in for a delivery but they dont_know who it is delivering it or when its going to come .
negative	so now we have nothing to sit on thanks to complete incompetence from a shocking cowboy_outfit .
negative	don_'_t even waste your time peeps , you '_ll regret it !
negative	i should have read the other reviews on here because clearly studio is not the place to buy a sofa - they seem unable to deliver (_pardon the pun ).
negative	perhaps they should concentrate on selling cards because home furnishings is not an area they are capable of dealing in .
negative	i have now cancelled the order rather_than have any more poor service , lack of information , and general incompetence .
negative	update_: i haven_'_t responded to your reply because as stated i '_ve cancelled the order because you are incompetent .
negative	pretending to care by posting a reply after the horse had bolted is clearly pointless and highlighted by many other reviews .
negative	these_idiots are the nasty people that get hold of your mobile number illegally and text you at all hours of the night and day pestering you about ppi , but dont reply because firstly it will cost you each time you do , and once you reply ( even stop to try and stop it ), they then know that your number works and they will_continue to bombard you and sell on your number to other rogue illegal outfits
negative	these are operating a fantastic money making scheme -- for them .
negative	the way they calculate interest is unlike any other reputable credit_card , and will leave you paying a fortune .
negative	their apr is high , the interest is calulated to leave you paying more interest than your payments unless you pay in full as soon as the bill comes .
negative	this is not the card for anyone who doesn_'_t clear in full , and let '_s face it - they advertise and aim at those that don_'_t .
negative	on their website it states i have a direct_debit set_up .
negative	when i asked for the bank details of this direct_debit they said you don_'_t have one set_up .
negative	so if i hadn_'_t queried this and thought , oh they '_ll take the payment and obviously that wouldn_'_t actually happen , i ' d get charged for failing to pay - and they ' d blame me for thinking their website was accurate with them being a financial institution .
negative	furthermore , if you try and make a debit_card payment online it rejects every time , ring up and use the same card over the phone and it works .
negative	however , if you have tried twice to make payment online and it fails because of their system problems , they refuse to take payment over the phone that day and insist you have to call back another day !
negative	as they charge interest daily , by them refusing to take your payment because of their system problems , you '_ll pay more interest as items are charged from the date they appear on your account , so if it takes you longer to get your money onto the account they are raking up even more interest and its not your fault their systems fail .
negative	as it clearly_states on your statement : " interest is charged on a daily_basis so interest payments will increase the longer you take to pay , even before the monthly payment date ".
negative	what an underhand devious money making scam !
negative	very amateur website that doesn_'_t work and gives misleading information that only serves to make them more in charges and interest by cheating the customers .
negative	if you ' d avoid the likes of payday_lenders like the plague , you '_ll be well advised to avoid these fagans .
negative	when you ask for a quote you '_ll get offers by text and what looks_like a mobile number to ring .
negative	they don_'_t warn you in the text that the call is not part of your free mobile minutes but actually a premium_rate mobile number that will cost you a fortune while you ' re sat on hold or going through the menus .
negative	there is absolutely no warning on the text about the charges of ringing this number which begins " 00000 " and looks_like an ordinary mobile .
negative	if you go on [_external_reference_] com you are given genuine mobile numbers so its easy to think this is the same .
negative	it '_s not !
negative	don_'_t get_stung by the website claiming " receive no - obligation trade quotes on cheap car parts within minutes via_email , text or telephone absolutely free " because as soon as you reply their premium phone line cash registers are ringing up the profits !
negative	if you look them up on companies house , you '_ll see that they change registered address several_times from warwickshire to essex to london , the directors and secretaries are appointed then resign the next_day .
negative	make of it what you will but to me i can '_t really give them the benefit of the doubt that there isn_'_t something sinister here .
negative	you '_ll be seeing them on watchdog soon !
negative	had a telemarketing cold call from 00000000000 .
negative	no idea who it was , did a quick google and discovered it was these_people .
negative	i '_m on the tps register to stop marketing calls and also ex - directory !
negative	further searches revealed this is the same company as yourcalls . net - a shoddy set of scammers also run by the industry named " scumbag " owen bloodworth .
negative	do yourself a favour and keep away - they '_ve changed their name but you know what they say about leopards !
negative	just had some goods sent to me by this company , smashed beyond use , clearly intentional .
negative	couriers like this company deserve to go_bust .
negative	sadly they continue to operate as management clearly don_'_t care about the massive negative attitude of their staff , the loathing they have of customers , the immense negative image this company has .
negative	i now ask online_retailers which company they use .
negative	if its herpes , i ask them to use another courier and if they won_'_t then i tell them i will buy elsewhere because of the courier they have chosen .
negative	if others act the same way either they will lose business and be forced to improve or go under .
negative	this review is not about buying from these_people , but from working for them .
negative	your day will start at 0am and end around 0pm , yet you will only get paid for 0 . 0 hours .
negative	the drivers lose about £_000 a month in unpaid work .
negative	there is no recognised union and so if you complain you will be summarily dismissed .
negative	simply - there is too much to do within the timeframe allowed .
negative	the area covered is around 000_miles .
negative	on a motorway that would take a car about an_hour and a half .
negative	you ' re already now down to six hours paid working time if you could manage that speed !
negative	subtract a further two hours at the depot for sorting and scanning the stock , loading the van , printing out the paperwork and completing van checks and daily / weekly / monthly company sheets and you '_ve only four actual hours to deliver or collect at around 00 locations , thats if you can average driving speeds of 00mph of course ( which you can '_t because of the vehicle limiter @ 00mph ).
negative	the products are " desktop delivery " which means boxes of paper etc have to be taken to the floor level and actual desk / cupboard where the customer wants the product .
negative	which is ok but it takes considerably more time , this isn_'_t just go to the front_desk , " sign here " " there '_s your stuff " and gone in less_than a minute .
negative	especially when only a wonky - wheeled sack cart is provided so sometimes one person collecting over 00 boxes from an above ground level could be at a single drop for well over an_hour .
negative	factor in the 00mph vehicle limiter , the one way systems and ' pedestrian ' and / or ' no loading after 00am ' zones in city centres , or single drops that are nowhere_near any other drop that take another hour just for one packet ( that cannot possibly be cost_effective and would be cheaper to post ) and with an average of 00 drops per day it soon becomes a mammoth task to complete all drops within an effective 0 hours paid delivery window .
negative	the final pettiness of this company though has to be when you take the van to the fuel station .
negative	you are given two cards , a bp card to pay for the fuel and a nectar card - yes they get the points and you have to record the number of nectar_points on your manifest .
negative	they don_'_t even let you have any little perks !
negative	so , in an ethical and moral climate , do you really want to do_business with people who exploit the front line workers ?
negative	was about to order a mac_mini from here .
negative	now i won_'_t because they clearly an non - uk_based and absolutely awful to deal with .
negative	also i note the positive_reviews are by reviewers with only 0 review to their name .
negative	always makes me think their own staff write those reviews !
negative	just paid an extra £_00 and bought it from [_external link_removed ].
negative	it '_s worth_paying a bit more sometimes to go with tried and trusted and have peace of mind rather_than use some scammers .
negative	have been with them about 0 months or so , for broadband and line rental , as they were offering a competitive deal .
negative	thats the positives dealt_with .
negative	the negatives - poor line speeds , regular disconnection , downloads so slow it takes over 0 minutes to load a web_page ( ironically their website support pages at the time !
negative	), low monthly restriction ( allowance they call it - which is both upload and download added together ) which soon gets used up having to press refresh on your browser all the time .
negative	feels_like i spend more time trying to get it working than using it .
negative	found their support useless too , just standard responses and they hide their contact email address so you have to go round in circles through the faq_section which is never relevant to the problem that '_s happening , which meanwhile uses up more of your monthly restriction , oops allowance .
negative	it '_s crap , but it '_s cheap .
negative	so you pays your money ....
negative	if you want good reliable broadband , pay a bit more and go_elsewhere .
negative	if you hardly use the internet and just want it for loading very basic webpages with no flash / media content on it then maybe its the one for you .
negative	for me , frustratingly slow , poor service so ultimately poor value .
negative	after telling them that their broadband is throttled so much and ridiculously slow , and taking up to 0 minutes just to load their own website pages , their answer is that i have to go out and buy another router from the one they supplied or pay for an engineer to visit .
negative	this is their award_winning service ?
negative	what award is this then ?
negative	" biggest cowboy_outfit isp award "?
negative	time to refer them to the regulator as every other poor reviewer on here seems to have to do ...
negative	i would give lower if possible .
negative	ordered a sink they delivered an_alternative without telling_me .
negative	the one delivered was £_000 cheaper and they didnt tell me .
negative	0_weeks_later i am still_waiting for them to collect it and refund my money .
negative	we did not receive any guidance from the staff at all e . g .
negative	length or width .
negative	the carrier once installed would not carry the plastic chain for opening and closing the blinds properly ..
negative	the covers for the end of the blinds kept falling_off .
negative	in the end we cut our losses , took these blinds off and purchased locally blinds at half the price which did exactly the job required .
negative	we originally went for what we thought were upmarket blinds to compliment the new bathroom we had installed .
negative	wrong - worst decision ever made
negative	had booking cancelled due to some security check which they only give you 00hours to comply with ( from a sunday morning in my case ) and then charged me £_00 for absolutely no reason that i can define .
negative	i will never use them again ... ever .
negative	trustpilot is playing very unfair .
negative	it has banned reviews from a company i work for - canvasdezign .
negative	it has left 0 reviews online that are both fake .
negative	they are making it very difficult for us to increase or even decrease our profile .
negative	either start allowing reviews or remove the fake_reviews that are visible .
negative	it is totally unfair .
negative	i was charged £_00 . 00 to have my american_fridge_freezer delivered because they had to take the doors of to get it into my house , when the men set it up in our kitchen they told me when i had levelled the unit up the doors would be level , they won_'_t i e_- mailed marks and was ask to send pictures i did then i was ask to send more pictures , then nothing !
negative	i phoned and got nowhere phoned again nowhere .
negative	they eventually sent 0 men to fix the dish_washer !!!
negative	they saw the problem and said they would report it 0_weeks_later nothing i made another phone_call and was told they would send the problem to the manufacture lg .
negative	lg call and sorted the problem in 00_hours .
negative	mark customer service rubbish
negative	you can only make one booking at a time .
negative	making a second booking has the effect of silently cancelling the first and so you pay full charges for the first booking .
negative	i need to park more than once in a week so i need to be able to make multiple bookings .
negative	i ordered some blank dvds totalling_£_00 .
negative	i never recieved the items and couldnt contact anyone at the company by email or phone .
negative	as i paid via_paypal i have now recovered my lost money so not all bad .
negative	do not use this company .
negative	i dont see how they are still trading
negative	when picking_up our amigo car who we paid 000_euros to , we were asked by gold car for another 00_euros which we thought we had already paid in our total invoice from amigo rental .. we feel we were conned not a good start to our family holiday wont use again
negative	the fast payment statement is a joke as my phone was tested and accepted on the 00th , but i won_'_t get my money until the 00th as it can take up to 0 working_days to send the payment apparently .
negative	i queried this with one of their sales delay team , and was promptly referred to the terms and conditions that i had accepted .
negative	if 0 working_days is their idea of fast payment , i would hate to see their version of slow payment .
negative	sold my last phone to mazuma and it was all sorted in the space of 0 working_days , so it '_s a no_brainer on who i will be using next time .
negative	if you are gonna sell a mobile , don_'_t use envirofone as the currency could have changed by the time you get your money !!!!!!!!!!
negative	!
negative	my dealings with mobilecashmate came as a shock as i had never known such appalling methods to steal from people .
negative	they quoted £_00 .
negative	days_later they said " there were scratches on the phone ...." and offered £_00 ( a 00_% reduction in their quote putting them at the worst price of all purchasers on a price comparison site ).
negative	they also created an artificial , very short deadline that if you did not reject their offer , they would proceed with their new price .
negative	i rejected it .
negative	hours_later they suddenly offered £_00 .
negative	i rejected it .
negative	it took over a week before my phone was returned to me and it had scratches on it that were not there before !!!!!
negative	!
negative	avoid these_people at all costs
negative	i ordered a camera so i could film and take stills of my dads 00th_birthday .
negative	they took the money straight_away , and promised delivery next_day , the camera didn_'_t show .
negative	so i chased them up and was told it would a few more days , when i told them this wasn_'_t sufficient , i cancelled my order and was told my refund could take up to 00 days , this was on the 00 / 00 /_0000 .
negative	i chased camerabox for weeks , eventually i contacted oxfordshire trading_standards to see if they could help , they contacted camerabox a couple of times to see where my refund was .
negative	eventually , i received my refund on 00 / 00 /_0000 , a lot longer_than 00 days .
negative	something should be done about them .
negative	i have kept all email correspondance with them as proof .
negative	paid for , but nothing received , and i '_m still being asked to sign up , what '_s the problem ?
negative	when i want to but a dvd or a book , i want it for 0 price and delivered the next_day .
negative	not what i seem to be getting more and more of - " new or used from 0p delivery within 0 months "
negative	if i wanted a used one , i would be at a boot sale .
negative	with myprotein receiving such praise from other people who have ordered from it , i set my hopes quite high for the product .
negative	however , i was completely let_down .
negative	the protein will not mix properly with water , instead the water turns a horrible yellow colour that looks and tastes disgusting .
negative	the protein is completely unusable .
negative	booked 0 parcels to be collected .
negative	paid for it and ordered it on the sunday_evening .
negative	email stated that it would be collected monday between 0 - 0 .
negative	stayed in all day waiting for ups to collect .
negative	failed to appear .
negative	dyson actually searched around the internet for a part for me , called me to say there was a part in stock at espares . co . uk , so i went to the website , checked that it was definitely in stock and placed the order with an expected delivery date of 0 to 0 days .
negative	two_weeks_later , i call them ( note , not the other way round ), only to be told that suddenly the part is out of stock , that someone must have coincidentally ordered the same ( very rare ) part at exactly the same time .
negative	the guy on the phone told me i didn_'_t understand how stock worked , but if he knew what i did for a living , he ' d be embarressed .
negative	so how long would they have left it before calling me and offering to return my money ?
negative	do i believe the coincidence of someone biuying the same part a nano second before me ?
negative	meanwhile , espares . co . uk have had my money in their possession , all be it a small_amount , but if this happens to many people , that can add up .
negative	was the part really , truly , in stock when i ordered .
negative	doesn_'_t smell good , so won_'_t be ordering from them ever again .
negative	i will not be using cash_generator again .
negative	i was sent a faulty ps0 which i later sent back .
negative	the shop sent a courier which i though was good and i was happy with that .
negative	they also told me that they would get a replacement sourced and sent out to me .
negative	i emailed them a week_ago and they guaranteed my new ps0 would be here by monday .
negative	it is now tuesday and they have stopped answering my emails and i have the feeling that like many other people , i will not be hearing from them again .
negative	thank_you cash_generator for your terrible service and causing my brother to go without a birthday_present .
negative	i have taken four flights last_year with ryanair , two to portugal from doncaster and two to dublin from birmingham .
negative	the two to doncaster were perfect , great staff i got what i paid for .
negative	the two to dublin were never again to be repeated i will fly with air lingus from now on .
negative	scumbag company as many other_reviewers have said .
negative	i '_ve been unable to obtain a refund for a cancelled order and have been palmed off with " we are processing your refund " e_- mails from someone called leslie grant .
negative	looks_like i '_ll have to write this one off as a bad_experience - the first time i '_ve had any_problems buying online .
negative	the company does not have a postal_address ( because it is clearly not a uk company ) and its customer_services are a sham .
negative	don_'_t buy !
negative	!
negative	until recently my experience with 000reg had been ok and i never had any_problems with the few domains i '_ve registered with them .
negative	however , i logged in to update a domain i own with them to redirect to a blog , but the domain had gone .
negative	i paid 000reg to renew the domain , but they failed to pay the registry so the domain was lost .
negative	a third_party bought it and wants $ 0000 for it !
negative	i am not paying $ 0000 for 000reg '_s mistake , and to make it worse their support staff have been completely dismissive & try to avoid taking responsibility at every opportunity .
negative	they even have the audacity to tell me they failed to pay the registry , but the loss of the domain is my fault for not checking with a third_party that they did their job !
negative	this example shows serious incompetence and a lack of care for customers when they make a mistake .
negative	any domain registrar should know how to renew domains without losing them , and in any case of a renewal failing they should at_least detect this so that action can be taken .
negative	000reg failed to do their job here and try to escape responsibility so they don_'_t need to pay for their mistake .
negative	i could forgive a mistake if they made up for it , but their attitude is unbelievably bad .
negative	atrocious customer service & incompetence .
negative	i will try to transfer all of my domains away from this terrible company !
negative	i had my phone stolen a month_ago ... just received a letter from protectyourbubble telling_me my second appeal has_been denied !!
negative	!
negative	dont believe in paying lesser for your phone insurance !!!
negative	other_companies might charged higher monthly premium but at_least they replace your lost / stolen or broken phone fast !
negative	protectyourbubble says that it '_s due to my carelessness that my phone got stolen and they wont replace it for me .
negative	which idiot actually leave their phone lying_around so it can be stolen ?
negative	someone please tell me what it means when i pay certain_amount of money every_month to protect my phone against being stolen ?
negative	for the second time i '_ve had the same problem with yodel , after 0 delivery attempts i waited in all day today for them to make the 0rd .
negative	at about 0pm i decided to look at the tracking_info and it had been returned to the service centre after a failed 0rd_attempt !!
negative	categorically no attempt was made and no card was left !!
negative	after trying to sort it out with customer_services i just got fobbed_off with with " we have made 0 attempts so i will now have to collect " !
negative	!
negative	that would be a 00 mile_round_trip !!
negative	as with all the other comments , avoid this company at all costs .
negative	i will be complaining to amazon us who the parcel is from , to make them aware of what happens when they send a package to the uk .
negative	yodel are ****!
negative	!
negative	took 0 days to not tell me they didnt want the business .
negative	refunded the money ( hence the 0_star ) but promised to do the job and then quietly refunded the money without informing_me .
negative	wasted 0 days waiting on promise after promise they would do it .
negative	then claimed they didn_'_t know who i was .
negative	at the end of the day they were only 0 %_cheaper_than a main_dealer who did the job in 0 hour on the spot .
negative	don_'_t waste your time .
negative	i booked some tickets to see pat metheny at the hammersmith apollo in june .
negative	i booked them in march - a month_ago .
negative	as well as paying for the tickets i paid over £_00 in booking and postage fees .
negative	rather excessive i thought but at_least it should guarantee good service .
negative	oh no it didn_'_t .
negative	the tickets were confirmed as shipped a day or so after i bought them , but a week_later i hadn_'_t received them .
negative	i got in touch with eventim who said that it i waited_until 0 days before the event they ' d arrange for me to collect them on the night .
negative	i pointed_out how foolish it would be to cut it so fine given that things obviously had already gone_wrong once .
negative	i asked them to send them out by recorded delivery instead .
negative	failing that they could make them available for immediate collection at the venue and refund their fees .
negative	i got an email back telling_me what their policy was as if that was a genuine reason_why they couldn_'_t carry out a simple recovery operation for lost tickets as and when circumstances necessitated .
negative	so i phoned them up .
negative	after_speaking to another policy - parroting zombie i was handed to a manager who first attempted to fob me off with the same nonsense about policy and then tried to suggest that it was there to prevent ticket fraud .
negative	the best i could get out of her was a promise to contact the venue and ask what they would allow the ticket agents to do .
negative	much later in the day i received an email from her saying the same stuff with which she and her colleagues had tried to fob me off .
negative	i wrote back very angrily outlining why this was unacceptable .
negative	i should not have to wait months worrying_about whether i would gain admittance after paying over £_00 in fees for a service that should alleviate any such worry .
negative	i got a reply a week_later from another customer service manager , stuart james , just repeating the same nonsense again .
negative	naturally they will not refund the booking or postage fees , and had the cheek to claim that it was because they are making them available for collection at the last_minute , and that collection fees are the same as postage (£. 000 ).
negative	i '_ll be royal_mail are glad that they are providing their services for free .
negative	it has occurred to me that the choice not to make tickets available for collection until the very last moment may be to enable them to resell the seats to someone_else at a higher price , and then give me a refund so they can make a profit leaving me none the wiser .
negative	verbally abused by shop owner at paul '_s newsagent , chislehurst .
negative	on previous collection visits , i have been asked sarcastically why i was only collecting a parcel and not buying additional products from the shop .
negative	owner told me , the only reason he ' d signed_up to collect_+ was to make additional money from people coming into his shop and buying additional goods .
negative	today , i was angrily told that because i collected a parcel only , i was no good to him .
negative	he then_proceeded to verbally abuse me .
negative	i was mortified and disgusted .
negative	collect_+, your parcel service works very well , but you need to assess carefully the shops that you use .
negative	terrible .
negative	0 ) trying to get a full invoice for my goods ( as it was split in to 0 consignments ) was immensely difficult and customer service at this point was appalling to say the very least .
negative	0 ) the products themselves are very poor quality compared to other internet stores .
negative	shower_valve had very little tolerance when installing and tiling , in particular back to wall toilet are not fit for use as you need to remove the whole toilet from wall when carrying out a menial task such as cleaning or changing the toilet_seat .
negative	0 ) technical and customer service in regard to the toilet_seat problem did not want to know , asked for a follow_up call from a manager , did not receive anything !
negative	0 ) shop with victoria_plumb .
negative	totally different quality when compared with these_cowboys !
negative	basically i bought a premium grade card folder that was then bent into shape to fit into a box with a table top game .
negative	the item will now likely always have a slight curve to it due to this .
negative	so it was cheaper_than else where but the packing sorely let them down .
negative	they have got to be one of the worst companies to deal with when it comes to changing or ending a contract , even after 0 hours of trying to get them to cancel my contract and being told that i was making " the wrong decision " by leaving them and that leaving them for a rival carrier was " stupid ", they still didn_'_t even do what i asked them to do in the first place which was end my rolling_contract , which resulted_in me having to phone them again , and of course going through the exact_same stuff and tripe that their staff have to come out with .
negative	all in all they are a horrible company to deal with , don_'_t be suckered in by their cheap deals as what you may have saved in money , you pay for in time , effort and stress with having to deal with rude and frankly incompetent staff .
negative	do yourselves a favor and go with a different carrier , 0 are a shambles of a company .
negative	it '_s really rare i am disappointed enough to take valuable time writing a negative_review , but ... parcel0go may be fine if your parcel arrives ok but if it does not , then best of luck trying to resolve the problem .
negative	luckily i opted for the insurance but it has still been painful .
negative	they ( or more accurately city_link ) lost my parcel , even_though i had attached a clear , printed address_label sealed under clear packing_tape .
negative	the parcel was a set of used brake calpiers from my classic car on route to being refurbished .
negative	ok ... so these things_happen once in while , but :
negative	- you can '_t phone them ( they have no numbers )
negative	- it '_s not that easy to find how to reach them via im live_chat ( try it for yourself )
negative	- the web_page for managing the insurance claim is appalling ( no immediate feedback when uploading docs , status of claim does not always get updated and no email_notifications - you have login and check progress , even if they are waiting on you )
negative	- almost 0 month since the original parcel was lost and still not settled ( and of course its not easy to discuss )
negative	great example of a large company who are focussed totally on cost at the expense of working with customers when issues_arise ( as they do with even the best of businesses ).
negative	they claim they are number 0 , well yes they are if you ignore the other 00 providers above them , what they mean is that they are no 0 of the big six companies with a customer_satisfaction score of just 00 %.
negative	for those that want the facts they are joint 00th with sainsburys .
negative	been with them for many_years - indeed was with them under their old name of powergen , never had to deal with customer_services until january_0000 , my gas bill has always been high but as i was away working i didn_'_t know how my wife and daughter used the gas - i just paid the bills , however , daughter has bought her own home and moved out and i have now retired - so i can see just how energy is being used .
negative	on the eon website their comparator indicates i use 000_% more gas than similar homes in my area - i had several discussions with eon as to how that is possible - they offered little help , however i decided that the gas_meter must be faulty , eon said they would change the meter but if its proven to be accurate then i must pay £_000 for the change .
negative	i was so convinced i was right that i accepted the change , - long_story_short - i was right - my meter was reported as reading " erroneously " and the percentage of over reading was documented - this was in march_0000 and despite me making contact many_times about a settlement from them they have made no offer to compensate - indeed i just get the normal " we are so sorry you are having a problem with us " emails .
negative	i have referred my complaint to the ombudsman just to get them to respond - and then i see they make the news with a 00 million_pound fine for ripping its customers off - so just how long my claim is going to take is anybodys guess .
negative	i accept any company can have problems and don_'_t always get it right , but when they have had so many opportunities to rescue defeat from the jaws of success i wonder just how deep the delusions of adequacy runs in this companies management .
negative	i have little choice but to move provider and they will discover that when they next apply for the direct_debit - and get refused , i just hope they get in touch so i can give them a taste of their own medicine - cant respond in less_than 0 days , will assure them something has_gone_wrong and i will sort it out - then ignore them until they next get in touch - perhaps they will then understand just how frustrating it is having to deal with people who don_'_t give a damn .
negative	sorry i couldn_'_t give them less_than one star on the review - they deserve nothing .
negative	****_update ****
negative	so here we are many weeks_later , ombudsman involved and i have a new supplier and still no obvious progress , final_bill with them now paid - i had over £_000 in credit and after settling the final_bill at changeover time they owe me £_000 , rang them and they can only send a cheque to pay me , i asked why they cant simply credit my account - they have the details from the direct_debits - sorry cant do , we are only allowed to send a cheque .
negative	so could this be the dying desperation to keep the money in their bank for as long as they can ?
negative	eon - i hope your reading this , i wouldn_'_t return to you even if you started providing free gas and electricity , i hope everyone wakes up to your inadequacies and desert you .
negative	dumping you is easy , i did this with bt many_years_ago and would never return to them either - i always stick to my word
negative	i had been told i would get £_00 for my 0gs .
negative	it failed it '_s test due to a key scratch on the back and they had the cheek to reduce it to £_00 !
negative	i wanted it returned but this would cost almost £ 0 , they are based in london so i said i would rather collect it myself and they refused .
negative	reluctantly i accepted the offer and 0_weeks_later i '_m still_waiting for the money to be put in to my account .
negative	they are an_absolute_disgrace , lure you in with a high price and then knock you down .
negative	after paying for and placing an order with tredz i received an email_telling the item was out of stock and i would have to wait two_weeks and asking me if i want to proceed with the order ?
negative	having cancelled the order the item was still sent to me a week_later .
negative	tredz admitted it was their mistake and said send the item back for a refund .
negative	this cost me £ 0 . 00 .
negative	a day later i had an email_saying they had received the returned item .
negative	a week and a half after that i had to chase them for the refund .
negative	i received the refund later that day but without a refund for the return postage .
negative	just plainly incompetent and not interested in keeping_me as a customer .
negative	avoid !
negative	charged for goods they did not have .
negative	took_ages and many many emails to get part refund .
negative	charged for ' free ' glasses .
negative	can only contact online .
negative	only got part refund when i threaten to report them to my bank .
negative	avoid like the plague !!
negative	!
negative	this is the worst customer service i had to deal with !
negative	there was an issue on their website and charge me twice for an event .
negative	they refused to refund me the money .
negative	stay well away from them !
negative	i had my shelves put up and discovered they were not the size i ordered !
negative	can '_t get any response about a refund of the balance as i can '_t be_bothered to take them down and send them back .
negative	emailed twice but no reply .
negative	ordered flowers in good time for delivery for valentines_day , only to be let_down big time by inter_flora got email_stating due to high_volume of orders they were unable to fill my order .... i will never use this company again and advise anyone_else not to
negative	ordered items from this company , waited a week then was told item out of stock after i called them , but was told would be in stock with in 0 days and order would completed , waited another week still no item , called them again only to be told item still out of stock but would be in that day .
negative	another week has_gone past and still nothing called a third time and told no sure on when stock would be in .
negative	total_waste of time and although item cheaper_than else where i would rather pay the extra and get items delivered with in a week not 0 plus weeks .
negative	will never use this site again and would advise others to avoid like the plague
negative	shocking customer service .
negative	i have been unable to access my online talktalk account for over a month despite_numerous_emails & phone_calls .
negative	if your looking for a service provider i would strongly_urge you to look_elsewhere !
negative	purchased a vehicle workshop_manual online download .
negative	it was supplied in some unknown format for which you are then pointed towards a further software download in order to make it work , this software then will not load properly and i am still left with a product i can not use .
negative	i would steer_well clear of this company .
negative	ordered my giffgaff simcard put it into my smart phone , purchased £_00 top up credit and a £_00 goodybag which gave_me unlimited_internet , unlimited_texts , and god_knows_how many free phonecalls for a month .
negative	the first 0 days i checked my account balance , it was still £_00 all well and good showing all calls i made were coming from the £_00 goodybag add on just as they should .
negative	all of a sudden 0st august , balance dropped to £ 0 , i contacted their online help agent who informed me that i dialled a premium number 000000 on 00 july at 00 : 00 & 00 seconds whilst i was in bed and the phone was downstairs with no other person having access to it , this call cost £ 0 .
negative	i did not make the call , i have no idea or interest who is on the other end of 000000 , what a con , needless to say once my credit runs out with giffgaff i will be putting another networks simcard in my phone and they won_’_t con any more money out of me .
negative	i advise you to beware of this network before your pocket gets hit .
negative	if i could give them minus 0_stars i would .
negative	i was promised a replacement for my sons playstation 0 .
negative	i recieved a text_message from sony informing_me that the new console would be delivered between_0am to 0pm .
negative	as i could not take the time off work my mother took the day off and waited in all day .
negative	they didn_'_t even bother to turn_up !
negative	this is the second time i '_ve had a parcel promised via_dpd and the second time they never bothered to turn_up .
negative	the contact_numbers are hidden for the local depots so you cannot call them to chase them up .
negative	a disgusting serivce .
negative	i '_ve now had to tell my son that i have no idea when his playstion will arrive because it '_s been left in the hands of lazy good for nothing drivers !
negative	i then had to explain to my mother that she has wasted a days holiday also .
negative	dpd / parceline ipswich you should be_ashamed of yourselves .
negative	i ordered my party goods and decided to choose the premium £_00 . 00 saturday delivery option as my party was on the sunday - well the parcel never arrived in time !
negative	not on ; y did it not arrive on time , but i had to follow_up on when it would arrive , and was told by james that it would arrive on the tuesday - and it never arrived again !
negative	i had to then telephone back again , and was told by shilpa that it would be with me on the wednesday - i had to do all the calling and following up .
negative	the parcel did eventually arrive late wednesday_afternoon , but the party was over !
negative	i will not be using their services again - poor customer service ...
negative	sales staff are only interested in one thing selling you what they get the most commission out of and not what you need and customer_care is dreadfull
negative	please avoid like the plague , they sold me a tube of £_00 cream that was torn at the base of the nozzle and i am still fighting them for a refund .
negative	i originally asked for a replacement , but when it became_clear they were ignoring me , i requested a refund .
negative	almost a month on , i still_haven_'_t got it .
negative	ability superstore contacted me and gave_me a full_refund i applaud them vigourously for the attention they gave_me and their politeness . once again thank_you !
negative	!
negative	the website information on delivery timeline was incorrect .
negative	next_day actually meant up to 0 days .
negative	i only found this out on the day i was expecting the delivery and had changed my plans so i could take receipt of the goods .
negative	:(
negative	they have processed my refund quickly , but just not good enough in today '_s e_- commerce environment .
negative	totally_satisfied with deepblue , i have ordered a number of items of dive_equipment during the last four years and have no_compaints about the service , the equipment , or the response from the crew of deepblue .
negative	i ordered a product that was " in stock " and was a bit disappointed when i learnt that it would take 0 - 00 business days ( i . e .
negative	0_weeks ) to deliver , but the price was very good and i wasn_'_t in a hurry .
negative	after 0_weeks i checked the status , and found that the order said " stocking difficulties " and the product page showed the item as out of stock .
negative	i rang for an update and the phone rang for 00_minutes with no answer .
negative	i submitted a support query through the website and it took 0 days to get a response .
negative	my credit_card was charged the day i made the order , despite the product not being in stock , and will now take " up to 00 days " to be refunded .
negative	avoid them like the plague .
negative	i ordered a canon_lens converter from this company specifically for a holiday i was about to go on .
negative	nearly 0_weeks_later my order had still not been sent despite_numerous e_- mails to the customer_support_team and my order having supposedly been raised to ' priority ' status .
negative	dread to think what happens to non - priority orders !
negative	i have now given up any hope of the lens converter arriving in time for my holiday if it arrives at all .
negative	i have therefore asked for my order to be cancelled and an immediate_refund be made .
negative	no doubt this will suffer the same_fate as my order .
negative	rarely have i come_across such abysmal service , incompetence and lack of response .
negative	a simply dreadful experience which i would like to spare others .
negative	their prices may be cheap but their logistical organisation and response is woeful .
negative	better to pay more and get the item you want than spend hours trying to find out what on earth has happened to your order .
negative	placed and order for 0 sets of mothers_day flowers .
negative	however , having ordered one of the recipients decided to take a holiday .
negative	i first called on wednesday_evening to be told by an asian gentleman that i had to call back during british daytime .
negative	i couldnt call on thursday but called 0st thing on friday_morning stating i wanted to cancel part of the order as no one would be there to receive the delivery .
negative	i was told this wasnt possible , i stated the person is going on holiday and wont be in !!
negative	the operator said she understood and would speak to the florist and would call straight back .
negative	i made a point of checking they had the correct number , which they did .
negative	still_waiting on phone_call and i am guessing the delivery was attempted on sunday despite no one being in the house .
negative	have used iflorist many_times in the past , but this has put me off big time .
negative	only getting 0_star as thats the minimum allowed .
negative	0 out of 0 for customer service on this occasion .
negative	the 0nd part of the order was delivered as requested but the flowers by no means matched up to what was ordered - very small for the money paid .
negative	pretty dissapointed all_round
negative	the online enquiry_form is useless .
negative	despite several_attempts at contacting them via it i have still to hear back from them despite their 00hr response time promise .
negative	i also find their livedrive offering pretty poor on the mac .
negative	the inability to just let a contract lapse also is frustrating .
negative	you have to cancel otherwise they will renew the subscription automatically .
negative	when you cancel you do from that point not from the end of your subscription .
negative	poor experience for the whole product and service .
negative	i would definitely never recommend them .
negative	i am unable to comment since the item i ordered has not yet arrived .
negative	oh_dear , it seems as if i '_m not the only one suffering with this retailer '_s poor customer service and deliveries .
negative	ordered an item on june 0th , which i '_ve still yet to receive .
negative	despite contacting the retailer on june_00th , 00th and 00st , i have received a single reply on the 00th to advise they are investigating .
negative	however , i '_ve yet to receive a reply since then , and am now out of pocket as there is no item and they have my money .
negative	avoid at all costs - despite their previous positive_reviews , it appears in the last few weeks they are not delivering items .
negative	do not order from them .
negative	i sent back a item for a full_refund under dsr more than a month_ago , i still yet to receive a refund which they keep saying they will process yet don_'_t !
negative	they never reply to emails , i have to ring them up to contact them .
negative	i was threatened on the phone that i will not receive a refund if i keep calling them about it , and i was also called a idiot on the phone !
negative	ever_since the hut_group took over this company customer service is terrible , scam_artists !
negative	avoid like the plague
negative	as above .
negative	very disappointed .
negative	will not use again .
negative	what the hell is wrong with this company ?
negative	i ordered £_00 worth if items , and as i never used this company before , they offer an option to not register during checkout .
negative	good , i thought , because i only could get the one off items i needed from this place .
negative	go through with it , goes through fine .
negative	do get an order number page at the end , blah_blah .
negative	i ignore it since i gave my email .
negative	got no comfirmation email or anything .
negative	checked account and money was taken out within 00_hours .
negative	( went from pending to taken ).
negative	emailed company asking the status of my order and my situation on having no order number or anything emailed to me .
negative	gave name , address , etc .
negative	they claim no order for the name or address was ever processed .
negative	never got a reply from them ever again , and still have my money and refuse to accept they have taken money out of my account .
negative	so then , what is this chemistdirect for £_00 doing on my credit_card statement then ?
negative	and why am i £_00 short .
negative	this company is the worse i have ever used online .
negative	utterly_useless and just pure thiefs .
negative	il 0 novembre , ho_acquistato uno speaker bluetooth dato come disponibile sul sito .
negative	fiducioso e ingannato dai commenti positivi , non_ho esitato ad effettuare l ' acquisto , solo dopo mi_sono accorto che i veri commenti erano tutt ' altro che positivi .
negative	ho avuto fino ad ora una sola risposta riguardo alle false tempistiche di spedizione , dopo due giorni da ordine effettuato .
negative	poi più nulla fino ad un messaggio il 00 novembre dove mi si diceva che l ' ordine dallo stato di " pagamento ricevuto " passava a " in preparazione " e nelle successive 00 ore dal ricevimento di questa e_- mail avrei ricevuto il numero di tracciatura che_non e ' mai arrivato .
negative	da allora attendo ma senza speranze , nel frattempo ho mandato a questa " indefinibile " azienda diverse e_- mail per avere notizie e per far sapere che avrei cominciato con azioni legali nei loro confronti .
negative	sembra che a loro non interessi , visto che_non sono mai stato contattato .
negative	mi rivolgerò a breve alla polizia postale per rendere noto l ' atteggiamento a dir poco sgradevole di quest ' azienda e_- commerce .
negative	i was with aol from the days of compuserve and had always raved_about them ; their reliability , speeds , customer service .... oh how times have changed !
negative	!
negative	my complaints began about 00months ago with emails i sent not being received and no bounce backs ( this caused a lot of trouble and i lost business as a result ).
negative	aol blamed everything from filters to the router to windows , basically anything_else apart_from them .
negative	i '_m quite geeky so when i caught them out at each point they finally , after many calls over 0 months offered to upgrade my service and send a new modem - all i ' d have to do was sign up to a new contract .
negative	i argued them down in price instead and eventually got the deal i was happy with and ( stupidly ) accepted .
negative	of course the problems were never resolved , the indian based staff are clearly dragged off the street , given no training and are just plonked infront of a 00 '_s era pc with a script to read from .
negative	they have no clue what to do , are unwilling to escalate and their two main functions are to :
negative	a ) get you to sign up for another contract - preferably with line rental .
negative	b ) get you off the phone by telling you any lie they can think of , or as a failsafe that you have come through to the wrong department and they can '_t transfer you .
negative	my main issues were with email not being received , but this didn_'_t worry them .
negative	i was promised call_backs , escalations , uk_based technical_team visits ..... nothing .
negative	what really angered me were the constant_lies , when you have been a loyal_customer for 00 years , you expect better treatment that this .
negative	i left in march and have not looked back .
negative	one of their original lies told to me 00months ago was that if i left them they would also delete my screen name and i ' d lose my aol . com email address - this is a lie .
negative	if , like me , this is a reason to stay , rest_assured , they don_'_t .
negative	i went to the extreme of changing everything away from my aol email but when my cancellation was complete , my email and screen name have remained active .
negative	basically the lesson_learned is that they are a bunch of clueless liars who want your money and no_longer care about the customer .
negative	i '_m now with orange as i also have my mobile contract with them and although others may complain_about them , i '_ve found them good .
negative	sky are attractive if you stay on their good side , but my advice would be to go with o0 who seem to have the best customer_support and that is what you need if things go_wrong .
negative	this company are extremely unprofessional .
negative	they make promises they can '_t keep .
negative	they are slow with postage .
negative	even if you pay for express .
negative	they didn_'_t repay me customs charge which they promised they would .
negative	they ignore emails .
negative	this company should not be allowed to trade .
negative	my dad paid my flight and expenses as a pleasant_surprise to see my friends new baby .
negative	flight was good .
negative	pickup car in belfast was good .
negative	then , i was asked to pay another £_00 for " insurance " so in a nutshell , you guys took all my spending money .
negative	my dad was furious and rang your office .
negative	" everyone does the same sir !".
negative	no they do not .
negative	the truth was in your " small_print " as was pointed_out to me .
negative	i would rather walk than use you again ./ anyone reading this , i would say beware .
negative	i hope no one uses your services .
negative	won_'_t use again !
negative	terrible service and a rude staff_member .
negative	nothing else to say other than avoid them .
negative	i sent my blackberry cold , and i still_haven_'_t received my cheque for payment .
negative	you can view my reviews under webuy . com
negative	wecertainlydontcare @ webuy . com would be more appropriate in describing cex
negative	gerard corlay
negative	how many emails does one have to send to get a reply from cex wecare ??
negative	@ webuy take your money quickly . com
negative	i was originally very impressed when sending in 00 xbox games for sale and opted for the e_- voucher as i wanted games from their listings .
negative	what a lot of hassle trying to reedeem voucher for £_00 . 00 which was posted recorded delvery to their e_- commerce dept .
negative	as instructed in their terms & conditions , received and signed for on behalf of cex at 00 . 00am on 00th of feb receipt confirmed by conrad of cex on 00th of feb via_email to myself .
negative	to this date 00th of march , my bank has still not received the £_00 . 00 rightfully owed , nor have i had any response to umpteen emails since feb_00th !!
negative	!
negative	the 0 games i ordered value £_00 . 00 for which my visa_card was debited for on 00th of feb duely arrived over 0 days 00 , 00 & 00th of feb impressive !
negative	shame i can '_t say the same about their e_- voucher system and their email repsonses to queries !!
negative	!
negative	future dealings with webuy . com cex ?
negative	lets_see what sort of response , appology , recompense , good old_fashioned customer service i get because at present it looks highly unlikely !
negative	g . corlay .
negative	( not a happy_bunny )
negative	had relply from conrad at cex webuy . com today 00th of march at 0 . 00am
negative	quote : we can confirm that we have received the voucher and it will be processed at the earliest .
negative	exactly the same as was emailed to me on 00th of feb by the very same person !
negative	no mention of other emails sent to them or any kind of definitive answer to the ongoing saga !
negative	this kind of " after " sales service is appalling , not to mention illegal and against their owm policies / terms & conditions .
negative	shame really because their choice of goods , prices and delveries are amongst the best but oh , the total disrespect to after sales customer service is one , if not , the worst i '_ve ever come_across !
negative	!
negative	so , after ignoring my other emails in which i mentioned taking_legal_action , i have replied to this latest email from conrad at webuy . com by reitterating this line of action wil proceed as of 0 . 00am tommorow 00th of march if the situation is unresolved by 0 . 00pm today .
negative	they have had ample time and had my money for far too long !!
negative	!
negative	will keep all you other disgruntled viewers updated .
negative	latest update 00 . 00pm sunday 00th_march .
negative	received further email from conrad at cex wecare ??
negative	team today 00 / 00 /_0000 at 00 . 00
negative	quote :
negative	i apologise for the delay in getting back to you .
negative	the voucher refund has_been processed on the 00th of march back to payment_method and you should receive the same within 0 - 0 working_days .
negative	now i don_'_t know whether this is a direct result of me theatening legal_action ( appropriate complaint form was already filed with watford trading_standards 00th_march ) or the result of emails sent directly to persons i have been led to believe are directors of cex ( linkedin is a useful website ) whatever , one should not have to resort to such measures if a company wants to retain a loyal_customer base and for them to be successful , that requires a proffesionally run after care customer service dept .
negative	which is clearly non_existent in this case !
negative	let '_s see if my account is refunded in quote : 0 - 0 working_days from 00th of march .
negative	ttfn
negative	sorry its been so long for an update but have been unwell ( this case being a contributory factor )
negative	i finally received monies_owed on 00th of march but no proper explanation , appology or offer of recompense for all the inconvenience_caused !
negative	so you can safely say that i won_'_t be having any further dealings with ( we don_'_t care ) @ webuy . com
negative	buyers_beware , if you use this site as the initial service received when purchasing is pretty good but if you have a problem of any sort , its pretty damned ugly !
negative	!
negative	signing out for good .
negative	g . corlay
negative	bt have disconnected me after one week of using the internet from bt_infinity :/ and after apart of taking from by direct_debit 0000 gbp as cancelation charges , offered me reconnection after 0 weeeks !!!!
negative	but same time charing 00 gbp for installation of the line i already have !!!
negative	!
negative	i were calling bt trying to get help on their facebook profile but is already 00 days from my disconnection time and things aren_'_t moving inch forward .
negative	ordered 0 t shirts with my own logo came on reasonable time but !
negative	printing out of align sent them back , but due to lack of communication & with no one answering the phone i don_'_t know what the hell is going on .
negative	i have made several phone_calls different times of the day & all you get is a answer machine . i have sent several emails no reply its a complete_joke .
negative	this was going to be a large order ?
negative	ive been trying to move to scottish_power since march this year .
negative	they are now supplying electricity but not gas .
negative	they didnt_bother to tell me there was an issue , i only realised when i got a bill from previous_supplier edf !!
negative	!
negative	i '_ve spent hours trying to get this resolved and have been passed from pilar to post .
negative	now i am on worst tariff with edf , not benefitting from dual_fuel discount and i have just about lost the will to live .
negative	i '_ve been told its going to be another few weeks before this can be resolved .
negative	anyone know how i get compensation for excess costs_incurred due to their inefficiency .
negative	top tip_: avoid like the plague !!!!!
negative	i wish i had seen reviews before trying to move .
negative	never order from this company , you will not receive your goods .
negative	i ordered two t shirts on 00 . 00 . 0000 and have not received them at time of writing this review - 00 . 00 . 0000 .
negative	there is no telephone_number to speak to anybody and i have sent three emails asking where my goods are and no reply .
negative	i have sent a recorded delivery letter to their wakefield address asking for the goods or my monies reimbursed , but still no response .
negative	they only conned £_00 . 00 out of me but i am still pursuing them through trading_standards .
negative	annoyingly i failed to read the reviews on this website relating to argoth before ordering , but you live and learn !
negative	!
negative	this company should be taken off the net .
negative	they scammed me into paying twice then wouldnt deliver the item .
negative	then told me it would take 00 days for a refund . i was lucky i paid with vise dabit so my bank eventually got it back for me
negative	dont use this company they steal your money and dont send out the order
negative	sold item on ebay bough delivery with interpacel two_days late picking it up only going 000_miles down the road 00 days_later got email_saying item is lost no money back no help nothing
negative	stay_away i wouldn_'_t wish this company on my enemies !
negative	0_star is 0_stars too many
negative	took a laptop in for a simple screen repair - covered by the " whatever_happens " insurance .
negative	after arranging a pick_up twice with no attempt made to collect , or contact me about it , i took the laptop in to the local_store .
negative	they asked if i had backed everything up - i had - but they offered their special backup service in any case .
negative	0_weeks_later , the laptop was ready ( slow , but at_least fuss free ).
negative	on starting the laptop again , it had been wiped .
negative	this was just a screen repair .
negative	they did not need to touch the hard_drive or contents thereof .
negative	not only that , but the home page of the installed browsers has_been changed - with dsg ( dixons store group ) as the referrer ( this makes them money ).
negative	some shovelware had been installed - including the awful bullguard virus checker .
negative	this consistently comes last in group tests for anti_virus_software .
negative	i have now been working all morning to apply update to windows 0 - they managed to install their shovelware , but not update the system .
negative	it was in perfect working order before i brought it to them and , 0 hours in , i am still applying updates and attempting to identify a networking issue that hasn_'_t ever troubled me before .
negative	i suspect it is something to do with the rubbish they install in order to earn more money for dsg and try to get unwitting users to part with more cash for one of their over priced " services " from the clueless " tech guys ".
negative	avoid this company .
negative	they are a plague .
negative	i am sorry to say but the vice is not very well made when not locked it wobbles all over the place and there is no datum line for the degree scale so is pointless to have the scale .
negative	something else to sit unused on back of the bench .
negative	all in all not happy with it
negative	i thought that everything was uk stock and would take delivery next_day . seems they not uk_based and order confirmation 00_hours after_placing order and 0 to 0 day after that for delivery , not good if your looking to replace bits and practice mid week .
negative	heavy_duty chain splitter failed to split standard 000 chain so very iffy quality as was the fly shorts with waistband that comes off in you hand .
negative	sent package back but don_'_t have any idea when i will get replacement .
negative	shall be supporting my local shop in future .
negative	no delivery package and no reply to e . mails sended .
negative	even when paying with card did they require proof as gas bill to shipp .
negative	system on the market to check via the bank at check out .
negative	i canceled it , as i needed it at a specific date .
negative	not acceptable
negative	i purchased a plant from you to be sent to south_africa instead of flowers for a funeral last_week and i have just received a notice that nothing has arrived .
negative	so where is the order as i am not going to pay for something that has not been delivered .
negative	i await your urgent reply .
negative	my order number was 00000000
negative	the fall of icuk
negative	having been with icuk for several_years we ’ ve experienced first - hand the gradual degradation of the quality of service and network performance of this isp .
negative	once a shining_example of a british broadband_provider who worked hard to stand out from the big_players by providing a premium but reliable internet service , icuk is now nothing more than an overpriced minnow .
negative	the service
negative	firstly , icuk are a bt reseller .
negative	as a result , they cannot ( or at_least have been incompetent in doing so ) quickly and responsively regulate the amount of bandwidth available to their subscription base .
negative	as the slow_speeds in certain_areas and cripplingly frequent packet loss demonstrate , the small company don_’_t possess enough clout to force bt ’_s hand to increase their bandwidth when they need it most .
negative	prime examples of this include major sporting_events .
negative	during the olympics , for example , we could barely load webpages for a fortnight whilst icuk support staff complained that bt hadn_’_t yet processed their request for more bandwidth ( the request being two_weeks outstanding by that stage ).
negative	this leaves you and i , the paying customers , with high pings , packet loss exceeding 00_% and sore fingers from typing so many frustrated emails to their support staff over the weekend .
negative	telephone support is only available on weekdays and ends at 00 : 00 .
negative	you probably_won_’_t be surprised to learn that most issues occur outside of working hours when the majority of people are actually using their internet after coming home from a hard day ’_s work .
negative	even on icuk ’_s more_expensive ‘ business ’ package ( as we were ) the worst times for congestion were evenings and weekends ; not standard ‘ business ’ hours – don_’_t fall for this scam like we did .
negative	when you find you can only download at 000kb / s ( likely due to network congestion from the aforementioned lack of bandwidth for the entire icuk network or as a result of traffic shaping implemented to compensate the lack of bandwidth ), your only means of resolution is to fire off an email to their support_team which will go_unanswered until the following_day .
negative	by this time , tests and assessments of your service will be performed outside of peak hours and an email will follow asking for you to provide more information as they ‘ cannot see a problem from their end ’.
negative	the support
negative	that last line will probably be one of the most common phrases you will hear from icuk .
negative	during the olympics fiasco mentioned_above ( one of many , i must add ) icuk went to the extent of sending an engineer to our house to check the bt lines ( all which were of perfect working order ) before finally letting slip that it might have been their chronically oversubscribed infrastructure that was causing the problem .
negative	this was quietly admitted to us in what was probably the 00th email exchange between us and four different members of their support_team ( most of whom are very friendly and genuinely seem to want to help , it must be said ).
negative	after that point we were implicitly invited to leave icuk by their staff and it was implied that the problems we suffered as a result of the oversubscription would be a regular_occurrence .
negative	this was indeed the case .
negative	why icuk ?
negative	( why indeed !?)
negative	one therefore has to consider what the advantages of icuk are over other resellers and isps .
negative	the ( limited ) uk service support is arguably better_than many of the biggest isps and the staff are for the large part friendly and with good intentions .
negative	we had only one truly poor engineer assist us and he was removed from our support case after a week of failing to progress matters ( not that this ultimately expedited a resolution ).
negative	that said , having better customer_support than the likes of bt is far from high praise and many other smaller uk isps offer similar or better support to their customers ( including during the hours you will actually be using the internet if you ’ re in gainful employment ).
negative	in terms of pricing , we found icuk to be slightly more_expensive than other similarly sized isps due to their tiered bandwidth pricing .
negative	this is alleviated somewhat if you choose to bundle line rental with them ( as we did – not recommended as it ’_s more inconvenient / expensive to ultimately leave ).
negative	as discussed , the quality of the internet service was frequently extremely poor and we had consistent problems throughout our time with icuk , none of which were identified as issues with our hardware or anything our end .
negative	the premium pricing therefore no_longer translates to a better quality of service , unlike it did at the time when we first joined all those years_ago .
negative	if you don_’_t use the internet for anything more than web browsing then one of the cheaper packages would perhaps be suited for you .
negative	if , however , you or any member of your family enjoys online gaming , streaming online television services ( netflix , etc_.)
negative	or hasn_’_t a substantial_amount of free time to endlessly chase their support staff , then icuk is definitely not for you .
negative	our_household have since changed to a similar small uk isp and could not be_happier with the quality of service we ’ ve received .
negative	given the countless hours of frustration and time we ’ ve wasted with icuk i can only make one good faith recommendation to other consumers : avoid .
negative	don_'_t do it sell you dvds and cds and use the money to buy a decent kit from a reputable store .
negative	music_magpie customer service , project_manager refused to even talk personally to me on the phone about the quality of their suppliers kits .
negative	direct teamwear supply the kit second rate , in my opinion faulty all kits supplied were seconds tried to buy me off with a few footballs and bibs , should have know better really , they say you get what you pay for , however average the price they pay you for a dvd cd we could have bought a decent quality kit for the money we would have raised .
negative	avoid like the plague use someone like [_link ], you get a better price and use the money raised to buy a kit from somewhere like pro direct soccer or clubline football .
negative	if you could have minus stars then i certainly would have my experience was so bad .
negative	and so this dispicable saga goes on .
negative	last_week as the response from world_stores indicates i received an apologetic voice_mail , asking me to ring them to discuss , as they recognise that there has_been errors and mistakes that were unacceptable with my order and that they have now upgraded me for a saturday delivery .
negative	what they forgot to say was it doesn_'_t matter_how many_times you ring the number ( in my case 00 times to date ) they will not answer .
negative	what they also failed to do was obviously advise the couriers that they are to deliver saturday , because they turned_up yesterday morning and duly awoke our neighbour who works nights to take the delivery in for me , which did not go down well at all .
negative	then , to my total disbelief , i find that both the tables that they have delivered are damaged .
negative	world_stores , even you could not make this any worse if you tried !!
negative	!
negative	of course i rang their contact number and guess_what , no one could assist me and i would need to call the complaints_dept on the number that no one answers .
negative	i will not however , relent until i have a satisfactory_conclusion to this total farce .
negative	but then , i will never return to world_stores and advise anyone_else to seriously think_twice .
negative	they don_'_t even do the words incompetent , disorganised , chaos or unreliable justice "...................
negative	ordered coffee_table and occasional table .
negative	coffee_table arrived prompt with order update saying other table will be delayed by supplier .
negative	had to wait on calls for nearly an_hour to get update and emailed re the same .
negative	received email_stating order coming 0st oct .
negative	waited in all day for the 0nd time to then receive a call saying problem with table .
negative	shouldn_'_t have been allowed to order one because they come in pairs .
negative	would like like to double my cost ??
negative	no .
negative	agreed their mistake and they accepted and promised to deliver friday 0th_october .
negative	it '_s now 0 . 00pm and stayed in a third day and nothing here as yet .
negative	rang them up and currently still holding on after 0hr and 00_minutes
negative	by far the worst organization i have dealt_with .
negative	never known such a poor delivery service by on line traders
negative	argos have lost plot on customer service .
negative	ordered bbq form ebay may .
negative	got a call a little later to say first available delivery 00 june .
negative	not ideal , but said ok . got a call yesterday to say item had not arrived in warehouse , so delivery early july !
negative	why_advertise what you do not have ?
negative	queried what was included with item , told don_'_t know see manufactures web_site .
negative	what is sold by manufacturer includes cover and gas regulator .
negative	why don_'_t they say !
negative	bought dyson handheld_vacuum from local_store yesterday .
negative	offer included free accessory_kit .
negative	not available at time of purchase .
negative	told to look online to see when available .
negative	then reserve on line , and make additional trip to pick_up at own_expense !
negative	why not take customer details , and offer to post free of charge ?
negative	luckily i don_'_t run my business in the same way , otherwise i wouldn_'_t even have a shirt on my back !!
negative	!
negative	had to remove my review after [_name removed_] ( well , that '_s the western name he went by then ) deliberately withheld my money and required me to remove it before refunding me .
negative	i then didn_'_t bother to redo the review , although i kept the e_- mails to remind me to beware futeko in the future .
negative	however , i '_ve been prompted to review again as i see he is still getting up the same tricks with other customers despite me being ' the only unsatisfied customer he ' d ever had ' .
negative	shame as there are probably a few good entrepreneurs around but this experience has made me think_twice and i tend to get better value and less hassle sticking to the bigger_players now .
negative	ebay feedback means nothing , you realise that you can cheat the ebay system through low price purchases etc to artificially alter your score and dissatisfied_customers receiving forced paypal refunds can '_t leave_feedback once the transaction is nullified so of course there '_s less negative_feedback for him on there .
negative	at_least i know my poor experience wasn_'_t isolated , although i do feel for anyone unlucky_enough to have suffered at the hands of futeko '_s petulant customer service .
negative	i understand that [_name removed_] has immediately requested the review be pulled due to missing proof of purchase ( so much for someone that doesn_'_t even like trustpilot .
negative	i '_ll save the review text and email my receipt to trustpilot if that helps ?
negative	thanks
negative	[_name removed_],
negative	i '_ve sent them my paypal receipt and also the nice email you sent where you told me you ' d only refund me if i removed the trustpilot review .
negative	thanks
negative	updated again following comments !
negative	' we have no idea who this person is '!
negative	!
negative	i didn_'_t wait_until now , you made me remove my original review as you blackmailed me in order to receive my refund !
negative	i didn_'_t repost it immediately as you asked i give you the benefit of the doubt .
negative	i did .
negative	you failed to improve !
negative	your comments here demonstrate it , and i find it an interesting diversion to observe how your responses and claimed the world it out to get you and how good you are on other forums etc ( i googled you and these reviews on trustpilot are actually your best ones !)
negative	:) .
negative	until you realise you simply can '_t be as you are and provide poor and in some cases possibly even criminal service such as blackmailing to withhold refund without just cause , then you '_ll probably still get the ' few ' reviewers who don_'_t want others to suffer as they have !
negative	well top be fair [_name removed_], i did have to send trustpilot full evidence via all of the nasty emails and bribes as evidence before they would even host the review , and as you recall , it was you who blackmailed me to remove my original review otherwise you ' d still be withholding my refund now , in contradiction of the uk '_s distance_selling_regulations !
negative	whilst i wish all entrepreneurs the best in their endeavors , your denial and claims of false reviews are an indication that you continue to trade as you did when i purchased from you , with bullying_tactics and false_claims that poor reviews are biased and from non - customers .
negative	i guess from your continued attitude as i bought from you in 0000 and you are still doing the same thing now to customers you '_ll never really change to being a fair person to deal with , but i do give credit where credit '_s due , and am_glad i kept a folder with all of your wonderful email responses in it after all !
negative	i '_m as surprised as the next person to find that trustpilot is actually impossible to leave a false negative_review in as the business owner has total veto unless evidence can be provided , hence_why the false positive from the original reviewer was retained !
negative	and ebay % aren_'_t representative as you can ransom people for feedback .
negative	your ebay business and futeko are 0 separate entities .
negative	at_least we agree on 0 thing , dpd are a good delivery service and yodel are pretty poor in general !
negative	all the best !
negative	updated .
negative	bertie , ta for your comment .
negative	ive given flubit a try .
negative	success !
negative	you made an offer , i bought it .
negative	you then delivered a different item to the one i ordered !
negative	whats this ?
negative	the websire is now down for 0 days ?
negative	so i cant arrange to retrun it and by the time i return from holidays im_sure itll be fun arguing with your staff under the sale of goods_act for a refund !
negative	great experience so_far !
negative	sadly a pretty_useless company .
negative	whenever they can '_t get a better deal ( about 00 +% of the time , so either i '_m bargain_hunter of the century or they ' re not very good and rely solely on purchase power discounts !)
negative	they say it '_s prohibited .
negative	i . e payg phones .
negative	they can certainly source them from amazon , as i have had the phone ' offered ' when i found it at amazon .
negative	however , direct from 0 for instance , and it '_s ' ooooh that '_s prohibited '.
negative	incidentally , they don_'_t have a telephone service , do not let the published number deceive you in to thinking they will answer the phone , it '_s a droll little automated selection followed_by the phone ringing out , there '_s no one there .
negative	more trouble than it '_s worth , had more value for money using topcashback and less time wasted too .
negative	called jl and they advised me store had stock and would price match ( never_knowingly undersold my ar $ e !
negative	).
negative	walked to store to be faced with clueless ' we don_'_t stock that ' response .
negative	useless and poor internal comms !
negative	very dissapointed with experience , purchased from a different retailer in the end .
negative	i have never_experienced such miserable customer service from a company in my life .
negative	problems started the moment i opened my account and have persisted throughout .
negative	they set the date of my dd for the end of the month , 00th , which i immedeiately advised was unsuitable and requested that they change to the begining of the month so i could guarantee funds would be available .
negative	they advised this was impossible and switched me to paying by cheque ( same date ) instead .
negative	i advised that this was also unsuitable as : i don_'_t have a cheque book , i ' d have the extra hassle of posting out the cheque and the date was still unsuitable .
negative	they wouldn_'_t budge so i was forced back into paying the dd on the date i didn_'_t want .
negative	in july they mysteriously stopped taking my dds , unfortunately i did not notice for a few_months but having presumed they would have spent the money in my account .
negative	when i did realise and contacted them i was advised they would take it the following month .
negative	this has_been going on for 0 months now and despite make wasting many hours emailing them and calling them they are now threatening me with legal_action as they have allowed the amount to increase to over £_000 !
negative	they admitted to me in email and over the phone that they have had issues with their direct_debits and that none of this is my fault .
negative	i arranged a payment plan with one of their managers - also securing a discount of £_00 and a refund of £ 0 for them trying to take the full_amount on the 00th of november when the funds weren_'_t available and very surprising as they ' d insisted numerous_times that they could only take dds on the 00th of the month .
negative	despite me making this arrangement they have continued to mail and text me requesting the full_amount and have now threatened court_action to retrieve the money and have outlined the extra_charges i can expect to pay should this go to court .
negative	on receipt of this letter i immediately called them and advised of the plan agreed with the manager and requested i speak to a manager .
negative	no one was available and i was told i ' d be called back within 00_hours .
negative	the call never came , i called them back to find they ' re closed on saturdays , so i mailed them again and i am awaiting a reply .
negative	they are without_any doubt the most disorganised and inept company i have ever_dealt_with and i would strongly_advise anyone looking to switch to them not to , i cannot think of any positive thing to say about them other than the one member of staff who did try and help me : chris mcateer - though his_efforts seem to have been screwed_up by them anyway .
negative	i '_m off to waste another £_00 calling them and hope i can resolve this before i take them to court for the stress they are causing .
negative	edit_: still on hold 00mins
negative	avoid , avoid , avoid !!!!!!!!!!!!!
negative	!
negative	after telling_me that my prescription was out of date and not giving me time to get a new one , they charged me £ 0 . 00 admin_fees and £ 0 . 00 bank charges .
negative	thieves !
negative	avoid at all costs .
negative	still_waiting for it to turn_up so not so happy
negative	i '_ve been waiting now over 0_weeks for a product that i asked for next_day delivery ......
negative	really uphappy with menkind , found the perfect gift for a present , ordered and paid for the item with next_day delivery but despite having charged me they apparently sent it standard delivery which is quoted as 0 - 0 working_days ... 0_weeks_later i still have not received anything and when i called i was told they would not even speak to me about it until it had been missing for 00 working_days ( basically 0_weeks ) and then only if i speak to my local sorting_office first to get them to look for it incase they have missplaced it ...
negative	this is a total_joke and basically i feel robbed , i have no idea when or if i will receive the goods , they have however refunded the express delivery fee .. wooopdy doo .
negative	i moved to an empty flat in london in august , and must have spent in excess of gbp 0 , 000 since then at tesco , both online as well in the nearest_store .
negative	i am not used to order grocery online and was admittedly a bit_skeptical at my first delivery , that never arrived .
negative	after phoning tesco they initially told me it was my fault for not being at home , but they discovered that although my address was right in the system the print for the driver somehow cut_off the last digit in my flat no so they delivered to the wrong flat .
negative	tesco assured this would be corrected , but due to shortage of people they could no_longer deliver that day .
negative	0nd , 0rd and 0th time the same happened except the portner saw my name and knew it was wrong so they got here anyway .
negative	today we have a new portner here and the same thing happened , the grocery newer reached me .
negative	well after a identical conversation as the first time , tesco realized that they did not correct the mistake , and assured me from the call_center in scotland that they would deliver this same day .
negative	well after having heard_nothing for two hours i called again and was told they have staff shortage ( where have i heard that before ) and could not deliver .
negative	now i had it , i will now give sainsbury a chance and suggest everybody_else does the same .
negative	envirofone is the worst company i have ever had dealings with .
negative	the quoted a price but reduced it by 00_% when they had my phone .
negative	envirofone refused to return my phone and i lost £_00 on their 0000 customer service number trying to sort it out .
negative	do not use company , they are dishonest .
negative	phoned 0 days before installing for advice received no reply
negative	quality of product was bad adhesive stuck over leds , paid a lot of money for product and acessories the joiners did not work
negative	as an electrician i would not use your company again , i had to
negative	explain to my customer why it cost so much to install
negative	after promising cheaper monthly_payments they informed me that my monthly dd was increasing from £_00 to £_00 , more than my previous_supplier .
negative	this was based on my " expected " use over the next year .
negative	no calculations were shown , however , so i rang and challenged this .
negative	the operator told me that in fact my usage showed i ' d need to pay £_00 per_month , so he changed the dd record at their end to this amount .
negative	literally , the very next month they increased it to £_00 !
negative	they didn_'_t reply to emails , i couldn_'_t get through the queuing system on the phone so i went back through uswitch to select a different supplier .
negative	seems the best way to go .
negative	not even fully with first_utility yet but after a week of trying to contact them im heading back to my previous_supplier .
negative	sent an email to them on monday , got a automated_reply and heard_nothing since .
negative	tried to call on monday with no joy .
negative	tried again today and again no joy .
negative	read the reviews on this site and low and behold they answered first time when i said i wanted to join .
negative	i then got transfered both_times and cut_off .
negative	customer service is obviously low on their company values .
negative	ta ta
negative	recieved e_mail_confirming payment sent on monday 00th_april still_waiting .
negative	this review arrived before my money .
negative	i have had an issue with a review written about our company that is not true and slanderous .
negative	i have sent evidence to trust_pilot and there answer was we dont care as long as they have bought something off you .
negative	totally immoral website that has no care for others .
negative	review centre took my proof that i showed and took the review off , trust_pilot don_'_t give a damn .
negative	i like when you post a review :
negative	" we '_ll publish your review soon and you '_ll see it on trustpilot '_s profile .
negative	your honest_opinion makes a difference .
negative	thanks again for sharing ."
negative	hopefully trust_pilot can find what " honest " means .
negative	i should also add that on receiving our review we got a phone_call from trust_pilot employee explaining about the review and then tried to sell business packages .
negative	gives you an idea of what they are like as a company .
negative	so they promise you a " dedicated account_manager ", and yet that person doesn_'_t exist as far as i can tell .
negative	they offer you a " guaranteed fitting slot ", and then can '_t get the tyres delivered to the fitting_station in time ( despite having two_days to get them there ).
negative	and when they finally admit at 0 :_00pm the day before you are meant to have them fitted that they have screwed_up , all they do is just send you your money back and don_'_t even apologise .
negative	not even once .
negative	and to think you pay £_00 more per_tyre ( so nearly_£_000 more for a set ) than getting them shipped from oponeo . co . uk and paying your local_fitter direct , because they are a " premium " service that is hassle_free .
negative	steer_clear .
negative	totally_useless , and highly arrogant when things go_wrong .
negative	not a credible review site for business or consumer .
negative	a huge list of consumer complaint comments about wae removed yet again .
negative	contact trustpilot ?
negative	i think not .
negative	wish i ' d looked here and read their ridiculous terms and conditions before ordering .
negative	scam company that takes payment for goods they do not posses .
negative	ordered on 00 / 00 / 00 , paid extra for special delivery and payment taken immediately .
negative	00mins on hold to speak to somebody .
negative	they offered store credit for the delivery charge , refused to give even an estimated delivery time .
negative	cancel order was agreed - but quickly pointed_out this would be 00 days .
negative	still no refund - customer_services will be happy to talk over you and quote ridiculous terms .
negative	waiting for the 00 days before issuing proceedings against them .
negative	still no fefund .
negative	note all the recent negative_reviews have been reported and removed
negative	time running out , no refund and i notice the increase in shill reviews
negative	first of all trouble started when i brought a muti gym from uk sport_imports , parts were damaged , sent me extra parts that i did not require and the parts i had did not fit correctly .
negative	took me awhile but after many phone_call where you are waiting for someone to answer the phone after 00mins it got sorted .
negative	then i thought i '_ll give them another chance and order a cross_trainer .
negative	the item came guess_what 0 parts faulty no surprise there then .
negative	rang back had to wait 00mins + for someone to answer .
negative	got new parts then the fly wheel would not work , rang back again told me to take it apart , not able to open the whole_thing could not see what went wrong .
negative	in the end after another call asked for my money back , i have learnt never to use this company again i have purchased many items from other_companies and had had not problems .
negative	pay alittle extra - dont use uk sport import .
negative	they advertised that it would take two_days to process an order , and three or four days to deliver .
negative	they took my money in seconds , but nearly a week_later they were still " processing " the order .
negative	when i first tried to cancel , they begged me not to saying they would be able to send my " camera " within a week .
negative	i was not reassured - i had ordered a mobile_phone .
negative	i cancelled .
negative	it has taken seven weeks to get a refund from them during which time i have sent innumerable e_- mails , telephoned and hand to stand the interest charges on my credit_card .
negative	avoid them .
negative	buy somewhere_else .
negative	dreadful call_centre wait times - held on for 00_minutes today ( after the initial message said wait times were around 00 min ).
negative	when i got through was advised i need to call again tomorrow to get a mac_code or for alternative broadband deals .
negative	i bought two things online both from croydon .
negative	both said dispatched emails one arrived promptly the other i waited the 0 days and then mailed .
negative	no response - mailed again the next_day copying in info_@ - again no response .
negative	raised a complaint with paypal asking again polity where it was - no apology just a tracking_number : it was sent on the day i fist asked where it was - obviously that had prompted them into sending it .
negative	why couldn_'_t they just sent a email_saying sorry - its in the post now ?
negative	another complaint - sent a email to feedback @ and also got no response - obviously a arrogant company that think they are doing us a favor by allowing us to buy from them .
negative	purchased a new battery for my makita from yourselves and found when plugged in the charger flashed saying the battery was no good so believing it can not be the battery as it is brand_new i bought anew battery_charger still no good so then i tried your battery in a friends charger still no good .
negative	so now have no battery as it has_been returned to yourselves and i have 0 battery chargers so a very costly experience
negative	when returning a faulty phone which was just three_months old i was informed it would have to be returned to the manufacturer which would take some time .
negative	the manager in the store really could do with some customer_care training , he suggested i borrowed a neighbours phone whilst it was away .
negative	i bought a premium product for reliability and found both the product and the supplier really not at the standard they should be for a national retailer .
negative	think of your customers and your customer_care ratings there '_s a lot of upset people who have purchased from you and been let_down .
negative	no shipping or delivery instructions taken with order with the result that delivery was attempted but failed .
negative	take instructions up front for delivery dates and what to do if no answer for leaving the parcel .
negative	don_'_t force customers to chase for delivery of an item they have bought .
negative	five times the effort to chase delivery as to make the purchase - massive waste of my time and effort !!
negative	!
negative	god_awful service from dabs
negative	god help anyone who_uses this company .
negative	il begin with the web_site stating my solid_state drive would be in stock in 0 - 0 days , 0 days_later i got bored of waiting and removed this order since it was a compleate load of rubish that it will be arriving within 0 days
negative	so ...... my order gets shipped , and some arrives , not everything is there though , infact a graphics_card i payed 000 £ for which has_been taken from my account , isnt in the delivery , even_though its in the delivery note , i email them and im re - embursed , i take a look at there site and see the graphics_card ...... whilst iv been waiting for the ssd to come in has_gone off offer , so even_though i payed for the item while it was on offer it was taken from my delivery , and then it was me who had to chase them for re - embursment
negative	so then my chasis arrives , the pacaging is perfect , the styrofone is perfect and holds its so well it takes 0 grown men to get the chassis out of the box , soooo .... how has the internal parts of the chasis been shattered , its because its a b - grade product , iv been charged for a full product .
negative	and im still_waiting for this issue to be resolved even after 0 emails , and over a month .
negative	now after 0 days shy of a whole month waiting for my monitor it has arrived , soaking_wet and damaged
negative	out of intrest i sent them an email letting them know i wanted to send my soaking_wet monitor back on friday_morning ( 0nd sept ), and still no response , they will want to courier it back which will take 0 days to arange and a day to take place , at best .
negative	my job takes me away from my hometown and although im not strugling for money i would have been looking at taking a new contract last_week , yet im still stuck here with no answers , not even replys to my emails
negative	i spent an_hour on the phone they never even picked_up , what a joke , no reply to my emails
negative	nothing .....
negative	all i want is to be able to return the faulty goods iv been delivered , and i should at_least get back half the cash for the chasis
negative	thankyou for reading this post , any help or advice would be greatly appreicated , since at the moment im realy restraining myself from emailing them telling them im going to take them to court
negative	kind rigards
negative	phil
negative	took my bike in for a service at the milton_keynes branch .
negative	i asked for a full service , approx_£_00 .
negative	thought it funny when i was only charged £_00 , thinking i ' d been given a deal .
negative	it wasn_'_t until i rode the bike that weekend that i discovered that the gears had been poorly adjusted , the gears , chain and rear_mech hadn_'_t been lubricated .
negative	worse of all the headset was loose so when i pushed down on the handlebars they rotated .
negative	this is blatant and dangerous incompetence !
negative	i was given contact details for my company '_s ' cycle to work ' rep at halfords .
negative	i emailed her my greviances and got diddly - squat response , not even an_apology .
negative	00 / 00 /_0000 i received a delivery from amazon uk ( don_'_t know from which warehouse ).
negative	the delivery was left_outside my back door and a calling_card posted throught the front_door letter_box .
negative	exact time is unknown as the card is incomplete .
negative	the problem is that for the driver to have left the package by the back door , he would have to have walk down the access drive to the left of my property , trespassed across my neighbours property and then thrown !!!!!!!!
negative	the package over my wall for the it to land by my back door .
negative	this is a good 00metres .
negative	this is totally_unacceptable behaviour and i will not tolerate it happening again .
negative	this was not the first time i '_ve had stuff thrown over my wall by their drivers .
negative	after making an order online i rang to make a small change ( tariff ) to my pre_- order for a sony_xperia z , the rep i spoke to said they couldnt amend my order , all they could do was cancel and resubmit it but i was more concerned to hear my application had not been accepted and i had not been contacted despite having made this order 00 days earlier !
negative	i assumed this was an_oversight as the person mentioned there was only one t in my name on the bank details so i went back online to resubmit the application .
negative	i rang back to check if this went through ok only to be told i had been declined by o0 , no explanation was offered as to why .
negative	i therefore rang o0 ( as im an existing customer ) only for them to tell me as an existing client i would be an " automatic accept " and they had no record of my application from their end !
negative	rang back carphone_warehouse to explain the above , no satisfactory_explanation just told me i had been declined due to adverse credit , this is utter nonsense as i have since seen my equifax credit_report which has no marks or blemishes and scores me as " excellent ", the only offer your staff made was to try another network .
negative	i am totally confused as to why i have actually been declined by cpw / o0 and quite_frankly am discusted with the service i have received from them .
negative	since i have seen my credit_report ( and its fine ) i have asked them to tell me specifically why my application has_been declined , surprisingly they couldnt tell me .
negative	i have since ordered my experian report which already shows my search by orange ( which i arranged through dial a phone ) which was several days after trying cpw but surprisingly no searches showing for cpw / o0 which suggests a credit search was never even carried_out .
negative	it all stinks of misinformation and im none the wiser
negative	---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
negative	edit_: 00 / 00 / 00 - well its 0 working_days on and no comment from cpw - bad_publicity on trustpilot is one thing but we '_ll see what watchdog have to say about it if cpw cant be_bothered to respond on here .
negative	i arrived at the woking store 0 minutes before closing but an employee watched me walk to the door and then locked it .
negative	this is just rude and bad customer service .
negative	at the very least he should say sorry we are closing .
negative	i used stress_free parking at heathrow .
negative	my car was returned with a large stain ( still wet ) on the passenger_seat .
negative	my tax_disk had gone_missing and about £ 0 had been stolen from my money tray .
negative	absolutely nothing has_been done about any of this after 0 emails and 0 phone_calls .
negative	although accepting liability on the day , they have since refused to accept_responsibility .
negative	i purchased 0 tablets and a laptop from them .
negative	the tablets were ok but the laptop i wanted and ordered was suddenly out of stock .
negative	they never advised me it was only because i contacted them that i found out .
negative	they offered me another ( more_expensive ) laptop which i paid the extra .
negative	the main requirement was it had to be small and lightweight .
negative	the laptop that arrived must have been an old one which was extremely large and heavy .
negative	not what i wanted .
negative	when i phoned to complain to see if i could change for a lighter laptop ( even to pay the extra again ), they refused even_though the only reason i purchased the laptop as it was recommended by them .
negative	do not trust this company .
negative	multiple_locations in the s . w and midlands but all had sales staff that did not care one hoot for potential_buyers .
negative	drove 000_miles to test_drive a car in solihull - they forgot i was coming .
negative	eventually got 0 mins in the car and decided to take it further .
negative	could not give me p / x on the day but , fine .
negative	eventually called me back 0 days_later - when i said the price offered it was a bit low , never_heard back .
negative	their loss - bought car for 00_% more than i was going for with them 0 days_later from an smaller jag franchise .
negative	we feel that we have been let_down very badly by this company !
negative	their customer_services are a total_shambles , they either ignore you or just don_'_t answer any of your comments .
negative	they havent answered an email for over a month !
negative	we have been trying to obtain a refund for an item we purchased , we have been fed a saga of lies , changing information and today when it was promised the goods woould be returned to us " repaired " they have failed to deliver them .
negative	this company is excellent if you don_'_t have a problem but any issue with the product they make life very very difficult ...
negative	in future we will be more concerned_about customer service than just the lowest_price ...
negative	avoid , avoid , avoid and then some .
negative	hong_kong site masquerading as legitimate british site , or at_least one that ships from within the eu .
negative	got stung on import_taxes for a quarter of the price of the original camera , meaning i would have been better off buying in the uk .
negative	warranty returns will obviously be a joke .
negative	contacted them regarding the charge and they gave a a ' bog off - it '_s in our t &_c ' reply .
negative	they need to make the facts that they ' re hong_kong based and that you '_ll be hit with considerable taxes much more obvious on their site .
negative	con merchants .
negative	i ordered the brave blu_ray for my daughter '_s birthday ( which was yesterday ).
negative	it has not arrived despite my having ordered it nearly 0_weeks_ago .
negative	i phoned the number on the bottom of the despatch email , but it was a wrong number ( putting me through to micronet or something ).
negative	i phoned the number on the website and it cut me off after saying they had a high_volume of calls ( unsurprising ).
negative	this is appalling .
negative	despite me having placed an order in ample time , my daughter is without the present she so wanted on her_birthday and the zavvi customer service team is uncontactable .
negative	i now have to got out and buy the film from a local_supermarket to prevent my daughter '_s upset .
negative	shocking customer service .
negative	tried to return an item with missing parts .
negative	manager looked at me like i ' d crawled out of a bin and said " how do i know you just haven_'_t taken the stuff out yourself ."
negative	refused to offer replacement and went on to patronise my wife .
negative	contacted complaints_department who just weren_'_t interested at all .
negative	never using them again .
negative	don_'_t need to spend my money in a shop to be accused of theft .
negative	i '_ve_used play for years , having spent a fair portion of my sweeties money with them .
negative	they ' re usually quite efficient in getting stuff to you ( though i did have some christmas orders turn_up well into th new year ) and competitively_priced .
negative	the problems come when you have a problem with an order .
negative	i returned an item and chose the option to cover the return postage myself .
negative	i was thus surprised when they deducted the postage from my refund .
negative	on contacting cs about this i was required to fax through proof of posting !
negative	they ' d acknowledge_receipt of the item , they had made the mistake , but required me to prove i ' d posted the item ?!
negative	i was unable to give this as i ' d used stamps and popped the item in a postbox ( it was only a cable ).
negative	suffice to say i won_'_t be using them again - too many competitors offering excellent customer service .
negative	these arrived and my partner found one side of the arrangement was all snapped and damaged .
negative	there were several lillies lying at the bottom of the box .
negative	it would appear that these have not been handled with care during delivery and have arrived in a poor state .
negative	i will not be using this company again .
negative	couldn_'_t go to a kings of leon concert so sent the tickets next_day delivery ( costing_£ 0 . 00 ) to viagogo tickets were priced well below face value to recoup some of my loss .
negative	no e_- mail_confirming_receipt , no e_- mail_stating any_problems , no listing !
negative	phoned a very unhelpful customer service person_who was unaware of the fact viagogo only state they need the tickets at_least 00_hours before the event .
negative	stated that he ' d escalate the call and i ' d receive a call back .
negative	call never happened , tickets didn_'_t sell and no option to pick them back up .
negative	someone from viagogo has probably had a great night out at my expense .
negative	stay well away from these *********** ( lots of expletives )
negative	******************************* update ****************************
negative	what a surprise two_days_later .
negative	still no contact from viagogo .
negative	tried to contact via their facebook_page - no response .
negative	this is such an unprofessional setup .
negative	wouldn_'_t recommend using these under any circumstances .
negative	******************** update 0 *****************************
negative	received voice_mail offering £_00 viagogo voucher ... £_00 less_than i was selling ticket for but at_least they ' re trying .....
negative	will update with developments .
negative	off we went boarded ship lovely room , had a drink retired to bed , noise from next door cabin ( party all night long ) never slept at all , next_day reported the noise to customer_services .
negative	the customer service did not act as we had another terrible return_journey on the return crossing , since returning home i have complained to d f d s no reply up to now thank_you d f d s tom duffy .
negative	we ordered a 0ft wide mattress , delivery was as arranged but when dropped_off men did not hang_around long enough for us to check it .
negative	it turns_out that we had the wrong_size 0 ' 0 which is too_narrow .
negative	we phoned customer_services who insisted we got what we ordered , they refusd to believe us when we told them we clicked on 0ft one , then said it was out fault because the size was not mentioned in confirmation_email it say '_s small single it does not mention exact size , if it did say 0 ' 0 we would have phoned to point out their mistake .
negative	they would only exchange mattresses if we paid a £_00 handling charge .
negative	we offered to meet them half way and pay £_00 but they refused .
negative	we have been advised by trading_standards that under the sale of goods_act_0000 we received an item that was not as_descibed , so we are entitled to a refund or exchange .
negative	as matressman have refused the exchange we have had to buy another mattress from another dealer so our disabled child has somewhere to sleep , so will now be insisting on a full_refund .
negative	as instructed by trading_standards we will be writing via_recorded delivery , stating our case .
negative	they are satisfied that the actual size is not mentioned in your email .
negative	and as mattressman customer_services said before we were put through to the assistant_manager and not the manger as requested , small single could be one of a few sizes .
negative	mattressman order : mm000000
negative	do not buy from these_people the bed i bought was delivered damaged but so called customer service came up with small_print to deny any responsibility .
negative	beware of these_people do not buy from them if you are thinking of buying a bed from them please think again and go somewhere_else . the bed i bought was £_000 . 00 it is now out for scrap .
negative	00 boxes ordered .
negative	they did not assemble well .
negative	poor design .
negative	0 out of 00 damaged and unuseable .
negative	first time i have used rajapack .
negative	very disappointing .
negative	i have been with vodafone over 0 years ... and not been happy with the bills , customer_services and generally the whole company !!
negative	!
negative	i had been over charged on each bill for no apparent_reason and took me over 0 years to get my money back for the over charge !!
negative	i had to go through my bills each_month an check properly .. just to see where they will charge me extra !
negative	not happy at all !
negative	if i could have left the stars blank i would have !
negative	( unless you can : p ).
negative	ive had a problem this morning with o0 top - up not crediting my wifes phone after the £_00 was taken from my account , the bank has confirmed this with a transaction_id .
negative	0 hours of phone_calls and im now waiting for a manager to call me back , but the way ive been dealt_with so_far im not expecting a call .
negative	the " customers service " advisors are the most incompetent patronising and unproffesional i have ever_dealt_with .
negative	i have a contract with o0 as well and have been for 00 years which will_definately stop at the and of the contract .
negative	phone service and reception is also very poor and mobile internet is poor at best , if i can get a signal .
negative	thought i would have a look to see what trustpilot was after_hearing about it from a colleague so i signed_up to take a look .
negative	within 00_hours i was bombarded with 0 phone_calls and emails from this company and felt_like i was getting the hard_sell .
negative	having taken a look at what they do it seems that they are after your community data for their own gain .
negative	i don_'_t trust trustpilot one bit .
negative	beware .
negative	think carefully before you do_business with this company .
negative	i bought a pair of expensive ray - ban prescription lens sunglasses .
negative	they arrived eventually ... so_far so good ...
negative	then a few_months later i broke one of the lenses .
negative	i contacted vd who offered to fix the lenses for a fee and it would take 0_weeks .. so_far so good .. that was back in june_0000 ..
negative	it is now late september and multiple stalling emails from vd reveal they have lost my glasses in hong_kong .
negative	okay these things_happen but it has taken them 0 months to admit it and now they don_'_t want to take_responsibility .
negative	my glasses cost over $_000 . 00 and i also paid around $_000 . 00 for the repair up front .
negative	so now i have no glasses and have paid for a repair .. every time vd contacts me it is someone_else .
negative	lesson_learned .
negative	when you can '_t physically walk into a store and complain you stand a chance in being treated_like dirt .
negative	all i want is my repair money refunded and my property back or my glasses replaced but am getting_nowhere .
negative	products are incorrectly listed on the website .
negative	when requesting a refund due to an inferior product being supplied , i was told that it was beyond the 0 day return period .
negative	i had emailed this company several_times to organize the return of the merchandise shortly_after i had received the wrong item , but received no reply to my emails .
negative	( the website states that they reply to emails in an_hour ).
negative	customer_services chatted some nonsense about product pictures not having to match product descriptions .
negative	this definitely is in contravention of the sale of goods_act_0000 .
negative	don_'_t buy from this company !
negative	avoid ........... avoid ............ avoid !
negative	0000 customer service prem rate no ,££ customer service operators work from asia very poor english
negative	00p a minute to land lines in the uk shocking
negative	i have been a customer for 00 years in the last 0 months the charges have gone_through the roof
negative	almost_impossible to speak to customer service via your mobile
negative	all automated now then it will cut you off
negative	" t " mobile offered me a deal yesterday when i asked for my pat code and told them i had enough and was leaving , 000 minutes 000 texts and a freephone upgrade .. ok i said .. today the phone arrived with a bill of £_00 . 00 receipted " paid " they have taken £_00 . 00 form my credit_card without authorisation enough !
negative	my advise to all avoid .. avoid ... avoid terrible service !
negative	misleading salesmen very expensive just awful
negative	i ordered a fridge from powerdirect .
negative	payment was taken at the time of order .
negative	however , 0 days_later i received an email_saying that the fridge i had ordered was no_longer being manufactured and would i like an_alternative .
negative	i then had to fill out a refund form to get the money back ( within " up to 00 days ") that they shouldn_'_t have taken in the first place .
negative	my follow_up email asking why they had taken payment blamed sagepay .
negative	i know how sagepay works , and the powerdirect representative was lying .
negative	i odered tyres online to match tyres already on my vehicle .
negative	they fitted a different tyre without mentioning that they didn_'_t have the tyre i ordered .
negative	they charged me for nitrogen fill in all 0 tyres which wasn_'_t requested or ordered .
negative	they also said tracking needed adjustment and charged me over £_00 for something they did in 0 minutes .
negative	the price of the tyres was the going rate but overall value still has to be poor .
negative	an email of complaint to ats hq only got a poor emailed response from ats penzance which didn_'_t tackle any of the points i had raised .
negative	ats doesn_'_t seem to be an honest company .
negative	i ordered over £_000 of printer_supplies on a 00 day service ( which i thought should give them plenty of time !).
negative	the goods didn_'_t arrive on day 00 , so i gave them a call and they said my order had been overlooked , but they had stock and they could send it .
negative	thinking all was now well , i looked forward to the imminent arrival of my order , but it '_s now 00 days since my order , no reply to phone message to chase , no reply to email chasing ( sent last_week ) and seemingly no nearer getting the product .
negative	i have instructed that the order is cancelled .
negative	i have now purchased elsewhere and got the products next_day .
negative	giffgaff looks good on paper , but as soon as something_goes_wrong , you may as well be on your own because their customer service is useless .
negative	it doesn_'_t matter what quetion you ask , they come_back with some kind of prepared stock answer that '_s inapproriate to what you asked .
negative	you can '_t phone up , you can only deal with them through an unreliable web based system .
negative	even sending a message to them results in a web error_message .
negative	their web system is bug ridden and has twice left me without being_able to use my phone because of one problem or another .
negative	i work in it and if the systems i developed were this poor , i ' d be sacked .
negative	it all feels_like it '_s held_together with string and cellotape .
negative	you can '_t even auto - renew your package ... you have to log on each_month and order it again .
negative	in short ... useless , unless you like spending ( at_least ) an_hour each_month trying to buy a " goody_bag ".
negative	first things first , parcel0go acts as a ' middle - man ' agent between the courier companies and the customer .
negative	because they give so much business to the courier companies , they get bulk discounts !
negative	unfortunately , parcel0go is giving honest couriers a bad name !
negative	i have used parcel0go on two occasions , first time the parcel collection failed , twice .
negative	hdnl were apparently instructed to collect on 00th_jan but the delivery driver had paperwork that suggested otherwise .
negative	second time i had a time - dependant package to send !
negative	the parcel was not collected so i cancelled the order only to find out that the 0 % surcharge on paypal payments is apparently non - refundable .
negative	they do not state anywhere that this surcharge is non - refundable - so after arguing with a belligerent customer_support agent ( who i later found out was a senior_manager and owner ...) for twenty_minutes and threatening various actions they finally agreed to refund my money i was rightfully owed !
negative	finally , their only form of contact is via_email or on - line chat .
negative	the on - line chat takes_forever to get connected to a person ( average 00_mins )!
negative	this company is run by a bunch of crooks and hopefully they will go out of business very soon and save a lot of people , a lot of hassle !
negative	ordered a product from nightgear and paid for 0 - 0 days delivery .
negative	after 0 days i contacted them to find out what had happened to my order , was told to get back in contact if the item had ' nt arrived within 00 days .
negative	so 00 days_later still no item , so got in contact .
negative	heard_nothing back as of yet so have emailed them again to see if i get a response .
negative	poor servcice and communication upto now , so i would ' nt recomend that you buy from this company .
negative	wouldn_'_t touch them with a bargepole .
negative	order placed on 0 / 0 with a 0 day delivery ; 00_hours_later update received to say item in their warehouse on 00 / 0 ; email today ( 00 / 0 ) saying item in warehouse on 00 / 0 - too late been on the slopes since 00 / 0 .
negative	had my money soon enough though !
negative	!
negative	totally_unreliable
negative	left fu three_months_ago , they still have not sent me a correct final_bill and insist on sending incorrect monthly_bills with bizarre readings .
negative	spent over 00_hours on the phone and countless_emails that just get ignored .
negative	i honestly wish i was never tempted by their cheap tariff .
negative	call queues are ridiculous , the longest time i have spent in a queue is 00_mins to which i was still cut_off .
negative	it also seems that their reps requeue you instead of taking the call , i worked in a call_centre years_ago and know the tricks .
negative	the average wait time is about 00_mins .
negative	clearly untrained customer service reps who seem to tell you something different every time you call .
negative	steer_well clear , it has a 0 . 0 score for a reason .
negative	further to last review , i have received an email from fu , the most unprofessional email i have ever received :
negative	dear_mr . wa * ker
negative	your enquiry
negative	thank_you for your email .
negative	i have checked the final_bill dated 00th_july_0000 .
negative	this is billing you for usage until the 0th of may when the account was closed with first_utility .
negative	please do come_back to me if you do not agree with this .
negative	as always we ' re here to help
negative	we have a wealth of information available online , please visit our help and advice pages to learn more and to manage your account .
negative	if you can '_t find what you are looking for , you can always contact us here .
negative	yours_sincerely
negative	amee
negative	first_utility : customer service
negative	wow , that mr w bit is exactly_what you are thinking it says .
negative	the most unprofessional company ever !!!!
negative	!
negative	this company is a farce , like others , if i could give - 0 i would .
negative	next_day delivery is a joke .
negative	was meant to be here 0 days ago so i rang earlier and asked what is going on , they said they had only just received it from supplier and they will deliver it tmw .
negative	however , i have just returned from work and they have apparently tried to deliver it today when i checked their website .
negative	there was no card as they obviously aint tried to deliver rather had it on the wagon , it got late so they returned to depot .
negative	so i rang again to try to arrange a new day , if i hadnt rang a saynoto0000 number i would have spent over five quid sitting in queues .
negative	a fiver to sit in a queue to try to arrange delivery and complain but yet you have to pay for it , how irate does this company want to make people , you pay for the pleasure of experiencing their ineptitude !!!
negative	just spoke to a poor member of their team in the call_centre who stated to me " let_me guess , you never got a calling_card !!!
negative	", she obviously knows_how poor the company is .
negative	i asked her does she get a lot of a grief to which she answered " like you wouldnt believe !!"
negative	i for one will never use a company who_uses_yodel again and if any yodel courier steps foot on my property again i have told them they will be trespassing and i will call the police .
negative	i have had the same experience as others who have written a review on here ( how many have not bothered to review ?)
negative	i ordered a bobble hat as a christmas_present on 00 / 00 / 00 the money was taken from my account the next_day but as of 00th_jan 00 , i have still not received my order .
negative	the item is still advertised as in stock with 0 - 0 days delivery on web_site .
negative	i have contacted them on a number of occasions and only got a standard reply back , my husband rang them and asked for the money to be refunded , which they did not do ????!!!!
negative	!
negative	you would be better off buying your goods from the pro shop at your local club .
negative	well i down '_t think you are going to like this my parcel did not get to the destination i have been fined £_00 . 00 for non delivery you informed me that the parcel was in austria and the person receiving the parcel did not contact you what a load or rubbish when you accepted my money to deliver my parcel you entered into a contract you failed to deliver the parcel so you broke the contract so i am getting legal_advice on this issue and to rub_salt into the wound you now want £_00 to send it back to me . jeff ps i will not be recommending your firm at all
negative	i saw rajapack advertisment through ebay , i thought the prices were resonable so i went_ahead and ordered 000 dvd mailers .
negative	when the package arrived they were the wrong_size , i also noticed i had 0 payments come out from my bank .
negative	i rang your customer_services and they said they couldn_'_t see a problem , so i emailed a scanned_copy of my bank_statement .
negative	i then had a call from rajapack and they told me they were sorry and there was a mistake they took my card_details to refund one of my payments onto my card .
negative	not a great experience especially when i have little spare time to be chasing up banking errors and also not recieving the item i actually ordered .
negative	i won_'_t use rajapack again and i certaily won_'_t be recomending the company to my associates .
negative	regards
negative	pay about 00 pounds a month for an abysmal service .
negative	engineers not showing up three_times now , uncaring customer service team .
negative	do not go near this company !
negative	flowers are age mismatched and of poor quality i '_m 00 year_old working male who is single so i send out a lot of flowers and i '_m very disappointed by what was delivered by this company
negative	we recently_bought a car from these just 0 days ago and already have noticed we have been ripped_off ... the credit agreement is for full price of car on screen even_tho we part - exed our old car .... i noticed it as soon as my wife came home with the paperwork .
negative	we rang to say you havent took the part_ex off the sale just to be told the person i have to deal with as left and wont be back till the end of the week ... so they have now got my old car and log_book and not given me a penny for it ... even_tho they said they would give us 000 part_ex on it .
negative	already got legal_advice as this is obtaining goods by deception .
negative	will let you know the out come of this nightmare .
negative	any member of stoneacre company can contact me at any time to sort this out .
negative	our quote 00000 was signed off & agreed with the sales_person justin with delivery in 0 days time ( 0rd_april ) ... seemed to be a fabulous efficient service !
negative	i called on the day of delivery only to be told that their internal email had not transferred my order and so no delivery .... text book excuse for poor sales system .
negative	so restarted the order again for delivery after the sales / show and 0 days late !
negative	martin lawrence
negative	hello again ,
negative	another courier moan and groan from me , maybe i '_m just unlucky ?
negative	booked a delivery through parcel0go , thought i ' d try city_link , next_day service , city_link failed to collect two_days running .
negative	rang city_link to ask why ?
negative	they said it was an i . t .
negative	problem with their new system and issued a new tracking_number and promise of collection , they also gave_me a number to contact parcel0go for a refund .
negative	rang parcel0go , they said i could not have a refund as there was no guarantee of collection ( basically hard luck !
negative	), they then changed the courier to tnt as they said they were more reliable than city_link ????
negative	?
negative	rang city_link who said only parcel0go could issue a refund ,
negative	at this point i gave up !
negative	city_link let_me down but cant give a refund and parcel0go wont give a refund , where do i stand ???
negative	?
negative	i have refunded my customers post as i '_m an honest kind of guy and don_'_t like people to be let_down , my loss i know but i prefer to be honest .
negative	look at all the other reviews for city_link , what a terrible company record , so bad i suspect the only good reviews are from their employees paid to do so .
negative	update , update , update !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
negative	!
negative	city_link asked me to contact them after_reading this review ,
negative	i did and this is the message i recieved .
negative	good afternoon mr brammer ,
negative	further from my recent email , i am sorry for the delay in responding to you .
negative	thank_you for your patience and understanding .
negative	the depot manager at shrewsbury has_been investigating further and we have discovered that there has_been an it issue , resulting in your consignments not being allocated to their depot for collection .
negative	they have reported the problem to our it department to ensure this gets resolved as quickly as possible .
negative	i understand you have booked a new collection for today , they have confirmed this has now been allocated to a driver to ensure you have no further delays .
negative	once again , please_accept our apologies for the inconvenience or frustration that has_been caused on this occasion .
negative	if there is anything_else i can help you with then do get in touch .
negative	kind_regards ,
negative	s . a .
negative	city_link
negative	this was my response
negative	hello s . a . city_link
negative	once again i have to say i am in disbelief !
negative	you have spent the morning gathering information that i already have ?
negative	did you read my review ?
negative	it clearly_states i was aware of an it problem , i told you that ?
negative	it also states tnt are now the couriers for this consignment and they have collected it in the last hour ,
negative	so why city_link are collecting today as well is beyond me , they probably wont turn_up anyway .
negative	my point is i ’ ve had to refund my customer as he paid for 00 hr courier not 00 hr courier .
negative	i shall now add this further info to my trustpilot review as my time has_been wasted even further what a joke !
negative	end .
negative	what a waste of time , they responded to my review without reading it ,
negative	beggars_belief .
negative	i run a busy ebay shop , have about 000 sales a week and for the last two years used ipostparcels to deliver my parcels ,
negative	recently they started to miss collections so i thought i would give yodel a go , they couldn ’_t be any worse , could they ?
negative	well , after visiting the yodel website , clicking on yodel direct , setting_up an account of i went ,
negative	my first parcel about 0kg and measuring 00cm square was booked in for 00 hr delivery and next_day collection as a tester , the driver arrived , signed for the collection and left me with a collection note , the collection note had a different tracking_number than i was given by the website ?
negative	yodel directs tracking_number starts with yol
negative	yodels tracking_number starts with jd00
negative	pleased my parcel had been collected on time i thought all was well !
negative	next_day i tracked the parcel online , the parcel was at the local wrexham service centre ( yodel ),
negative	not out for delivery as expected ?
negative	i thought let ’_s give them an extra day !
negative	the day after that it was still in wrexham , i rang yodel , the customer service member said he would raise a flag on the parcel and it would be delivered in the next 00_hrs .
negative	the day after that it was still in wrexham , i web chatted with a yodel representative , she said she would raise a flag and asked about the parcel contents .
negative	the day after that it was still in wrexham , , i web chatted again ( now getting a bit angry ) with a yodel representative , he apologised asked about the parcel contents and raised an even bigger flag to find the parcel .
negative	the day after that it was still in wrexham , my customer emailed me to cancel the order as he had lost_patience and bought locally ( don_’_t blame him ), i refunded him in full , total of £_00
negative	i web chatted again ( now getting very angry ) with a yodel representative , he apologised ,
negative	i told_him if the parcel was found to return to my address , he confirmed this would happen .
negative	the day after that the parcel was not in wrexham , it had been delivered five days late to the customer that had cancelled , and not back to me ????
negative	?
negative	yodel chat begins

negative	yodel : 00 : 00 : 00 i apologise about this confusion here , david , but there '_s no notes to show that the parcel was requested to be returned back to you .
negative	david : 00 : 00 : 00 this is the first item i sent with yodel , and what a total_failure it has_been , the live_chat on friday confirmed it would be , i cant_remember the name but it was a man
negative	yodel : 00 : 00 : 00 i apologise about that , david .
negative	if you ' re wanting to retrieve the parcel , then you can book a collection of the parcel from your customer .
negative	david : 00 : 00 : 00 how do i do that ?
negative	yodel : 00 : 00 : 00 you can raise the issue with the yodel direct online web chat team and they will be able to book the collection in for you as well .
negative	david : 00 : 00 : 00 are you saying i have to pay to get it back after its yodels mistake ?
negative	00 : 00 : 00 or can you book it in now ?
negative	yodel : 00 : 00 : 00 i cannot book collections for yodel direct customers , as we ' re technically separate companies .
negative	if you speak with their online web chat team , like you ' re doing with me , you will be able to query this with them .
negative	david : 00 : 00 : 00 another failure , unbelievable waste of time .
negative	yodel : 00 : 00 : 00 i apologise for the inconvenience_caused here , david .
negative	david : 00 : 00 : 00 s far as i can see yodel yodel direct have no contact details or online web chat team
negative	yodel : 00 : 00 : 00 there '_s a help button in the top corner of the page , and it will present you with some questions .
negative	if you answer one of these it will give you a link to the web chat team .
negative	stop ?
negative	lets stop a minute .
negative	question , why is it when you visit yodels web_page the online_chat almost throws itself at you ?
negative	but when you visit yodel directs web_page you have no obvious contact ?
negative	you have to click on help , pick a question and if your lucky an option appears for a web chat ?
negative	hiding like a frightened mouse with no hole to go down and the breath of a hungry cat warming its face ?
negative	now lets continue .
negative	yodel direct chat begins
negative	you are now chatting with yodel direct
negative	yodel : hi david .
negative	yodel : im_afraid this has_been delivered david .
negative	if you wish for this to be returned you will need to make a new order .
negative	david : yodel have delivered this in error , are you saying i have to pay for yodels mistake ?
negative	david : i was told if found it would be sent back to me .
negative	yodel : we was never contacted to advise for this to be returned david .
negative	david : yes you were on friday i had a live_chat and it was confirmed .
negative	yodel : we have never been contacted you chatted with yodel david who as i can see from above told you you needed to contact yodeldirect
negative	david : i contacted yodel who told me once found it would be returned , now after loosing the parcel for five days , upsetting my customer , hours of typing loss of sales , your telling_me i have to pay to get my items back ?
negative	yodel : you have not contacted yodeldirect david which is who you booked with .
negative	this has_been delivered .
negative	david : i contact yodel who told me it would be returned , only this morning did they tell me to contact you , also my item was delivered five days late so i should have a refund on my post
negative	yodel : im_afraid the service which we offer is non guaranteed which is stated when booking david . yodel :
negative	ouch !
negative	ouch !
negative	ouch !
negative	david : your reviews on trustpilot are a disgrace and i can see why , you treat_customers like dirt .
negative	and pass the buck from one side to the other , and for the sake of returning a parcel you have now lost hundreds of deliveries from my company company name , it beggers belief .
negative	yodel : im very sorry to hear this david .
negative	however you booked the order with yodeldirect and we have not been contacted to ask for the item to be returned .
negative	yes booked yodeldirect but given yodel tracking_number frightened mouse !
negative	lets spin a coin , heads it gets delivered tails it dont .
negative	david : in the end its yodels loss , i will write lots of reviews and post them , you will lose my business and many others for the incompetence yodel has shown .
negative	yodel : is there anything_else i can help you with ?
negative	david : you are like a robot , and follow rules but this is no joke repeating the same answer , please can some one superior contact me on phone number
negative	yodel : i am the online supervisor david , as i have advised if you wish for the item to be returned this will be on your own_accord .
negative	david : goodbye yodel , one huge let - down , one joke of a company , one parcel sent and one big_mistake .
negative	and there we have it , i now have to pay to get my items back , there is no refund for late delivery ( 00_hrs took 0 days ) and yodel are two different companies , with two tracking_numbers and probably too many chiefs and not enough indians .
negative	i was given a yodel tracking_number but told i should have contacted yodel direct , confusing isn_'_t it ?
negative	it seems they split the company so one side can blame the other , i mean how do you loose a parcel for 0 days and then make the customer fight for any kind of refund , instead of a refund they kick you whilst your down ?
negative	?.
negative	i post 000 parcels a week if yodel were a football_team they would lose 000 - 0 ever week mostly from own goals , and their manager would be sacked .
negative	nice one yodel , welcome to the conference of couriers .
negative	other reviews say it all .
negative	[_external_reference_] deluged with complaints over yodel '_s poor delivery service
negative	more than 0 , 000 customers call for [_external_reference_] to join [_external references ] in ditching parcel carrier yodel
negative	thank_you for listening ,
negative	regards ,
negative	david .
negative	after many_years of using ipostparcels , i can_honestly_say this company has now gone into complete disarray , one missed collection after another , no phone number , no customer_care , sent emails get no response despite their claims to get back to you in three hours , you are totally at the mercy of a roulette wheel with this company you bet red or black and it comes up a sickly green .
negative	they used to be very good , but i can only think internally they are now in chaos .
negative	goodbye ipostparcels r . i . p
negative	i placed an order on 00th_june , which so_far ( 0_weeks ) has not been delivered .
negative	this may not be their fault but as they have not replied to my email , i have no idea .
negative	therefore i am out of pocket .
negative	they have my money , but i do not have the product .
negative	not recommended .
negative	ordered a samsung product by telephone - ordered on understanding product was in stock .
negative	00 days_later - not delivered , despite 0 email and 0 telephone_calls from me .
negative	all promises and no action .
negative	now told it may be despatched on day 00 .
negative	se full of polite apologies .
negative	that '_s no help to me .
negative	but they banked my money immediately upon order date . do they really expect me to buy from them again ?
negative	i shall now contact samsung and ask why they supply such rogues as these_people obviously are .
negative	advice to new buyers : don_'_t touch them with a barge_pole .
negative	tried to rip me off for some work to be done .
negative	now to honest they are great for mot testing , but my car failed and the garage quoted me £_000 to replace a coil spring , not clued on this sort of thing but thankfully i said need to speak to the other half first , got home and phoned an other garage who quoted me £_00 for the same work , sadly this is not the first time they quoted stupid prices , quoted my wife for repair work , and it was not even the problem , which would mean paying twice .
negative	i will not use this company again nor would i recommend it .
negative	love a superdry but annoyed the top button has fallen_off and i '_ve lost it .
negative	went to windsor store where the sales_assistant suggested " i went to a button shop to buy a replacement ".
negative	i had not taken the jumper with me however , i stayed calm and walked out .
negative	it '_s just annoying to post back the jumper as i '_ve thrown the receipt away and the jumper is 0_weeks old .
negative	ordered mother '_s day flowers and paid extra £_00 to make it large .
negative	flowers arrived day early and was very small ( 00 flowers in total ).
negative	initially thought it was the usual special_occasion rip_off until my wife received her flowers from my daughters via interflora , which was at_least twice the size and cheaper .
negative	logged complaint and sent photos of flowers and was advised the bouquet was the correct_size but offered a discount on future order .
negative	declined offer and said i would leave negative_feedback and was then asked to send a birdseye view of the flowers .
negative	surprise_surprise they agreed bouquet was wrong_size .
negative	was offered £ 0 refund stating i had only made it medium .
negative	i pointed_out my online invoice clearly_stated i had paid £_00 to make it large .
negative	finally agreed to refund my money , refused compensation and again offered discount on future order .
negative	checked their policy and clearly_stated compensation paid , on querying why i was not getting compensation was advised - " policy refers to our florist orders which are hand delivered - your order was a courier one " - i have had to fight this company all the way just to get my money back would never use again and advise others not to as well .
negative	had oil and vinegar drizzlers bought me as a gift .
negative	returned them by post (£ 0 . 00 ) as both stoppers kept rising out of the bottles rendering them useless .
negative	procook told me that only one bottle acted thus and they would not be refunding my postage as i had not phoned them first for an authorisation_code !
negative	firstly , i do not like being called a liar .
negative	secondly , someone should train them up in customer_services and teach them not to tell their bread and butter whether their goods work or not .
negative	i had never_heard of procook until i received this gift but will make_sure i never by from them .
negative	they are okay if you register before days like easter .
negative	i ordered my domain on friday ( it '_s now saturday ) and they have said i have to wait for monday !
negative	this is fustrating !
negative	live_chat not very helpful neither .
negative	ordered a garden storage_unit it arrived late and damaged .
negative	kybotech put all_sorts of obstacles in the way to avoid paying a refund .
negative	and you have to call a premium_rate number .
negative	i booked a vehicle on line from economy_car_rentals in march_0000 for a week in august that they described on their website as ‘ intermediate , ford_focus or similar ’ and the capacity of the boot was described as ‘ 0 large suitcases 000_litres and 0 small suitcases 00 litres ’.
negative	i deliberately did not book the small car option .
negative	when we arrived to pick_up the vehicle at dalaman_airport in turkey the representative from sax car_rental presented us with a tiny renault_clio .
negative	i explained that this was not the type of car i had paid and after insisting that this was not satisfactory she made a call to her manager and then told me there was no other car available and that as far as the rental company was concerned i could take it or leave it .
negative	by now the whole family and all our holiday luggage was on a petrol_station forecourt in the dark next to a busy_road leading to the airport .
negative	we had no alternative but to put all our_luggage into the boot and back seat and accept the vehicle .
negative	when i complained to economy_car_rentals they investigated and then copied me in on a very rude email from their representatives sax car_rental suggesting that a renault_clio was the same size as a ford_focus with the same boot capacity !
negative	sax concluded that “ the tourists think that they found something to complain and a probability to get refunded .”
negative	economy_car_rentals have accepted no responsibility for their representative in turkey and have ignored my correspondence , so i can only conclude that they too benefit from charging customers for an intermediate size vehicle and then pocket excessive profits by providing a small lower tariff vehicle .
negative	don_’_t hire from these_crooks .
negative	my broadband goes down at_least a couple of times a day , often more .
negative	i '_m a former computer support engineer , so i know that it '_s not a fault at my end .
negative	contacting bt to report a fault is next to impossible and call_centre staff , although polite enough , are no help at all .
negative	my wife has taken to sending a text every time that we lose our connection to say that she wants to cancel our contract because they are in breach of it by not providing an acceptable service .
negative	she '_s sent a lot of messages and has had not a single reply .
negative	this is a company that loses interest in you as a customer the moment you take a contract with them .
negative	i '_ll be leaving them as soon as possible .
negative	i moved_house last november to a house with 0 prepayment meters ( gas + electric ), from the previous_owners .
negative	one week before i moved i asked scottish_power to assure me that i wouldn_'_t be paying more than i should or be paying off someone_elses debt , what tariff i would be on and how to get these meters removed .
negative	i '_ve had no reply despite_repeated mails to them and making a formal_complaint .
negative	they replied to the complaint addressing me by the previous_owners name and didn_'_t address any of my questions .
negative	i seem to be paying a fortune and have begun switching supply to another_provider .
negative	as soon as i '_m able to i will contact the ombudsman and will_continue to try and find out what amount i should have been paying .
negative	they don_'_t appear even remotely interested .
negative	avoid this company at all costs !
negative	waited in for engineer but no show and no service .. called them and was passed around but although promised a callback it never happened ... so tonight after_reading all these reviews cancelled my order ... been transferred to the phiilapines / uk and bangalore ...
negative	just to cancel ..
negative	will take the advice of cancelling any direct_debits - even_though i have never had service ..
negative	think i have had a lucky_escape ...
negative	what a disaster that amazon has changed lovefilm , i lost all my reviews , making me unsure now what i have rented , got rid of the ability to see all my past rentals over 00 , made it extremely hard and confusing to navigate and search for films .
negative	if you type say sean connery films there is not a year of release option , just a crap popularity one and dvd relesase one so for example dr no came out in 0000 , but it shows the latest release of the film instead of its year of release .
negative	another issue is my rental list list showing releases in a disorganised way .
negative	utter shit .
negative	why of why did amazon destroy such a great service that was called lovefilm .
negative	i ordered a set of ' ceramic frying_pans ' ( 0 piece set # 0000 ) for £_00 - 00 as shown in easylife catalogue .
negative	what i received from easylife on the 00 oct_0000 was a 0 piece set # 0000 , - same price .
negative	i only realised the product was incorrect 0months later when i returned from holiday .
negative	however , i started_using the pans .
negative	very soon the " ultimate non - stick nano ceramic coating " failed .
negative	this is a poor quality product not worth the £ 0 - 00 delivery charge !
negative	wish i had read trustpilot reviews .
negative	' life ' will be much ' easier ' without this sham of a company .
negative	( reluctantly have to award 0_star !)
negative	you order things , and days_later after chasing , they finally tell you it '_s out of stock and you '_ll get a refund , ok , that would be fine if , they didn_'_t have multiple companies around the uk that they own , doing the exact_same thing !
negative	so you can try by the products elsewhere thinking it '_s in stock , get charged , then the same thing , they finally tell you they own the companies too
negative	is it really that hard to keep your stock updated online ?!
negative	three_times !
negative	this is like all the so called cheap fair companies .
negative	my experience is you get what you pay for but with this one you pay over the top for less .
negative	my wife went from edingburgh to amsterdam , by sleazy jet the cost came out at over £_000 for a cheap seat !
negative	by jet0 leeds amsterdam even more for a 00 pence seat , by klm edi to ams £_000 return including meals both_ways .
negative	easy jet should be renamed hardist jet .
negative	crap company and even crapier service .
negative	go here at your_peril , they don_'_t give a crap for your problems , just get you on board so they can claim another satisfied customer , yeh right .
negative	they broke their own contract , then they wanted me to pay for their cockup .
negative	if you are considering it don_'_t .
negative	ordered a pair of trainers in january .
negative	after paying online received an email a few_days_later saying the item was not in stock .
negative	obtained a refund .
negative	ordered again in february when trainers were back in stock but after 0_weeks nothing received .
negative	phoned millets sports who said they were again out of stock and i would have to wait another 0_weeks , so 0_weeks total .
negative	still_waiting .
negative	we ordered a suite for delivery in feb , the delivery date was given to us .
negative	we sold our old suite for £_000 and the lady was due to collect from hull , she had hired a van .
negative	we then get a phone_call to say that our suite hadnt even been made and that the delivery was not going ahead .
negative	we had to cancel the sale of our suite and pay her £_00 compensation for her inconvenience .
negative	we explained this to the md and he said ' your problem not ours ' a couldnt care less attitude .
negative	two new dates were arranged but we had to postpone due to urgent family issues .
negative	the we get a letter from ( name ) saying that they wanted to cancel the contract and give us a refund due to us not being abl to take delivery on 00 / 0 / 00 when we are out of the country .
negative	this company are a joke , my wife saw red and told them to cancel the order and a refund is now anticipated .
negative	i wouldnt recommend this outfit to my own worst enemies they couldnt give a damn about loyalty to customers and they really dont realise that without us they wont continue in business .
negative	before you buy from them google nitrotek complaints and read a few .
negative	i bought an a00 thunderbolt plane that from the word go had two unbalanced engines which would not even taxi in a straight line .
negative	sent the engines back - they could not find anything wrong .
negative	i sent it all back under the distance_selling_regulations as faulty .
negative	nearly a week_later no replies , no acknowledgement and no refund .
negative	fortunately i paid by credit_card so will be pursuing them for refund and return postage_costs .
negative	i have family staying at the weekend and required a new mattress , i ordered in time for me to have a thursday delivery , duly waited in for the delivery and nothing turned_up .
negative	at 00 : 00 i receive a call telling_me it would not be there until the following wednesday .
negative	despite explaining the problem to the advisor and requesting an_alternative , they informed me that they would not be doing anything to rectify the problem other than cancelling the payment should i wish .
negative	do not use this firm , unless you want your day totally_ruined by people that have no conscience or customer service professionalism of course !
negative	having ordered the chair from the site was easy and delivery was prompt but the quality of the product is way below acceptable standards .
negative	the chair is made of mediocre quality matierials , the fillings is too light and in 0 days of use the seat has already gone shapeless and flat .
negative	the height_adjustment lever hardly does any work apart_from going up and down by couple of inches and it doesnt really go as low as most other chairs .
negative	the saet is fixed andcant be slided out or in and it doesnt support the entire lenght of the thighs thus putting a lot of stress on the lower back .
negative	over and above the chair is not meant to be used more than few_months .
negative	i am definately chucking this one in the bin by end of the month .
negative	don_'_t buy from these , needed to cancel order , tried to charge me 00_% of total order to cancel it - how they still exist is beyond me .
negative	don_'_t be taken in by their cheap prices , or promises of good customer_support - this company , it seems , is a sham .
negative	ordering a laptop , i was given a 0 - 0 day delivery window .
negative	once ordered , the order status page then gave_me 0 - 00 days .
negative	those 00 working_days have passed , and yet the order status is still ' on time '.
negative	spending 00_minutes waiting for someone to answer my call , an indian lass answered , citing a ' delay ' in getting it dispatched , as if it were a valid excuse .
negative	' next week ' she pulled_out of the air .
negative	never going to happen .
negative	they don_'_t have the stock , plain and simple .
negative	getting a refund , or else my bank is getting involved .
negative	do not ; i repeat do not under any circumstance think of dealing_with these jokers .
negative	i guarantee you , wae_+ will not exist in 0 months time .
negative	confirmed payments but no money .
negative	james_villas have some great properties but if you have a problem with a property they do not help in any way as you will see from other review sites .
negative	we booked a top of the range villa in costa_blanca a while back .
negative	we had checked with the company to find the best villa for our needs - in a quiet area near shops and facilities so the kids could be a bit independant , and when we arrived at the villa it was miles from the town on a main_road , totally opposite to our requirements .
negative	the villa furthermore was very dirty , the beds were very short ( 0 ' 0 ") and as our boys were 0 ' 0 " and 0 ' 0 " respectively were unfit for purpose .
negative	we were told that as spanish people are shorter_than english people the size was normal for the area !
negative	the sofa was filthy and consisted of a narrow plank across as a seat which was not only uncomfortable but dangerous as we kept falling down the holes on either side , the only other chair broke the first time it was used , the kitchen was infested with insects ( rep told me that if i cleaned it they should go away - this was in our first day so left like this for us ); and there was a building site across the road and as the pool was in the front_garden it couldn_'_t be used as dust blew across it all day , never mind the noise from drill , men , cars etc .
negative	we rang immediately after arrival to ask to be moved or flown home , they had no other villa in the area available and could not get us on a flight home until our due date in two_weeks .
negative	we couldn_'_t stay in the villa so had to book into a hotel that cost mega bucks as we hadn_'_t pre booked and what did james_villas offer a compensation - yes you '_ve guessed it not a penny .
negative	as i say lots of you have had great holidays , but if a problem they leave you high and dry and don_'_t help at all , oh sorry the rep did bring a desk fan so the windows could be kept shut at night because of the road_noise , didn_'_t go far between five of us .
negative	james_villas shame on you
negative	whenever we have bought phones through carphone_warehouse there have been problems when it comes to a ) cancelling contract at the end of the term , b ) sorting_out problems with the phones .
negative	we always ended_up with a fight on our hands as they consistently state they never received notification of the contact cancelling so you end up paying for numerous extra months .
negative	you can never get a straight answer out of the staff either on the phone or in store , it is always someone_else who needs to help you !!
negative	!
negative	purchased a blu_ray on 00 october .
negative	told that it wasn_'_t in stock and no details of when it would be available .
negative	cancelled order but they still took the money and no refund to date .
negative	telephone doesn_'_t get answered .
negative	the comapny is a sham and it is about time either trading_standards or the isp '_s collectively do something to stop consumers being_ripped_off yet again
negative	i think that most of the time , when one sends flowers to another person , it is unlikely that the sender will ever actually see them .
negative	and what kind of person_who receives those flowers would say to the sender that they are horrible ; not a british person , that '_s for sure , we ' re just too polite .
negative	i happened to visit my mum a few_days after mothers_day and was absolutely shocked to see that half of the blooms were wilted , crusty , brown and dry .
negative	of course , my mum didn_'_t say anything to me when i asked over the phone , but then she didn_'_t know i would be visiting .
negative	this bouquet was £_00 , but i wouldn_'_t have paid more than £_00 if i purchased the same ones from a store .
negative	in fact , i have seen bouquets with fewer shrivelled buds and blooms at the local costcutters for £ 0 .
negative	two of them would have made an equally_impressive bouquet .
negative	given there are plenty of favourable_reviews here , i can forgive anyone who thinks i '_m over - exaggerating .
negative	and don_'_t get me wrong , i do not think that all bouquets are delivered like this .
negative	however , i would say that i very seldom write_reviews unless i am either extremely impressed or appalled .
negative	unfortunately , on this occasion , it is the latter .
negative	nick
negative	i ordered a product from this site , which was a hamster cage .
negative	when i ordered from the website i chose a green cage and continued to buy the product .
negative	but when the product was delivered with over excessive bubble wrapping , which was hard to unwrap , it was infact a light blue cage .
negative	not what i ordered .
negative	i was very disappointed , as it was my first purchase from the site .
negative	i ordered a shower_seal which was supposed to have a 00mm flap .
negative	the one i have received has at most a 00mm .
negative	i called on friday to complain and re order i was told nobody is available and someone would contact me asap .
negative	by tuesday still no contact so i called back i was again told nobody was available but was assured i would be contacted back that day so_far nothing .
negative	very poor customer service so_far .
negative	shop barred me from buying 00 tins of dog_food .
negative	0_weeks supply for an springer_spaniel .
negative	food was not on special_offer i was told i could only buy 00 items of the same line .
negative	this means i could not do a weeks shopping at once .
negative	went elsewhere , haven_'_t been back .
negative	i was told by customer service i would have to contact the store manager a few_days before going shopping and he may be able to arrange the purchase of a weeks dog_food .
negative	the website shop would not let_me despatch the goods to a place other than the billing_address and would not record the fact that i wanted gift_wrap etc .
negative	in the end i gave up and telephoned
negative	next_day delivery didn_'_t happen it took three three_days .
negative	we have had a refund on postage but not on the product .
negative	i refused took accept the late delivery .
negative	on picking_up the car i was questioned_why i hadn_'_t picked_up from the ferry_terminal .
negative	the issue i have is that i attempeted to modify my booking so that i could pick my car up from the ferry_terminal instead of the train_station .
negative	however i was told that '' unfortunately we are unable to amend the booking as requested as there are o vehicles available from saint malo ferry_port .''
negative	this was clearly not the case , as i was informed by the attendant that all cars are from the same fleet .
negative	i suspect that i recieved the answer i did from you as i refused the no claims waiver i was offered over the phone .
negative	your service is not very good because i paid for next_day delivery i was confedent that everything would be ok .
negative	i had ordered a car vent mount for a blackberry_0000 ( 0000 ).
negative	it was listed for about £_00 .
negative	londonmagicstore cancelled the order then re - listed it for £_00 . 00 on both amazon and ebay .
negative	on ebay the item had showed 000 sold ..... not for that price .
negative	cashing in on christmas !
negative	avoid them they are hyping all their prices .
negative	i booked and paid for a premium_economy flight with expedia .
negative	the ticket arrived via_email showing economy status . i phoned to tell them of their ' mistake ' and was informed that i had only booked an economy ticket .
negative	i explained that i wanted to travel the day before and by the time ( 0 mins ) that i had got through to the payment screen the quoted price had increased by over 000_pounds .
negative	i went back to the website , changed the flying day to the following_day , original price quoted , and quickly booked before the price could change .
negative	0 calls later , hours on the phone , being told it was my fault for contacting them half hour after they had paid the airline ( this was within one hour of receiving my economy email tickets ).
negative	i have been offered the opportunity to cancel for one hundred and fifty_pounds or upgrade to a service that i have already paid for at the cost of three hundred_pounds .
negative	why is this ridiculous company still in operation ?
negative	do not use expedia , they are expert scammers .
negative	flowers lasted for 0 days then looked dead , despite fresh water each day ,, and cut tips off storks , very dissapointed , wont use this company again ,, girlfriend very upset ....
negative	despite my copy of the invoice showing clearly that the delivery address is my home , you managed to locate a three year_old address and send my glasses to afghanistan .
negative	thanks
negative	i made the mistake of thinking . com would be the same as the store the similarities end at the name , i oredered a £_000 value item for my wife as part of her xmas , despatched 00th00 , signed and recieved 00th 00 , really !!!
negative	well not by me or to me it wasnt after a few emails and some form repsonses , i called them direct was told it had been sent by hermes , ( see reviews ) who are just a joke , the signature was ilegible i was told and no printed surname availble good eh !!.
negative	i was then told i would be called before 00 . 00 next_day by both the call_centre and email .
negative	dept , the call never came , guess_what though the package did .
negative	around 0pm 0 days_later had been opened , handed to me with a grunt by some bloke in a motor with parcels lying all over the back seat , ( some opened ) never had to sign for it good eh i could have been anyone , ?
negative	anyway i logged compliant with john_lewis got a form response of its been passed here there and around , and the hermes company have been informed big deal , not even a sorry you were not called back or were it was first sent to why it was opened and who did indeed sign for it and why did i not have to ??
negative	you have been_warned steer_well clear folks
negative	ordered still not received despite paying for next_day delivery , emailed had no reply mailed again asking were my order is a further day later and another day still no reply and no watch avoid at all costs ,
negative	note
negative	after this review i finally got a reply and a postal refund and eventually the watch which they posted to my invoice_address and not my delivery address ,
negative	if you ever have to return a faulty item as i did in this case a cheap electric_planer with a clear design flaw .
negative	then dont hold your breath for a refund , as there refund policy is way over regulated every item has to be sent to a tech lab for testing 00 to 00 working_days_later you may get a refund , buyer_beware
negative	not anymore though .
negative	heres why greed !!!
negative	00_% of all items sold fee , plus listing_fees plus photos plus paypal_fees whats the point .!!
negative	and further more .
negative	this is the kicker if your a seller and the buyer chooses not pay you you cant leave negative feeback because thats not fair haaa !!
negative	but they can not only not pay you but leave you negative feeback brilliant idea ebay !!!
negative	whats needed here is competition folks
negative	i went to this company on the strength of the testimonials or there site , big_mistake .
negative	i sent a small chain away to them the value , the value they gave was some £_00 below my local shop , so i declined the offer it was then as they put it re - offered at £_00 more than the original and still below my high_street .
negative	so be ware i guess of accepting first offers and own web_site testimonials , give people an honest value at the start and you will get the business is the moral , ps , i took there " improved offer as for the extra £ 0 i would have got from the high_street in the end i could not be_bothered and i guess someone_who has lots of gold would be so its all relevant
negative	i made 0 orders to wiggle before my recent cycling holiday in spain both of them have been a disaster .
negative	both orders were not acknowledged by email one was delivered by collect_+ to my local_spar and i couldn_'_t pick it up without the email even_though i had the order number and id
negative	the other was deliver 00 days after order even_though i had paid extra for first_class delivery
negative	i have contacted the 0 times by email and have not received one reply
negative	are they going bust ?
negative	i ended_up buying everything in spain at decathlon which i would recommend !
negative	i had a problem with the website as it would not let_me select my preferred fitting depot .
negative	however on phoning your helpline they made the order for me .
negative	i was told the tyre would be ready for me the next_day but on contacting depot i was told i could come in anytime .
negative	i took_advantage of this and the tyre was quickly fitted .
negative	this is not the first time i have used tyre_shopper and will_continue to do so .
negative	i have never been dissapointed !
negative	actually service they providing is very poor .. also broadband and home line is slow and if you want to complaint to customer service firstly to take you forever reach the right agent and let you wait 0hour + on the phone paying from your own pocket .
negative	actually had to phone them 0 + times before they send me a technician to come check my home line ... also they promised me some broadband_speed but they supplied me with 0 . 0mbps which was slower_than my mobile_phone internet from 0 .. when im complaint and threatened to cancel my contract and go to another_provider they give me a best offer ever to keeping_me in with refreshing my contract but also try to charge my sky high fee for cancellation when i am gone ... so had been forced to stay with them for next year .
negative	but it was not finish my story after 0month they themselves were cancelled my special customer offer and set_up new direct_debit for £_00 a month which was more than i am paid in my first year of contract 0 years_ago .. so on end of all this i managed to reduce my cost but take me ages to do it almost 0months and cost me fortune on phone_calls and mistakes they made with no any compensation ... so i can not wait to change for different telephone and broadband_provider with better service ... people don_'_t go with bt there are lots of different companies with better deals and prices ... i trust the bt because the name and such the size of company but they disappointed me on the full line ....
negative	forget using mm .... once they have your money they don_'_t care about anything_else .
negative	they don_'_t take_responsibility or deal effectively with customer problems , customer_services is a joke ...
negative	they don_'_t work after 0 or at weekends .
negative	totally disappointed that they don_'_t live up to promises or indeed their side of a contractual arrangement .
negative	it took the money from my card very soon , but it haven_'_t dispatched the order for over one month !
negative	and no one respond the email and phone_call !
negative	!
negative	värdelöst med frakt som kostar både för_att_få varan och returnera den .
negative	jag betalade 00 kr för_att prova ett par skor som_var för stora i storleken .
negative	pga detta kommer jag aldrig handla hos junkyard igen .
negative	i was led to believe that postage was free but it was added on to my credit_card bill without me knowing .
negative	looking back , i noticed in very small_print that postage was only free for larger_amounts .
negative	tesco used to be up with the leaders but sadly this is no_longer so .
negative	the service is poor and the staff not motivated .
negative	the management should look back to where they went so wrong .
negative	always had good service in the past , but delivery company said they could not find our house this time , although we have had deliveries made by many companies in the past without issue .
negative	dealing_with wallsandfloors . co . uk started off really well , it was easy to place an order and you can even specify the day you want it delivered , adding to the order , if you forget items , is also easy just phone up and the staff will give you a code for free_postage , adding it to your existing order when the parcel it up .
negative	unfortunately the day you specify isn_'_t necessarily the day you will get the order , as was my experience , however i did get a call at lunchtime that day to say i wasn_'_t coming having spent the morning waiting for the delivery .
negative	the girl on the end of the phone was very apologetic and stressed that it would be delivered the following_day and that even_though i had given them over a weeks notice for the delivery date they had just failed to complete the paperwork .
negative	i informed them that the guy fixing the tiles was arriving the next_day and that i could put him off until 00 am but unlike most professionals in the building industry he actually turns_up when he states .
negative	the delivery would have been anytime the next_day however and they could not specify a time , even_though they had admitted it was their mistake they wouldn_'_t do a before 00am ( this is the reason for the 0_star ) also their refund policy is shocking at 00 days .
negative	i recently_purchased a bathroom_suite from bathstore chelmsford , all went to plan up until delivery day .
negative	on opening the box_containing the sink basin i found the enamel to be scratched , i immediately contacted the store and arranged a replacement which was a 0 week wait .
negative	eventually the store made contact to inform_me that the sink was in and ready to collect .
negative	when i arrived at the store i was handed a beaten up box_containing my new basin and considering the state of the packaging i thought it prudent to check the sink before leaving the store .
negative	on opening the box i found the sink was covered in mud and dirt with deep_scratches all over !
negative	when i turned to the store manager for an explanation his answer was " well it is from our budget range what do you expect " this left me not only furious but also in an awkward_position as i had already installed the bath and toilet , i could not wait another 0_weeks for another replacement so i was effectively forced to keep my old sink .
negative	hence to say , i will never ever buy anything from bathstore chelmsford or any other bathstore outlet again , they are nothing short of crooks dealing in second rate and damaged stock , their staff are rude , unhelpful with no morals .
negative	avoid at all costs
negative	i ordered flowers on 0 . 00 . 00 for my mother '_s birthday which was on 00 . 00 . 00 . the cost of the flowers was £_00 . 00 to which they added £ 0 . 00 for same day delivery even_though i had ordered 0 days in advance .
negative	on the 00 . 00 . 00 they didn_'_t arrive so i sent an email to iflorist which was greeted_by a holding reply saying that the florist had delivered . i knew that the delivery address had been occupied all day and that they had not delivered .
negative	i sent several emails asking for proof of delivery and nothing more has_been heard from this company - i must also state that i was unable to contact them by phone because that facility was not available .
negative	my advice to anyone_thinking of using this company is don_'_t .
negative	they are very good at taking your money but useless at delivering flowers .
negative	€ 00 . 00 for " out of hours " at 0000 !!!!
negative	!
negative	charged for damage that was not done during hire , was even checked when car was returned !!
negative	!
negative	europcar mallta are complete thieves , avoid like the plague , real con_men .
negative	i read good reviews for panelbase , it was even at the top of some survey lists .
negative	however , my experience with them has_been the opposite .
negative	very , very few surveys in comparison with other survey sites like valued opinions or mysurvey .
negative	there is a very tedious profiling section to be completed at the beginning and it '_s all for nothing .
negative	most of the time i '_m not even eligible for their surveys , yet they give them to me anyway ( at most one per week ).
negative	terrible site and an_absolute waste of time .
negative	avoid .
negative	nothing good to say about it - really hate this site .
negative	their origin service is atrocious , their downloadable content schemes pathetic , and their respect for gamers nowhere to be found .
negative	whilst they put out some decent games , gamers have to go against their principles to purchase them .
negative	they '_ve taken enough franchises under their wing and prematurely buried them - amongst them some of my favourites .
negative	and yet , all they have to do is respond to their criticism and listen to the customers .
negative	the customer is always right , and ea should finally open their eyes to see that .
negative	by the way , just look_elsewhere online to see the appalling services that ea have provided .
negative	i don_'_t know how a company like dell can continue running their business with their current customer_support base .
negative	their hardware is okay , far from the best out there , but does the job ... until some hidden self - destruct mechanism goes off after a predetermined time ( that '_s my belief anyway ).
negative	i had a laptop for about three years before it kicked the bucket , and , to my surprise , i had forgotten about the warranty that i had with it .
negative	it was actually due to run out about a month after the time of the laptop dying .
negative	called up support , was redirected to india and was put on the line with totally_unhelpful staff that i couldn_'_t understand , and who probably couldn_'_t understand me .
negative	if you think it '_s as simple as saying " my laptop is broken , and the warranty covers it , please come and send assistance " then think again .
negative	after hours of multiple calls - each new call starting the whole_process over again - i was getting_nowhere .
negative	first off , they don_'_t believe you .
negative	they tried to diagnose my near dead laptop over the phone , which was an_absolute_nightmare .
negative	i managed to somehow spark some life into it and go through a few bios checks over the phone with dell .
negative	the results of that ?
negative	inconclusive , but they " suspected " different problems .
negative	i had to get a family_member braver than i to shout down the phone at them to send an engineer out .
negative	on and on this went , and then they finally did their job , sent an engineer out who didn_'_t have the proper equipment .
negative	on the phone again , they send another engineer who actually fixes the laptop .
negative	woo !
negative	then the laptop dies of the same problem two months later .
negative	to summarise : avoid dell if you value your_sanity .
negative	i identified the nextbase click and go 0 dup as it appeared to be the safest , most convenience portable dvd_player for in - car use .
negative	however , the headrest mounts supplied do not fit volvos and in my email to the company seeking clarification on this , they referred me to the mounts they sell separately ( supplied by brodit ).
negative	however , these mounts are utterly rubbish and completely undo the principle offered by the nextbase stanchion mounts !
negative	don_'_t buy these if you are fitting in a volvo .
negative	this is the worst customer service i have ever received .
negative	initially was refunded for items not provided in the shipping .
negative	the second time however was when the charger for my lavatube shorted while charging batteries , both malfunctioned .
negative	was requested to send back the charger , which i did at my own_expense .
negative	e_- mailed the company several_times , 00 days_later and still no response , no_indication of whether i '_ll be getting a refund or replacement for the cheapo charger they provide .
negative	avoid !
negative	flowers delivered with no card no message and didnt look anything spectacular and not as good as they looked in the picture .
negative	were a wedding_anniversary_gift and very dissappointed .
negative	when complained and asked or a refund was given a refund only for the card not delivered and that was then end of it .
negative	would not recommend this comany to anyone .
negative	as i call them , over priced , un friendly staff ... not a great place at all
negative	very poor in my area .
negative	you even get points when you buy food , which we used to do every friday , i spent my points on something and i am still_waiting for the goods ( 0 years nearly ) everytime i ask they say they are still sorting it out .
negative	delivery was slow and so the food was cold
negative	ideal if your a chav ... tacky stuff
negative	so_far i '_m up to about 00 emails to this company trying to sort_out a refund .
negative	they failed to deliver on time so i cancelled as per distance_selling_regulations .
negative	they tried to deliver on a later date and forged my signature for the delivery - i was twenty miles_away in a meeting at the time .
negative	i haven_'_t had a single useful response from asos , good luck finding their phone number but here is an address to write to :
negative	asos head_office
negative	greater london house
negative	hampstead road
negative	london , nw0 0fb
negative	united_kingdom
negative	i used this company to send flowers to my wife , for a very important anniversary .
negative	they didn_'_t arrive on the day & when they did arrive , looked nothing like the web display .
negative	i complained but no satisfaction was given , this company doesn_'_t care about repeat_business , there are plenty of other mugs to bite .
negative	bought two front tyres & had them fitted by one of their so called expert tyre_fitters .
negative	within two_days my front off side tyre decided to remove itself from the wheel_rim on the m00 motorway .
negative	i had the tyre inspected by a independent tyre_fitting company ( ruislip tyres ) who told me the old valves were not replaced & had failed .
negative	blackcircles retrieved the tyre for inspection & told me that they would contact me when they knew more .
negative	never_heard a thing for 0 months , so i contacted them , they just told me there was nothing wrong with the tyre .
negative	the tyres they sold me were very dangerous & the fitting_station they recommended was rubbish .
negative	ordered a couple of pc parts totalling just under £_000 .
negative	even paid £ 0 . 00 for the express delivery ( 0 - 0 days ).
negative	was given an expected delivery date of 0 - 0 days_later than the 0 days for the express delivery .
negative	decided that i would wait for the estimated delivery date .
negative	this is the last day but still no sign of the items so i e_- mailed and called the customer_services .
negative	i was told that the item was not at their warehouse but that it was expected to arrive today .
negative	this however , means that the item will not get sent until monday and i will not receive it until tuesday ( 0 days after the express delivery i paid for and 0 days_later than the estimated delivery dates given !!!)
negative	at the time of ordering the parts they were " in stock ".
negative	at no point in all this was i informed that the item i ordered in was not in stock and would take longer to get here .
negative	had i been informed of this i would have cancelled my order and gone elsewhere .
negative	when i called them and spoke to their customer_services i asked for a refund on my express delivery as they had not kept to the time frame .
negative	at this point i was told that i could have a store credit but not a refund to my card .
negative	as if i would want to use them again after this experience .
negative	time will now tell as to whether the parts arrive on tuesday or not but i will_certainly never use wae_+ again and will not be recommending them to anyone_else .
negative	bought 0 toilets , 0 sinks and a tap a few weeks back .
negative	was emailed to say would be dispatched last monday , but then nothing .. no one picks_up the phone or answers emails !
negative	after quite a few attempts managed to get through and insisted on speaking to their sales_manager , who is alex featherstone .
negative	he promised me that someone would get back to me yesterday , no one did .
negative	terrible company .
negative	it has a premium_rate number for after sales which just seems like a scam .
negative	i '_m not sure i trust the positive_reviews on here .
negative	delivered this morning for my daughter '_s 0th birthday , they were supposed to be a small treat just to make her smile and feel loved .
negative	half_dead , dry and colourless , they were possibly the worst bunch of flowers i have ever had the misfortune to see .
negative	whilst i didn_'_t expect anything too grand given the low_cost , i would at_least have expected them to look alive .
negative	would never use this company again and would recommend that people stay clear .
negative	ordered my flowers on 00 / 0 / 00 for delivery on 00 / 0 / 00 they have '_t arrived still no email or anything , i have called them 00times no one ever picked_up the phone ... avoid them !!!!
negative	!
negative	00 / 0 / 00 still no email or flowers what a scammers !!
negative	!
negative	i turned_up to collect my prescription and the pharmacist told me that i had nothing to collect , he knew nothing about the on line doctor service provided by superdrug and had to ask a sales_assistant if that was correct .
negative	he then spent 00_minutes trying to contact the right person on the ' phone to confirm my prescription had been ordered .
negative	whilst apologetic for the delay and confusion he did not engender any confidence in superdrug or it '_s staff and procedures .
negative	i am highly unlikely to use the service again .
negative	if they dident waste so much money on other things and built some masts or what ever u call them . perhaps we could get some good internet signal completely_useless i have galaxy_s0 one of the top phones but useless on vodafone ; was on tmobile and was brill going back asap .
negative	price is ok , but customer service is slow and near non - existant
negative	chose one of the highest_rated places on just eat .
negative	they didnt deliver anything .
negative	complained on the chat system and they spoke to the pizza place who are adamant i took the food .
negative	just eat then removed my negative_review of the pizza place .
negative	avoid !
negative	you are fine so long as there is no issues with your order .
negative	first order was 0 000gb_hard_drives , delivered 0 000gb_hard_drives .
negative	when requested the correct product was told it was end of life and these were the equivalent .
negative	wouldnt send me 000gb drives and was very hard to get a refund .
negative	next order was needed next_day , paid for next_day delivery but items not sent .
negative	now wont refund the postage cost despite me telling them to cancel the order when they werent delivered .
negative	zero service , bad_experience .
negative	just go to dabs or amazon .
negative	bought 0 products with next_day delivery , both were faulty .
negative	no replacement offered just store credit , i complained about having to pay delivery charge again and asked that my original delivery charge be refunded as i did not get a working product next_day .
negative	i was fobbed_off and ignored until i was contacted by the customer service manager who told me they had processed a refund of the cost of the parts with no mention of the cost of the delivery charge or the cost to return the 0 parts , now they are ignoring my emails .
negative	i have nothing to show for my order and its cost me money .
negative	worst customer service ever do not use cos if they mess up your order it will cost you to fix .
negative	i had booked and paid in advance then when i called en_route to airport you had no record of my booking , but said someone could come out .
negative	i said i was going to t0 , then when i called from t0 they said driver had gone to t0 , he was rude_unhelpful saying it was nothing to do with him , and threatened to not come and collect my car .
negative	i was not impressed and now about to miss my plane so a very helpful man from a competitor offered to assist and take my car .
negative	i just made my plane , and on my return my car was waiting for me - very efficient service from meteor .
negative	only good service was from gill darby who has emailed , apologised and refunded my money .
negative	it is unlikely i will be using mgp again .
negative	whilst the order was placed over christmas and ny - i was disappointed that it was not dispatched for at_least 0 days and then took a further 0 days to get to the uk .
negative	by this time i was back at work and no_longer at home to recieve the package .
negative	i am still yet to pick this up from my post_office so i cannot_comment on the quality of the item ordered .
negative	i order a lot of items online and this was the only delayed service i received .
negative	going forward i will stick to using mr_porter .
negative	cheaper delivery , briliant customer service and efficient deliery and excellent packaging .
negative	advertising stated free delivery on orders over £_00 .
negative	this was not the case and in fact the policy had changed to £_000 ( something i did not know until i was in the final stages of the order ).
negative	i still am receiving emails stating £_00 for free delivery so they have not updated marketing despite drawing their attention to this !
negative	this appears to be a ploy to attact customers .
negative	i contacted customer_services on the above matters and had to wait for days for a response .
negative	they did not answer my questions sufficiently and each time i had to submit a comment through the website as_opposed to replying to the email i received ( since this is not allowed ).
negative	each time i submitted a message i had to wait a long time for a response .
negative	shocking customer experience .
negative	i was compensated with only 00 eur on my next order ...
negative	i am not even sure i want to use them again .
negative	not sufficient to entice my custom and i did expect delivery charge to be actually refunded .
negative	yodel has no_problems leaving packages in my back garden when no one is at home , which is usually the case .
negative	this was very welcome until they left a large item they damaged in transit that way .
negative	the damage was * very * visible , and yet they left it instead of taking it back .
negative	what '_s worse , they failed to pick it up afterwards , twice !
negative	i complained via a form on their website but never_heard back from them .
negative	bought several items from them without problems .
negative	used collect_+ whenever it was available and found it very convenient .
negative	where it '_s not available , very uses_yodel for deliveries .
negative	yodel always leaves my packages in my back garden when i am not at home , which was very welcome , until they left a large item they damaged in transit .
negative	the item was a set of window blinds plus a metal rail something like 0 . 0 meters long .
negative	in transit , the rail bent and its thick_cardboard shell was literally ripped apart at a point of impact .
negative	so , the damage was * very * visible , yet they left it in my garden in my absence , instead of taking it back .
negative	i explained the situation to very , attaching pictures of the damage , and asked if it '_s possible to send me just a replacement rail , as a rail itself isn_'_t that expensive , according to argos .
negative	they replied it '_s not possible and i will have to send the whole_thing back .
negative	i arranged a pick_up date and gave the instructions to pick it up from the back garden , as i wasn_'_t going to take a day off work , given a day of my time is more_expensive than the item they damaged .
negative	i also had to patch up the packaging , as bits would literally fall through the hole at the impact zone .
negative	guess_what ?
negative	they failed to pick it up !
negative	apparently my back garden is fine to leave a damaged item at , but not fine to pick it up from .
negative	i wrote back to very customer service and got a call back from a polite lady_who_apologised for the inconvenience , but the only thing she could offer was to arrange another pick_up .
negative	i mentioned i didn_'_t believe yodel would pick it up this time , but agreed .
negative	needless to say i was right - they failed to do so again .
negative	i wrote back to very customer service , but this time only got a generic " canned " response , suggesting me to arrange another pick_up .
negative	at this point i '_ve given up trying to return the item or get a refund .
negative	i will buy a replacement rail from argos and avoid both very and yodel like plague .
negative	as above speak to your managers !
negative	my prescription says sildenafil but your website only responds to viagra
negative	i find you ordering_process so difficult to follow - it takes me ages
negative	same goes for ordering dog dewormers !
negative	not user_friendly for an old timer !
negative	very prompt and efficient once order processed though ...
negative	sadly the item did not arrive on time .
negative	i ordered it on monday_morning .
negative	it said 0 working_days for postage so should have been here friday or saturday at the latest .
negative	it wasn_'_t .
negative	i went on holiday on the sunday without the pannier cover i had bought for the holiday .
negative	i had to buy another in a shop for twice the price .
negative	disappointed .
negative	read the reviews and stay clear .
negative	i would not spend a penny with a retailer that has so much out of date stock ( over a year to two years ).
negative	do not trust anything they say .
negative	do not part with any money .
negative	there is a problem with the online procurement system .
negative	it did not allow me to upload the prescription nor complete the sale online ( even without prescription ).
negative	this is the second occasion in 0 months that this has occurred
negative	ordered a spyder revelstoke jacket in the sale .
negative	advised low stock on website .
negative	heard_nothing so assumed order was okay .
negative	chased it a week_later to be advised that it was being held by the shop for a customer to try and if he didn_'_t want it i could have it .
negative	i would have to wait another week to find out .
negative	i tried to escalate it but got nowhere .
negative	the shop wouldn_'_t release it to the website guys .
negative	so you would rather prioritise a potential sale for someone to my firm order - amazing !
negative	then i receive this survey !
negative	even more unbelievable !
negative	i am still_waiting to hear if i can have the jacket .
negative	ordered 0mr 00days ago !!
negative	, poor custumer service
negative	as my car was off the road with a broken alternator , i was urgently requiring a replacement .
negative	i sourced one and paid extra money for next_day delivery through interlink_express .
negative	a text arrived confirming delivery between 00 . 00am and 0 . 00pm .
negative	when the part had not arrived by 0 . 00pm i went online and checked the tracking .
negative	interlink_express have been to my house several_times before but the tracking said that the address could not be found .
negative	no attempt had been made to phone me at any stage so i called the local_depot at plymouth .
negative	i was told that the driver was an agency driver and ' you know what they are like '.
negative	he would be coming_back later to deliver and has my telephone_number if there is a problem .
negative	when the part had still not arrived by 0 . 00pm i called again to be told that the part would definitely be delivered today .
negative	needless to say it is now past 0 . 00pm and no delivery or phone_call .
negative	far too late to fit an alternator outside anyway .
negative	i am out tomorrow so who_knows what will happen .
negative	the trader i bought from has_been informed of this failure and is very unhappy .
negative	it seems there have been other problems .
negative	poor service but much worse than that unprofessional behaviour and dishonesty .
negative	its a great idea , however when you have to start adding in this and adding in that , i start to wonder_why i paid so much for the hamper .
negative	it was meant to take the hassle out of calorie and portion_control , why not include things like rice or extra pasta to go with the dishes .
negative	the food_tastes good but after my second month i will not be having anymore .
negative	it appears that i am one of literally_hundreds of customers of iflorist who has paid them money to send flowers which either didn_'_t turn_up of weren_'_t as expected .
negative	i have ordered flowers for mother '_s day which should have turned_up over the weekend but still not arrived !
negative	they do not answer emails or telephone_calls and the next thing will be to visit them in person in burnley .
negative	can i encourage everyone who has had a bad_experience with this company to share their experience on as many on review sites , their twitter and facebook accounts in the hope that no more people are ripped_off by this company ??!
negative	!
negative	i '_m_sure the offers on non - tangible goods are ok but buying an actual product is a nightmare .
negative	really bad quality and poor after care .
negative	i never even got my money back on a watch that lasted a week .
negative	i '_m pretty sure they have no warehouse , stock or idea of how ecommerce works .
negative	stay clear if buying goods and you wont be disappointed .
negative	i will never buy from them again ..
negative	tilbudspriser er sat efter fiktive flaskepriser og derfor langt fra til at regne med .
negative	al markedsføring er ren trick - bl . a .
negative	udtryk som sidste chance som forekommer meget meget ofte , - og wupti : pludselig nogle uger efter er samme vin på tilbud igen .
negative	mystisk og minus tillidsvækkende ...
negative	stol ikke_på_deres trick - vinene kommer altid på tilbud igen .
negative	hav altid tålmodighed hvis der skal købes vin hos philipson wine .
negative	ordered some dvd '_s from amazon for next_day delivery on fri 00th_april .
negative	home delivery network website shows them checked in at 00 : 00 that evening .
negative	nothing since - it '_s now 0pm weds 0th .
negative	called their 00p_per min ' helpline ' - told that there is a problem .
negative	would not give me a date when i can expect to receive the items .
negative	completely rubbish company .
negative	i can '_t understand_why amazon would use such cowboys .
negative	i won_'_t be buying from amazon again till they get_rid .
negative	paid over £ 0000 for a cooker / hood / splashback , waited almost a week for confirmation of when the cooker would be in stock ( after being told i would get a call back the day after i had placed the order ).
negative	after calling the store myself to follow this up i then found it would be another week wait for them to get the cooker in stock .
negative	once in stock i had to call back again to arrange delivery / installation the following week , over 0_weeks after ordering and paying for the items .
negative	i took a day off work to be at home for the delivery and they then turned_up with the wrong cooker .
negative	not only that , but they hadn_'_t even ordered the correct model in the first place , so they didn_'_t have the correct replacement cooker in stock .
negative	when i spoke to the store to complain they made no effort to offer any sort of compensation for their mistake and in fact proceeded to tell me how their margins were already very low and they had lost money by delivering the wrong cooker and that i had already got a great deal etc_etc .
negative	not what a customer wants to hear , especially when all of this was the the fault of mark '_s electrical .
negative	my only option .. wait another 0_weeks for them to re - order / deliver / install the correct cooker , take another day off work and re - arrange the builders i had booked to come in and finish off our kitchen the same week .
negative	thanks very much marks_electrical .. meanwhile my money is sitting in their account and i have nothing to show for it .
negative	despite_being told that there was no way i would find another supplier with the cooker in stock and able to deliver in less_than 0_weeks , a few phone_calls later i found an_alternative company ( currys ) with the same model cooker in stock , available to deliver and install within a matter of days and it actually worked out cheaper_than marks_electrical including an extended 0 year_warranty !
negative	i accept that mistakes are made sometimes , but certainly didn_'_t expect the attitude i received or the lack of customer_care from a local company which , ultimately led to me taking my business elsewhere and finding a better deal .
neutral	when i protested and pointed_out the weight of the delivery was too low to have had all three taps they caved and advised they would be sending the third tap .
neutral	conclusion is product is ok but their paperwork / systems are weak
neutral	the toilets were out on both crossings , same boat six days_later
neutral	i am very pleased with the bag .
neutral	i paid an extra £_00 on top of the delivery but the couriers decided to split the delivery onto 0 vans so that they both got paid , i had to wait in for 0 box after the first three were delivered , i don_'_t believe the extra money i spent on delivery was worth having to wait in for 0 seperate ones .
neutral	i have bought a lot of things from the store and had good service hence us coming_back for more .
neutral	only problem this time was that i agreed with you that the item could be left in our garden and i would leave a tarpaulin out to cover it in the event of rain .
neutral	this was done because my wife and i work .
neutral	on the day of delivery my wife received calls from the delivery men saying they could not leave the item without a signature which is not what was agreed and this was explained on the phone by my wife .
neutral	they insisted we were there so we had to take time off work and dash home to sign for the item .
neutral	i would have made alternative_arrangements had i known
neutral	on purchasing the bass_guitar , the guitar itself was what i wanted and good value , however the included amplifier was not up to the job .
neutral	i was poorer than a low power guitar_amp purchased a long time ago .
neutral	delivery was perfect .
neutral	however i have never had h_&_c taps that turn on and off in opposite directions and i have worked in the hotel business .
neutral	fitted today so probably ok .
neutral	they look fantastic
neutral	fast delivery but quality was poor on quite a lot of images even_though the original was good quality taken with a good camera .
neutral	paid £_00 to keep a hard_copy of all our digital_photos over the years but some look shakey like the machine wasn_'_t calibrated correctly or something ?
neutral	i ordered a pair of trousers on the 0th_january , with a delivery time of 0 - 0 working_days .
neutral	however they were lost by the transport company , i found this out after ringing workwear_express on the 00th_jan .
neutral	admittedly workwear_express have said they would dispatch another pair if dpd cannot find them , however they said i would be waiting another week till the 00nd_jan . 0 - 0 working_days has now turned into 00 - 00 working_days .
neutral	car booked at milan malpensa .
neutral	my flight landed at terminal two .
neutral	but was told car was booked at terminal one .
neutral	caught bus to terminal one .
neutral	no car available because of strike action transferred 00 km to milan linate airport by taxi ( paid for but hire co ).
neutral	collected car from linate airport .
neutral	returned car as agreed to malpensa terminal one .
neutral	had to query charges made by hire co as there was an initial overcharge for rental .
neutral	however regardless of the above and where the fault laid the staff at malpensa were very helpful ( organizing the transfer to linate and adjusting the final invoice to the agreed_amount )
neutral	although i '_ve_used animed before , the last two orders have been stuffed_into an envelope and we all know that hm royal_mail don_'_t treat packages kindly .
neutral	what a shame .
neutral	the only problem i found was when i tried to get my voucher from your site it wasn_'_t available , then when i check my emails i have a message from booking . com with my voucher attached .
neutral	this i found very confusing .
neutral	now i get this email from you asking for my comments , please can you tell who am i dealing_with or are you one of the same ?
neutral	also the reference_numbers from you and booking . com are different again very confusing , because before i booked via alpha_rooms i had found the same apartment on booking . com site .
neutral	if you are all the same it would be nice to know .
neutral	i was very happy with the website and the prices .
neutral	delivery was very speedy which also pleased me .
neutral	my only_concern , and i guess it is an important one , the magnetic hook i purchased , with an alleged 0kg pull , slides down my fridge when a paper calendar is attached to it .
neutral	i have had to support it with a tiny kids magnet .
neutral	it has_been a touch disappointing , despite the positive customer service .
neutral	i turned_up in person needing a new tyre .
neutral	the price was beyond what i had with me .
neutral	returning home i went on the web and found the same tyre , fitted at the same location that i had just returned from available £_00 : 00 cheaper .
neutral	this seems to me to be a bizarre arrangement but i duly ordered the tyre and returned to have it fitted .
neutral	no tip .
neutral	had to call twice to get picked_up both_times person_who answered promised be there in 0 minute after 00_mins someone arrived , once that hurdle was over pick_up went smooth , arrived to drop_off car at 0 : 00 no one on site and factory worker said no one arrived until 0 : 00 wish we were told this at time off pick_up , nut once girl arrived we were sorted_out and taken to terminal very quickly .
neutral	so only issues was communication ,
neutral	one of the problems i have which is not unique is a neck size which is large 00 " and a body rather smaller so when i received the dinner shirt i ordered the body was massive but the collar fitted well .
neutral	as the shirt is usually under a suit or dinner_jacket i have not bothered sending it back but the ' niggle ' is there when i wear it .
neutral	the ordering was easy and the delivery at the expected time .
neutral	the packaging was a black polythene_bag with the shirt inside in a cellophane bag which had been ripped_open in order to put in a bow_tie i had also ordered .
neutral	it therefore looked scruffy , not what i expected and the overall experience was disappointing which was a pity as i am sure the firm are usually better and will also be disappointed with my comments
neutral	i have bought several items from superdry , and the choice and quality has_been good .
neutral	thus wish to buy more from the store , but after my last purchase , sizes in ' large ', ( my size ) are now coming up as a ' small ' and two items i have bought have been in ' xxlarge ' in order for me to fit into them .
neutral	i will be holding off purchases till stock issues and sizing have been corrected , or at_least become consistent .
neutral	and confidence in picking_up one items size will be the same as picking_up a second item in the same size .
neutral	i hope all will be corrected within the year as i have credit notes , due to mentioned items returned above , are not able to be refunded due to their returns_policy .
neutral	it would have been good to receive an email or two on build progress .
neutral	have used paypal for many_years .
neutral	very useful service but customer service is generally pretty bad .
neutral	they can also be a pain if you are a seller on ebay , with holding payments until they are satisfied you aren_'_t fraudulent .
neutral	innocent until proven guilty anyone ?
neutral	well it was good that my flowers turned_up and was ok to send next door . hopefully next time you could let the receiver address know they have flowers next door ? a little note as i sent a message to say have she received my present . she received a day later and the flowers where nice , which is a positive .
neutral	i ordered 0 packs at a specially reduced rate , but when they came i found i ' d been charged the full rate .
neutral	this seems to have been resolved after a phone_call .
neutral	my observation from the packaging from the item bought suggests this is a pre returned item possibly on one or more occasions .
neutral	not sure if the item is soiled as it also seems as though it has_been handled numerous_times .
neutral	i '_m reviewing the external_hard_drive enclosure designed to match the mac_mini .
neutral	the enclosure itself looks the business .
neutral	concerns : the enclosure it not the same footprint size as the mac_mini .
neutral	it is a few mm '_s out and is noticeable when stacked .
neutral	secondly , the internal fitments are very plasticky .
neutral	the tray you bolt the drive onto looks flimsy .
neutral	overall , i '_m glad i got it .
neutral	but it could be so much_better .
neutral	my recent order for several cables was delivered promptly and the packaging was excellent .
neutral	the products were good quality but i ordered a 0metre component video cable and i got a box that had 0 metres printed on the front .
neutral	unfortunately the cable inside was only 0 metre in length .
neutral	pity about that .
neutral	having made my order i was then informed that glasses i had ordered were no_longer instock and should not have been showing .
neutral	the only other glasses i like were £_00 - 00 more in cost of which i was somewhat unhappy having to pay full cost .
neutral	please ensure correct information is showing and not having to re - change order at extra costs .
neutral	si hughes
neutral	i purchaced my ankle_support direct from the website and paid £_00 . 00 and the £ 0 . 00 for delivery .
neutral	i later looked on ebay to find the same company was selling the same product for £ 0 . 00 with free delivery .
neutral	this is over half the price .
neutral	would buy again from this company but never from the main site .
neutral	don_'_t understand how they can do this .
neutral	not happy at all
neutral	why can '_t we have an old_fashioned quiet lounge ?
neutral	everyone very tired after night driving , we all just needed a little peace !!
neutral	!
neutral	the service is very good , but the speed of delivery leaves a lot to be desired .
neutral	i can get a box sent from the uk with a £ 0 . 00 delivery cost and receive it in 0 days .
neutral	a small_packet from chemist_direct 00 - 00 days , why
neutral	end is a brilliant website with a really good clothing range , it '_s just fedex that let it down for delivery , i would much prefer royal_mail were able to deliver it is much less hassle for redeliveries and picking_up parcels .
neutral	all their units are local to towns .
neutral	fedex the nearest office is about 00 miles_away from my home and cannot change delivery address for my convenience when working away .
neutral	i was attracted_by the amazon local voucher deals to purchase a conneisour hamper from serenata .
neutral	having had difficulty in closing the deal amazon gave_me a customer helpline telephone_number .
neutral	it took_ages to get a reply but eventually succeeded .
neutral	second_attempt was just as problematic and unfortunately lost the helpline number .
neutral	eventually succeeded using customer email , only to be advised they delivered flowers and not a hamper .
neutral	however it turned_out this was incorrect information as a hamper did get delivered .
neutral	not sure if i would use them again
neutral	this was a really good price to start with then less_than a week_later they knock another 0er off which is cool for the customer just not cool for me as i pre ordered it .
neutral	can '_t fault the bouquet which is good value for money and greatly_appreciated by my mum .
neutral	however , i had asked the delivery driver to be patient when delivering as my father is hard of hearing and my mother slow due to a recent hip operation .
neutral	the flowers were left on their pathway in full view of the road with happy birthday written on the box , and could easily have been taken before my parents realised they were outside .
neutral	the delivery driver had departed .
neutral	have been with vodafone for years , never bothered changing .
neutral	lately though it seems the network_coverage is not so great
neutral	and may look around for another_provider when my current
neutral	contract_expires .
neutral	always used to use expedia and still do but have been finding
neutral	cheaper hotels through people like alpharooms and travelrepublic .
neutral	expedia tend to give you a hotel_room without breakfast etc where
neutral	the other two for the same price tend to give you a room with breakfast
neutral	or half board , which can make a big_difference price wise .
neutral	where the price and meals offered are the same for all three then i
neutral	tend to book with expedia due to one click ordering .
neutral	overpriced , not very well made and easy to break when you refil , not like a real_cigarette , i am going to try patches next !
neutral	spoke to one of the well informed chaps about type of valley required and agreed best product to purchase went_ahead with purchase and awaited delivery .
neutral	this is where it came unstuck , the company supplying the products were late in delivering ro you , but you did not inform_me of this on top of which there were some dmages when goods arrived , which i had been informed about but was too late to do anything about it !
neutral	could have been better informed and at the stage where something could have been done about damaged goods or goods out of stock , and / or late deliveries !
neutral	!
neutral	topcashback offer reasonable deals across a range of companies .
neutral	however when a problem arises where cashback is wrong or does not track , they are not really interested in resolving the problem .
neutral	instead they hide_behind tracking speak 0 do not remove repeat offending suppliers , as presumably it affects their profits .
neutral	i bought my starter_pack of liberro reaslis in october_0000 and was very happy with the product .
neutral	however earlier this year i bought 0 replacement batteries , neither of which seemed work as well as the originals - in fact i returned one as i thought iy must be faulty , but it was then returned to me with a message that it " worked as expected ".
neutral	i have therefore persevered with the batteries but one has now died completely .
neutral	as the previous ones lasted over 0 years i am very disappointed and am looking for an_alternative product .
neutral	dog arrived , but unfortunately the pegs to secure to ground had not been sent .
neutral	i am still_waiting for a response to my email concerning these pegs .
neutral	the dog is great and looks great among the bushes in the garden
neutral	the axminster experience is otherwise good , but i returned the lathe for either an upgrade or whatever .
neutral	its been three_weeks now and not hearx a thing .
neutral	that says it all , for such a high postage for such a small item , would have expected overnight first_class post .
neutral	i love shopping at sigma , the guys usually have time for you , but the professional_manner and the quality if work is outstanding .
neutral	however , i can '_t understand how they can be understaffed on busy days , especially on the the service desk which is always the busiest part of the store .
neutral	the website is truly_awful now , i hate the drop menus which is a shame as the front page is so fresh and appealing .
neutral	secondly , why doesnt the reward_system give me my discount online , when i get it in store ?
neutral	i would prefer a reward card that could be swiped or a number that could input online like a tesco_club card .
neutral	wouldn_'_t this be a great marketing initiative as well as make it easier for staff and customers ?
neutral	you will never pay the advertised price .
neutral	when you go through the booking process the extras start adding up . get what you pay for and sometimes a bit less .
neutral	everything used to be in stock , but just recently many things i needed were not available .
neutral	in the past you could rely_on argos to have everything in stock .
neutral	would still use them though .
neutral	staff at local shop are very helpful .
neutral	i ordered the flowers through an amazon offer .
neutral	unfortunately the serenata web_page was simply unable to process this and just kept going back to the ordinary web_site and would not accept the amazon code .
neutral	i had to telephone and was dealt_with most courteously and efficiently by a serenata employee who arranged it all for me .
neutral	it would be best either to have a properly designated web_site or else instruct customers to process the order by telephone .
neutral	the flowers were delivered on time and were very well received " really beautiful and in a lovely_bouquet "
neutral	it was advertised as being for a pc or laptop .
neutral	i wanted it to use with my pc and assumed that it would be of normal size .
neutral	instead it was much smaller than the small one i use with my laptop so i had to switch them over .
neutral	read the other review and therefore made up my mind to go with company_formations 000 instead of the one my friend recommended me .
neutral	a bit disappointed to be honest .
neutral	check out was quick and easy , they first take money out therefore you have no way back .
neutral	afterward they will tell you what add - on you can purchase however you have already made the payment .
neutral	i first thought the " gold package " includes " registered office service " therefore they will forward the important document to me free of charge , but apparently when i fill in the details they ask if i want to use their redirect services otherwise my residential address will be shown as the services address .
neutral	i would like to point out that the intention for " registered office service " is to protect the director ( buyer ) home address however if the services address is made public and you have to pay extra to protect it .
neutral	it makes no sense to have a registered office address where the public can just find out where you live from the services address .
neutral	and this should be explained_clearly in the package page and also they should not take the payment until the final step .
neutral	other then that everything was smooth and solid hence the 0_star_review .
neutral	the fire was delivered in 0 parts by the same firm but on different days .
neutral	would be better if delivered together
neutral	staff helpful
neutral	having convinced us to try 0d ledger you never managed to get it working and we are now left with a server that errors when you log in .
neutral	we '_ve raised it with you and been promised you will sort it but you never do .
neutral	pcbuyit was communicative and helpful , and there was always someone sensible available by phone .
neutral	alas , their carrier , tnt in this case , let them and me down .
neutral	they did not deliver on the promised day , even_though i had paid for next - day delivery .
neutral	tnt said i could ask pcbuyit to get the delivery charge refunded , as some small compensation for the day - and - a - half i had to wait in at home .
neutral	i asked pcbuyit to take this up but they never got back to me .
neutral	see_above , use this service as we have not found a courier company that can deliver on time so best of a bad bunch .
neutral	i have ordered two items recently , which were small and of low_cost , but wex do not have a lower , less hassle , system for posting these items .
neutral	they are sent , to be signed for , with a minimum cost of £ 0 . 00 .
neutral	the item in this order cost £ 0 . 00 .
neutral	this is nonsense and i would not have ordered it from wex if i could have found the item with another supplier .
neutral	i order frequently from " premier - ink " as they have a reliable , eminently sensible system , for all their stock which costs £ 0 . 00 and is sent normal 0st .
neutral	class royal_mail and i always receive the items next_day .
neutral	a cheaper , quicker , simpler system than wex .
neutral	people said try trade_centre wales for a good car , so i did .
neutral	i was really impressed at first , very professional .
neutral	i picked the car that i fancied , a few scratches .
neutral	but was told they would be sorted , so i bought the .
neutral	pick_up day was to be saturday 00 - 0 - 0000 .
neutral	saturday came and excited_about picking_up the car , i arrived at trace centre wales at time we arranged .
neutral	all still going smooth , sorted_out the paperwork .
neutral	time to have the car .
neutral	checked it over and all looked good , until i got home and had a really good look .
neutral	to my shock i noticed dust everywhere .
neutral	the only reason for this i can think off that could cause so much mess .
neutral	was when they sanded down the paintwork , ready for spraying .
neutral	the windows must have been left open .
neutral	there was dust everywhere , thick in places .
neutral	it has taken me 0 / 0 a day to try and sort it out .
neutral	so everything_went well until the change over .
neutral	pity
neutral	amazon sent my an item , there system failed to pick_up i had cancelled minutes after_placing an order and had cancelled it for better model .
neutral	amazon want me to pay return postage and i '_ll have a battle trying to get a refund on postage .
neutral	you see if i don_'_t
neutral	paul allen , who may not use amazon again if i don_'_t get postage refunded
neutral	item appeared to be in stock until i ordered it .
neutral	does not reply to emails .
neutral	not sent until a month after ordering ( ordered on 00 jan , sent on 00 feb ).
neutral	however the item itself was new and in excellent condition as ordered .
neutral	having bought 0 tyres in august , i received a £_00 money - off voucher for my next order .
neutral	when i went to order my next 0 tyres the website did not recognise the code on my voucher .
neutral	i wonder_if i will be able to claim my next voucher ?
neutral	great service from the delivery team , amazing value product .
neutral	the only reservation i would have is that ao will phone you up before delivery takes place to sell you and extended_warranty scheme which would have cost me £ 0 a month .
neutral	you have the option to do this online , so why they feel the need to phone you up in respect of this was baffling .
neutral	after 00_minutes on the phone receiving a really hard_sell i managed to get the slimy toad off the phone .
neutral	apart_from the annoying sales_pitch for the warranty , which is where ao seems to be making approx 00_% of their profits from , i would buy from them again .
neutral	the service is perfect but the supplement i have received have only tow months till the expire date so its worrying me :)
neutral	your paying out system needs to be sorted for quicker payout .
neutral	the idea of waiting till midnight is a joke
neutral	hi , amigo_loans have a great concept here , but 0 of my friends have been off with me after asking them to guarantor and my one guarantor said he will never do it again , the questions are long and arduous and the guarantor is asked everything other than how many_times does he / she go to the toilet .
neutral	it '_s embarrassing enough needing a guarantor and this experience has left me with amigo '_s who aren_'_t really my amigo '_s ( i honestly don_'_t know why they would be offended by me asking , as i surely wouldn_'_t ) but that '_s my experience as asked for by amigo_loans .
neutral	i have the money and the terms are great .
neutral	great products but website crashed on me and products delivered to wrong place before being retrieved and sent back to me .
neutral	i didn_'_t receive my free_samples either
neutral	when booking a car , i requested a booster_seat and a satnav .
neutral	i thought i was paying for them when i checked out on rentcars . com .
neutral	when i got to the collection_point at the airport ( company called locauto ), i found the extras are paid for at the time of pickup .
neutral	unbelievably , the satnav was 00euros a day and the booster_seat 0euros a day .
neutral	it was cheaper for me to buy a satnav than to rent it for 0_weeks , so i purchased one at the airport .
neutral	there was also another fee to pay at the time of collection and the receptionist tried there best to sell you upgraded insurance .
neutral	overall , good value - but beware
neutral	the gate latch arrived very quickly but i paid extra for the fixing_screws which were not included ., i e_- mailed them but no reply .
neutral	i had a prefect_condition iphone_0s 00gb got quoted £_000 which was the best on the market but was emailed to say they had found scratches and a chip off a button
neutral	good job id tried to sell it on ebay earlier so i had all the photos to prove it was in prefect_condition a quick phone_call to zoom_fish and they honnored the original quote
neutral	i wonder_how many people just go sod it and except the £_000 re quote !
neutral	!
neutral	great place for a stag night !
neutral	my last order was actually a request for cr - v0 from the " rechargeable " list on the web_site but i received lithium non rechargeable_battery `_s . as the price was commensurate with these and as i needed them quickly i decided to accept them .
neutral	i will be more specific next time .
neutral	good delivery but immediately started sending adds with no unsubscribe facility .
neutral	this was a well made shower_door but i could not believe the plastic pivot points which will wear out in a couple of years .
neutral	i have fitted dozens of these from different_manufacturers many for less money , i '_m not convinced this is the best for the money .
neutral	i am keeping all the paperwork since i '_m_sure i will be making a claim on the lifetime_warranty .
neutral	had a groupon_voucher so decided to give them a try .
neutral	ordered two_pairs and was told they needed more details about my prescription .
neutral	but before i sent it i received one pair of glasses ??
neutral	sent back to check and second pair turned_up but were dirty with fingerprints on lenses and scratches on frames .
neutral	sent second pair back and after a week both_pairs turned_up .
neutral	quality was still not up to scratch and certainly not what i have ever received from high_street_opticians previously .
neutral	i will be extremely reluctant to use them again .
neutral	i have not received anything yet so it '_s difficult to say something about the medication i ordered .....
neutral	in new_york 0 days and we didn_'_t stop going to attractions .
neutral	we found that we were looking in the book to ensure that we at_least spent the amount it cost us to originally buy the pass . didn_'_t really enjoy any real time saving on the queuing system .
neutral	simple to navigate website and quite intuitive to work through .
neutral	simple navigation ( and helpful reminders in case you miss something !
neutral	).
neutral	unfortunately i couldn_'_t get my purchase to work on my ipad so had to reprocess it on my pc ( due to the online help being offline ...).
neutral	the car was clean , very low_mileage and in excellent condition .
neutral	it drove well and the customer_care on arrival and return was super .
neutral	unfortunately the handbrake stuck on during our hire , which was not the fault of the hire company - these things just happen .
neutral	thankfully on calling the aa this was able to be fixed promptly , but had it not we would have had to return to the hire company with the aa and picked_up another car rather_than a car being delivered to ourselves .
neutral	this would have caused us a 0 hour delay for an appointment we had , which we considered to be completely_unacceptable .
neutral	as i live in the area and want to support local business i would love to be able to write a glowing_review about my recent_trip but unfortunately
neutral	over priced drinks and cold food spoilt my trip .
neutral	female staff on the whole were pleasant and efficient unfortunately with a couple of exceptions most male staff gave the impression that they were trying to avoid serving the customers ,
neutral	unable to successfully receive an item i ordered
neutral	without a fault so ended_up ordering from alternate supplier
neutral	i used silver_shuttle for the first time , this week .
neutral	the service was reasonably_priced and the driver was there on time .
neutral	three concerns - the driver was on the phone when he picked me up ( which was rude ), he stayed on the phone all the way to the car , he then spoke on his mobile while driving ( as you know , this is a traffic offence and with good reason ).
neutral	i will try the service once more and if i see this type of behaviour again , i won_'_t continue .
neutral	a bit annoyed that the " pharmacist " wanted details on using product and using a box with airbags to deliver two boxes of pills was over the top , and using parcel_force to deliver is never ever good , they never can wait_until anyone answers the door .
neutral	all in all a bit_disappointing to get two packets of analgesics i could have got from boots or asda
neutral	the box seemed to have been walked on so i cannot blame the depot , potentially this was damaged by the courier that the blinds depot employed .
neutral	the head track ( pressed aluminum ) was buckled and bent , however i could bend it back .
neutral	it still isn_'_t straight however the kink is hidden by the pelmit .
neutral	this is a budget blind store , ideal for a rental house , however if it is for your long_term home , i suggest you look_elsewhere for better quality .
neutral	all in all it arrived quick , is a good " tie me over " product and relatively good value .
neutral	overall villa_plus were pretty good with very good staff .
neutral	we chose villa margarida in pria del oura portugal ( near albufera ).
neutral	the villa was good and just as_described , but if you value sleep , do not book it as across the road ( local house ) they have a very large dog which roams the garden all night , barking at anything for hours on end .
neutral	no sleep most nights if you are a normal sleeper or have kids .
neutral	w clark
neutral	york
neutral	found that it was a good shopping_experience . thing came promptly with no_problems .
neutral	delivery was texted in advance and then happened as expected .
neutral	i find using the website too_busy and you can '_t easily find what you want .
neutral	no more competitively_priced than sky .
neutral	broadband availability and speed is excellent .
neutral	tv and telephone is good .
neutral	could do more for existing_customers .
neutral	great prices .
neutral	very cheap .
neutral	however , my order took days to be dispatches and then days to be delivered so not happy about that .
neutral	i have used this service for about 00 months 0 parcels gone_missing out of approx 000
neutral	used to use basic service now only use signature deliveries which obviously costs more due to past experiences
neutral	overall good , customer service lacking though
neutral	so let_me start by saying that my product did arrive and it was in good condition .
neutral	however , the company took my payment as soon as i ordered and did not ship the product for 0 days !
neutral	after 0 days i was extremely concerned and had the same customer service rep telling_me " your product will arrive by friday ."
neutral	i didn_'_t see this possible .. on friday i checked again and to no surprise my product had not been shipped ..
neutral	i contacted them again and this time i finally received a different service rep !
neutral	he guaranteed my product will be there by monday , and it did arrive on monday .
neutral	i did not enjoy my experience with this company and will not be using them again .
neutral	i do not recommend this company .
neutral	fantastic just be nice to know when my goods are getting deliverd
neutral	my first experience with this company was quiete shocking .
neutral	when i arrived to their office i realiyed that i could get the car for the same price only if i want it without insurance .
neutral	seriously who would hire a car without insurance ?
neutral	so , of course i needed to pay than i booked the car .
neutral	except this everything was fine but is not a good attitude for a big company !
neutral	when you ' re paying ridiculous sums of money for articles that are 00 years old , i suppose efficiency is the least you should expect
neutral	we went to the shop and had excellent service and advice ... delivery was as stated with plenty of warning for the times etc
neutral	when two of the items were off loaded they were found with damaged packages , so marks were informed .
neutral	we are fitting these items in about 0 days so we will see if they are satisfactory .
neutral	if they are not damaged we will keep them and if they are we will see what marks after sales service recommend .... to be fare to them we have used them before .
neutral	so_far so good ..... update to follow
neutral	we needed a new lawnmower and , looking on the website , saw that there was 00_%_off flymo for the weekend only .
neutral	i went through the order procedure asking to collect in store , but saw that the price to pay was the full_amount .
neutral	i phoned the store and was told that the discount applied to on - line purchases and deliveries only , so i cancelled and ordered a home delivery , saving me money .
neutral	i would have thought that it would cost homebase more than the £ 0 . 00 charge to deliver the item - which i would have happily collected from store to get the item several days earlier .
neutral	it '_s a shame really , but this should be a 0 * review .
neutral	first_impressions are great and the samples that we ordered were quick and a true_reflection of the final product .
neutral	the order was then placed - two lengths of work top with a sink_cutout and some rounded_corners and two lengths of upstand .
neutral	so_far so good and the service was fast and efficient .
neutral	delivery was also well within the 0 - 00 working_days advertised ( 0 days ).
neutral	email sent the day before with the time window and the delivery team arrived as advertised .
neutral	and this is , sadly , where it goes_wrong .
neutral	upstands were bent - what a shame .
neutral	contacted worktop_express and after a bit of email to - ing and fro - ing , new upstand dispatched .
neutral	arrived 0 days_later - also bent !
neutral	this is no_longer fun and i '_ve lost money with the tiler not able to tiles the worktop walls .
neutral	replacements are , i '_m told , on the way and should be here in 00_hours time .
neutral	next comes the fitting of the sink .
neutral	now , there is a story here because the undermount sink manufacturer has a template on its website and this was sent to worktop_express .
neutral	the diagram sent for approval did not reflect the manufacture '_s cutout .
neutral	to cut the story_short , took workshop express advice on shape / size and agreed 0mm overhang .
neutral	cutout is nearly the right shape but mostly cut to the size of the sink .
neutral	i . e .
neutral	if i hadn_'_t asked for the overhang , the hole would have been too big for the sink .
neutral	not sure what / why it happened , but it shouldn_'_t have .
neutral	in summary , the product is great - a lovely oak full_stave worktop - but the attention to detail on the fabrication service and then the dispatch from the warehouse is not up to scratch .
neutral	thankfully , it '_s not terminal in my case .
neutral	dot the is and cross the ts on the order detail .
neutral	i purchase often online around the planet but first time with forzieri .
neutral	keen to get your sale .
neutral	i purchased a suede men '_s jacket & was duly told of a 0 week backorder .
neutral	i emailed twice but received no reply .
neutral	then 0_weeks_later received a shipped email with dhl .
neutral	0 days_later it arrived , beautify packaged .
neutral	and it is a quality garment superbly made , fits 000_%, is quality material & looks the part .
neutral	i would like to give 0_stars but can only give 0 ...
neutral	these days it has never been easier to communicate with anyone around the globe so there is absolutely no excuse for not replying to my email .
neutral	i will buy again but check on stock prior to pushing the buy button .... if possible to get such an answer ...!
neutral	busuu is great for meeting and getting to speak with natives of the language you are trying to learn .
neutral	i like the idea of natives and speakers of the language marking your exercises as you can get fast feedback but it '_s not always trustworthy .
neutral	i '_ve seen plenty of cases where someone has tried to correct an english exercise but the correction was riddled with errors .
neutral	this is not good for someone trying to learn the language .
neutral	they need to see almost perfect english / german / italian / whatever the language may be , if not it can be very easy to get confused .
neutral	everyone seems to correct exercises differently and a guideline for those marking exercises would be useful .
neutral	busuu lacks in one major area which is grammar lessons .
neutral	there are few explanations on the grammar and structure of sentences which is one of the main crucial areas of learning a language .
neutral	this is why i think busuu should only be used as an additional tool coincide with a language course or book and not a single learning resource .
neutral	it would be beneficial for busuu and it '_s users to concentrate on tackling the grammar issues to improve it '_s service .
neutral	i believe a lot of small improvements can be made but the it team ( if they use the site ) should be able to recognise most of these .
neutral	a new feature i would love to see is classrooms .
neutral	this is where users from the same native_language could enrol into a class that has a trusted community member ( s ) or a paid busuu staff_member that will help teach the class members .
neutral	this would be much more beneficial than trying to speak to another member to help with your chosen language that doesn_'_t know your own language .
neutral	people in the class can speak to one another and help one another progress .
neutral	you can proceed to the more advanced classes when the tutor believes you know enough to proceed and are consistent with using correct grammar and vocabulary within the unit .
neutral	this will help force more repetition and more learning rather_than writing a few poor sentences that get badly marked and then proceeding to the next unit without actually learning anything .
neutral	in summary_:
neutral	i believe busuu is a great place to make contacts with natives in the language you are wanting to learn which makes it a valuable resources .
neutral	without grammar lessons , as it stands busuu isn_'_t comprehensive enough to actually learn a language from using it alone .
neutral	there should be trusted community members or paid tutors to go over corrections to make_sure the student of the language is not being mislead by a correction .
neutral	i believe more support needs to be added for members to learn together and stay motivated .
neutral	not as nice as i was expecting but ok
neutral	the 00 mg tablet was not strong_enough
neutral	should i increase kit to 00 mg ?
neutral	yours_sincerely ,
neutral	j . mcculloch
neutral	hi , delivery a bit late lucky to find someone still there especially as it was a school .
neutral	it may be better to have less packaging and more flowers as the box was massive overkill and the flowers small in comparison size wise for what i could get at local flower shop ..
neutral	out of 00 .. 0 / 00 service 0 / 00 for product
neutral	my delivery was delayed twice .
neutral	and this prolonged the installation of the new bathroom
neutral	the car was great - clean and good quality - but £_00 a day for an additional driver was excessive on the cost of a week '_s hire and £ 0 a day for a booster cushion was a rip_off - we drove to the nearest tesco and bought one for £_00 .
neutral	the desk staff were patronising and seemed to be having a run in with everyone about additional_costs and hidden_charges .
neutral	after a mix_up in old address new address and i eventually received my glasses and they are excellent thank_you .
neutral	i will come ack for a third purchase soon .
neutral	john hughes
neutral	i bought a prs 000 - nice guitar , good muso salesman , satisfactory transaction .
neutral	when i got the guitar home i noticed that the tags and handbook did not match the guitar so asked gg if they could help .
neutral	they concluded that there had been a mixup in the storeroom where cases had got muddle and very quickly concluded that nothing could be done about it .
neutral	i '_m not impressed , the guitar cost a smidge under 0 grand and i don_'_t have set of matching tags and handbook to go with it .
neutral	nice guitar , shame about the lack of resolve to ensure the customer was satisfied .
neutral	great smooth service .
neutral	opted for the amazon gift_voucher option , when the voucher came through it was for less_than quoted without_any explanation
neutral	considering the low_prices paid for your cds this site is very ' choosy ' about what titles it will accept from you .
neutral	however they do seem to offer more per cd than some other_sites .
neutral	payment was sent ok but took a very long time to arrive .
neutral	i would recommend this service but would like to see the whole_process smoother & faster
neutral	na_een paar dagen contact opgenomen en ze waren vergeten de order door te sturen naar het magazijn iod .
neutral	daarna overigens snelle_levering .
neutral	i ordered magentic badges with logo and replaceable name insert .
neutral	build quality is good but print quality is relatively poor .
neutral	colours are a little washed out , and the white background i requested is more of cream colour , which means the white card insert makes the whole_thing look a little cheap .
neutral	i made an order 0nd_july on some shoes .
neutral	they werent in stock but were supposed to be shipped to golfstoreeurope within 0 - 0 days .
neutral	it has_gone 0 working_days and my order havent been shipped or taken_care of .
neutral	i ´_m waiting ...
neutral	i received your lighting package in a week , but on installation the four downlighters blew , one after the other , within the space of a week .
neutral	either they had been damaged in transit , or were old stock .
neutral	they have since all been replaced and the light fixtures are working as they should ( so_far ).
neutral	tooled_up '_s delivery company seems to be very good at sending text_messages saying they will be delivering the product during a 0 hour period , you wait in and then they do not turn_up .
neutral	then you get another text saying they attempted to deliver the product and you were not there !
neutral	complete nonsense .
neutral	this happended 0 times in all on two different products .
neutral	good : exterior facilities at villa , apart_from a broken parasol , which urgently needs_replacing .
neutral	not so good : villa rather closer to the busy_road than implied , and frequent continual barking of 0 dogs in adjacent property caused a fair_amount of disturbance .
neutral	kitchen rather shabby , with no facility for storage of non cold food .
neutral	villa_plus staff very helpful over flat battery on car , but no help at all in dealing_with a request to source an early flight home ( family problem ).
neutral	after telling us that seats were available if we called at the porto pollenca office it transpired that it is not possible to transfer flight_bookings .
neutral	staff should have been aware of this fact from the start .
neutral	it was the very first time i have sold a mobile_phone via the post .. so straight .. so soon .. so done and dusted .... i thought my phone was worth more ..... but the service is fabulous and quick .
neutral	spent £_000 . 00 on a brand_new casio_g_shock which arrived in december .
neutral	in january it stopped_working .
neutral	returned the watch to the watch_hut and after many weeks and me sending emails i was told it was being returned .
neutral	an email was sent to me saying " the watch had no fault but had been set_up wrong " three_weeks_later it stopped_working .
neutral	called again to be told that i could send it back again or call casio service team .
neutral	the service team were excellent but said that " setting the watch wrong " would not cause it to stop .
neutral	called the watch_hut asking for replacement or a refund and was told that i would need to send it back three_times !
neutral	in order for them to consider replacing the watch or refunding .
neutral	i '_ve had the watch six_months now and worn it a few_times at this rate a year will have passed until this is resolved .
neutral	not happy at all .
neutral	its costing me postage & packaging plus time to send this back .
neutral	i ordered my items as the internet shop stated that they were in stock , this in fact wasn_'_t the case .
neutral	although the store did contact me very quickly to advise me of this which was to their credit , it meant that i had to re - order the next_day from some where else , as i was on a tight_schedule this resulted_in a delay in receiving my goods in time for what they were intended .
neutral	hi i purchased an amp from guitarguitar , i had no_problems with this , i tried it in the shop and bought it there and then , job_done , great .
neutral	the problem i had was when i wanted to try a guitar , i had been told that to get a guitar from another shop you had to pay a deposit on the guitar before they would get it in for me to try , i am left_handed so understandably there was a small selection to choose from , being left_handed this is not unexpected , what was unexpected is that i saw a gretsch_guitar on their web_site , i rang my local_store in newcastle and asked if i could come in to the store to try it out , they said it was in their edinburgh store , i offered to pay the deposit to get it transferred down so i could try it .
neutral	i was told that the edinburgh store had lots of orders and they would not prioritise this .
neutral	they said the way to do it was to buy the guitar and return it for a full_refund within 0 days at my own_expense if i did not like it .
neutral	this is a poor policy , guitars are very individual and to personal taste you should always be able to try a guitar before buying it , i would expect guitar experts to know this .
neutral	as a result i purchased a £_000 gretsch_guitar from a competitor that would bring a guitar in from another store for me to try .
neutral	i contacted many properties with sunny rentals .
neutral	some replied , some didn_'_t .
neutral	their reply was quick and accurate but many replied in their own language which i found hard to communicate with .
neutral	overall i would try them again if i was looking to rent again .
neutral	the monitor i ordered is great and pcbuyit had it for the best price i could_find .
neutral	only problem i has was that i paid £_00 for a saturday delivery ( next_day ) but due a mix_up with their despatch it didn_'_t turn_up until mid next week .
neutral	they did refund the £_00 but in turn i missed half a days work waiting for it .
neutral	wouldn_'_t stop me shopping with them in the future though as customer service was very helpful .
neutral	the product is fine , ordered just one roll of repair_tape , which cost £ 0 . 00
neutral	however the postage for this one item cost £ 0 . 00 which i consider to be an extortionate figure .
neutral	they seem to have a fixed price for postage for small items despite what it really costs to post .
neutral	looks good but the proof is in the eating .
neutral	time will tell if it is as good as it appears to be .
neutral	i am very annoyed because a week after purchase the price was dropped by aprox
neutral	00_% i was going to buy a chest of draws and a coffee_table .
neutral	i will now explore other_outlets .
neutral	felt a 00hour delivery slot from 0am to 0pm is poor for a flower delivery service .
neutral	it should be closer to 0 hrs at most .
neutral	the flowers were of good quality and enough stems .
neutral	i was kept_informed of progress but dissappointed the flowers didnt_turn_up in the morning as this was supposed to be a surprise before my wife went to work
neutral	great quick service
neutral	very good when items are in stock , but not all items shown on website are in stock .
neutral	they claimed to have sent a commode that was not sent and was not available .
neutral	then they were unsure_about whether a refund and replacement were or were not being_processed .
neutral	i expect it will be sorted eventually ... but at what cost of time and energy !
neutral	the website and price were both good .
neutral	they sent the tyres for fitting at my local_national garage , but one of the four was a different tyre with a different tread .
neutral	i had to take it back for replacement .
neutral	the tyres were also marked with white oil - based paint and needed cleaning with white_spirit .
neutral	i do not know if national fitted the tyres sent to them or used some old tyres from their stock .
neutral	the manufacturing date is about two years_ago .
neutral	it will be a nice experience to fly with u guys
neutral	the ordering experience was fine and i was provided with a delivery estimate .
neutral	around the delivery estimate day , the delivery was made but i had no pre_- warning by email or phone_call or text_message .
neutral	how exactly could the delivery have been made if the lock on my oil_tank had not been busted ?
neutral	this has happened before .
neutral	a lot of wasted effort all_round only to find out that a product i ordered was not available .
neutral	i have given them the chance to try again .
neutral	.
neutral	.
neutral	.
neutral	i wonder what will happen ?
neutral	update > re - ordered material with expected availability in 0_weeks .
neutral	took them almost 0_weeks to post out stock that wouldve been in store .
neutral	only posted items once i made contact to query delivery but was provided no explanation , i think they overlooked my internet order , was pleased with order once i eventually received it
neutral	i recently_purchased what you advertised as genuine_hp_inks but after installing them my computer keeps alerting_me to say that one cartridge is not a genuine cartridge .
neutral	how can this happen
neutral	really pleased with the goods i got - just one item was not the same as the website picture and had to be returned .
neutral	disappointing but looks_like an earlier version of the shorts with the same name - diesel '_s fault for naming everything the same - or someone has photographed the wrong shorts - not a great loss overall i suppose
neutral	when it comes to physical items that are sent by mail , paypal continues to be my first service .
neutral	when it is about virtual items ( in game items etc .
neutral	), paypal seems to regret to support a dispute .
neutral	this means the seller can easily get away with my money , without delivering anything and with paypal not able to take any meaningful action .
neutral	i bought 0 electrics as i call them i put them on to charge up and 0 of them would not work so i willnot get anymore thank_you .
neutral	i have ordered much over the years and will again , but i am miffed that i ordered a guitar for next_day delivery , and then tracked the order to find it will arrive in two_weeks .
neutral	i have had other issues with late or never arriving gibson guitars .
neutral	item packaged securely and photographed , bubble_wrap , card separators and tape , however items inside must have been shaken about so much that and internal structure bent and came lose , had message from buyer complaining_about this , awaiting what he wants to do .
neutral	i expect same day email response .
neutral	is it too harsh ?
neutral	order was lost in post .
neutral	replacement sent out next_day delivery , minus one item out of stock which was refunded .
neutral	maybe time to use a better delivery service ?
neutral	our son was very much looking_forward to receiving his new superdry jacket for christmas .
neutral	small size ordered on - line but it wasn_'_t until he tried it on on christmas day that it appeared a bit ' roomy ' and then we noticed that on the inside label was a large letter l which we figured out stood for large .
neutral	so that he wasn_'_t to be disappointed for longer_than necessary we ( that is he and his dad - me ) took the 00 mile or so drive to our nearest superdry shop in cardiff ( plus car parking charge ) and changed the jacket in store for him .
neutral	the several staff in the shop who assisted us were so sorry for the experience that we had had and were extremely_helpful with our need and are a credit to the company .
neutral	we were just a bit unlucky .
neutral	perhaps due to the business of christmas that the wrong item was selected for delivery .
neutral	he is however very happy now with his new jacket and the experience is pretty_much forgotten .
neutral	first quote using the martin_lewis weblink showed a cost of £_00 . 00 .
neutral	however , when logged_into their system price was £_00 . 00 .
neutral	i re - run the email and log - in process to get the same result .
neutral	overall price paid was still reasonable .
neutral	check prior to . buying !
neutral	!
neutral	ordering was easy and delivery wast timely , unfortunately when the boxes we ordered arrived a number of the lids were cracked / broken , no doubt this occured in transit .
neutral	its got everything you need but the ui isnt very good and it takes 0 days for it to get here ( sweden )
neutral	problème avec mondial relay , avec_le point de_livraison fermé 0_jours de suite alors qu ' il aurait du etre ouvert , et_le 0e jour j ' y suis allé pour rien car ils ne retrouvaient pas le_colis alors qu ' il était bien livré ( enregistré a mon prenom au lieu de_mon nom ).
neutral	finalement je le recupere au bout de_mon 0e deplacements .
neutral	cependant tres_bon suivi_de probikeshop qui a fait forcing aupres de mondial relay pour trouver l ' erreur d ' enregistrement .
neutral	dommage que vos partenaires ne soient pas a la hauteur de_votre serieux , il ne faudrait pas que ca nuise a votre image ...
neutral	easy to book with , but when we had problems it was difficult to get hold of you , all we got was a lot of auto emails , would of been nice for you to call me and talk to a person .
neutral	we got a full_refund so thank_you very much for that .
neutral	for heavens sake cut out the amount of sign off and communication required from the customer - you will lose trade .
neutral	i would only expect to sign of my order requirements once - not every_step of the way .... this is your side to control not mine .
neutral	it was a simple process and easy and quick .
neutral	but i didn_'_t realise i ' d have to pay for postage i thought that part was free
neutral	service was ok .
neutral	the problem i had was that after exhausting available cars for that holiday_period , i found & booked an affordable car with vip_cars .
neutral	a day before leaving , i got a call from vip saying that the car is actually not available anymore ; & the only other option was another bigger car for almost double the price .
neutral	i was naturally quite put out by this as it was way above my budget .
neutral	sadly i could not find any other options through other_suppliers at that late stage - so i felt_like i was forced into this - as they knew i had no other solution .
neutral	so i paid double .
neutral	the car itself was generally good - though it did have a start - up problem - needing quite a bit of chugging on the key until it started .
neutral	i was also not informed about the r0000 extra deposit i had to leave on collection .
neutral	i then noticed an additional final fee deduction from my card a few_days after returning the car - without_any mention from them as to the reason_why ( the car was checked & there was no damage & the tank was returned full ).
neutral	overall i would say these_guys are ok for delivering a car - but they are certainly not shy of charging more / getting more money out of you than originally stated .
neutral	look for other fairer suppliers first - or even better - try deal directly with one of the rental_companies .
neutral	i felt that the quality of this product may have been a little stronger .
neutral	the first time i put it on the caravan and tightend the straps i ripped a strap away from its fastening .
neutral	yes i probably did apply too much pressure but i now have a three inch hole .
neutral	i placed the free material over the side windows as it tells you to but after 0_weeks i removed the cover only to find the roof light had small swirl marks where it had moved around slightly .
neutral	i probably wont be putting it back on .
neutral	ordered mugs on 0rd no mugs by the 0th .
neutral	phoned and was told someone would get back to me .
neutral	two hours_later no one phoned i phoned again to be told " we are waiting on the warehouse so i have nothing to tell you " where is the warehouse china no cant be i have had items delivered quicker from america .
neutral	will never use or recomend them .
neutral	facebook a good place to start !!!!!
neutral	have just had a phone_call from the sales_manager who i have to say was the total_opposite very polite and offered a full_refund plus free mugs so for this reason i will make it 0_stars and when all goes through will make more stars .
neutral	my order for a harris_tweed_jacket , placed on a saturday with the extra_cost of express delivery , was not received until ten days_later .
neutral	not good enough !
neutral	i have suggested to the company that they need to change their courier ( fed_ex ) so as to ensure that they meet their customer '_s expectations .
neutral	whether they will or not is another matter .
neutral	i have also verbally requested a refund of the express delivery charge with no result so_far .
neutral	however , following the above review , the manager contacted me almost_immediately and made an offer of a discounted refund which i have accepted .
neutral	he also advised that he will be taking - up the delivery delay with fed_ex .
neutral	the boots arrived promptly - the tracking service is very effective - but , very oddly , the boots were spattered by white mould and covered in what looked like watermarks .
neutral	the packaging showed no sign of water_damage so goodness_knows where the damp came from - even the lining and laces looked fine .
neutral	i nearly sent them back .
neutral	however , after i realised the marks largely could be removed with a damp cloth and a lot of rubbing , i did both and i ended_up with the boots i had hoped for .
neutral	they are fabulous - look great , comfortable , light_weight and exectkly the right size ( thanks to the measuring instructions ).
neutral	some good deals .
neutral	can be problematic with voucher redemption and not as good as [_external_reference_]
neutral	from the moment my initial phone_call was answered the service was as good as it gets , i wanted varivocals so had to send in an old pair , the envelope arrived two_days_later ( wonderful ), they returned to me a couple of days_later ( wonderful again ).
neutral	that was the last of the wonderfuls , it took between five and six_weeks to get the finished_article ( after a phone_call from myself wondering where they were , i think i could still be waiting if i hadn_'_t ).
neutral	i thought at one time the prescription would be out of date before i received the glasses .
neutral	i would love to recommend you to others but if this is your waiting times then i think i will decline .
neutral	the star_rating is the wrong system , the people on the phones deserve the full
neutral	0_stars , whoever is involve after that only deserve about 0 .
neutral	i was trying to book an mot online and found part of the website to be failing meaning i could not complete the booking .
neutral	as an it professional myself i am more than aware that these failures occur from time to time and cannot often be helped but i was disappointed by the fact that on asking the online advisor if he was able to find out a rough eta for the website to be back up due to the fact that i wished to use an online - only discount_voucher he was unable to help in any way other than suggesting that i restarted my internet_explorer session which coincidentally would have cut_off my chat_session without actually resolving a server issue at national_tyres end .
neutral	in service terms it makes very little sense to me to have an online advisor that cannot talk with other areas of the business .
neutral	i cannot currently think of any other questions i would refer to an online advisor for this company but if any come up i will be avoiding them .
neutral	that aside the website appeared to be restored the next_morning and i was able to book without issue and utilise my online voucher .
neutral	ordered online .
neutral	promised in 00_hrs .
neutral	usually they deliver as prom , ised .
neutral	however the ' agency driver ( sprint ) decided not to deliver for 00hrs !
neutral	what gripes is that he says he ' carded ' us .
neutral	that would be a miracle .
neutral	no letterbox & we were working outside all day & he never came close .
neutral	just shows how the lack of effort by one person could affect a whole company .
neutral	0_stars this time .
neutral	ordered the pump on friday_morning and it arrived monday .
neutral	it arrived in the actually pump box which was mis shaped , when i opened up the pump had been rolling around in the box due to cardboard holder in side being lose .
neutral	probably wouldn_'_t of happening if the box was packaged in another with bubble_wrap or something .
neutral	in this case the pump was ok but why risk it !
neutral	i was looking for a new hdmi_cable as i wanted to improve the picture on my tv .
neutral	after_reading on the website about the audioquest forest hdmi i thought great just what i need to improve my picture so i bought one .
neutral	when i received it a week_later , i tried it out and to be honest after_reading how good it was supposed to be i was really disappointed that it wasnt much different from the £ 0 hdmi i bought from the shop .
neutral	before buying an expensive cable decide_whether it really is worth so much more money just for such a minimal picture difference that you probably wouldnt notice anyway unless you stare at the screen long enough .
neutral	personally i wouldnt waste money on an overpriced cable again .
neutral	great added_bonus on fixed price items like travel - rail etc .
neutral	unable to compare as forced to make decision quickly otherewise cannot return .
neutral	must be able to compare net price after cashback with other comparison results - especially true of financial sector credit_cards insuraqnce etc .
neutral	( where payments are mush bigger )
neutral	thanks , i thought it was a great way to recycle old_mobile_phones and aid in making money .
neutral	hope to do more business with you !
neutral	this took a long time to be delivered .
neutral	companies should bot advertise items until they are assured that they can actually deliver rather_than just comment " out of stock ", and then make their customer wait .
neutral	first time i have ever felt the need to review a company - i ordered at 00 : 00 on friday so just missed the cut_off for next_day delievery ( which as i paid £_00 . 00 for my bracket im not to worried_about next_day ) bracket arrived in perfect order and fits my tv perfectly .
neutral	yes its wednesday so 0 full working_days since my order but as tilting brackets for 00 " tv '_s usually go for around £_000 ... who_cares ?
neutral	not exeptional service but by no means aweful .
neutral	maybe if i were a more anal person i would be concerned_about my tv bracket being a couple of days late .
neutral	it '_s cheap , it works , who_cares ?
neutral	the product was exactly_what i needed but express delivery was not express a fault of the delivery service used i believe .
neutral	i am_delighted with the amp but was disappointed after i had set it all up to find that it had a continental_plug on and i did not have the appropriate adapter .
neutral	very surprised that this should have been the case as its unusual to buy something in the uk with a european_plug on .
neutral	had to go to the travel section of the supermarket locally to get a uk to european adapter
neutral	we booked our meals before the journey but found them expensive for what we got , we had more drinks and when we asked to pay we were rudely spoken to and asked for our voucher for food they had already received this , there was some_confusion and about 00_mins later it was resolved .
neutral	expensive meal for what was there and staff very rude .
neutral	good selection and economic trophies , but £ 0 . 00 p_&_p on a £ 0 trophy is a rip_off .
neutral	delivery of 0 to 0 days is unacceptable in these days of next_day delivery .
neutral	very good !!!
neutral	but they messed_up the card when they printed " sender requires no message "
neutral	very disappointed , ordering was good and keeping_me up to date with my purchase was good .
neutral	but the flowers have died after only 0 days .
neutral	orderd a berghaus gilet for my wifes christmas_present .
neutral	came through fine but zipp broke after only a couple of uses , not what you expect from a brand like berhaus . had to send it back for repair ( which cost me ) , so overall not the best , but not all the fault of the retailer .
neutral	ordered twilight delux flowers for mother '_s day .
neutral	flowers came promptly but condition of the flowers were not as expected .
neutral	they have only lasted a couple of days and some were already dead on arrival .
neutral	this is the second time i '_ve_used your service and i was very happy the first time round .
neutral	don_'_t expect an easy ride .
neutral	product gets dumped at the kerb on a pallet .
neutral	first thing the driver said was that he can '_t even go over the kerb .
neutral	i expected some lifting but i also expected a delivery driver with the right equipment for a product like this so at_least the pallet could have gone to my back door
neutral	did not arrive first time i left it over week before making contact after 0 emalls the replacement arrived 0days after last email so 0_stars
neutral	bought a black & silver pen & decided to have it engraved - when it arrived the engraving was in gold - phoned up to say not happy & was told i should have checked the small_print seems it happens a lot !
neutral	!
neutral	tried for first time since had an offer from another company .
neutral	good service and marketing , but whilst smoked_salmon was excellent , lamb reasonable , the steak was at best average .
neutral	would have expected all three to have great taste .
neutral	would not return if this is indicative .
neutral	the order was delivered quite quickly .
neutral	its arrival was a bit of a surprise as we hadn_'_t received notification that it had been dispatched .
neutral	the outer_box , the panasonic box and the polystyrene packaging within were all damaged on one corner - it looked as though the complete parcel had been dropped on its corner .
neutral	the microwave itself seemed to be undamaged and the packaging had done its job .
neutral	also , the machine seemed to work ok after a brief test .
neutral	time will tell .
neutral	i will e_- mail prc_direct customer_services drawing their attention to what had happened together with some photos of the parcel .
neutral	first time i have been disappointed really , the service is normally excellent .
neutral	as always i was kept_fully upto_date with the status of the order , and whislt i had to ait some time for one item to arrive in stock this is not a problem .
neutral	it did however take longer_than the advice given and then the offending article did not fit , even_though from the same range as another pair of nike shorts which fitted_perfectly .
neutral	there are some small discrepencies in design so maybe they are indeed the wrong product .
neutral	i buy on line because it is very convenient given i live and work abroad .
neutral	i normaly buy with confidence as i know my size in particular brands .
neutral	i wont send them back as i dont have time and it is a considerable hassle and will eventually just discuard the shorts
neutral	ordered and paid for two items from kitchen_appliance , had to wait over three_weeks for delivery , for a internet company far to long .
neutral	great really - trusted and honest - just wish the postage was either free or at_least cheaper , if only ordering small items its often twice what you '_ll pay in the local_chemist
neutral	placed an order online for home delivery web said delivery within 0 days .
neutral	i sent an email to customer service on the second day as could not understand the message on
neutral	web_site it took 0 days for them to reply when they told me the items where awaiting stock at the warehouse which had now arrived and delivery would be within another 0 days .
neutral	i asked them why i was not informed of this when the order was placed or an email to explain the delay .
neutral	they did in the end refund my delivery charge as a gesture of goodwill .
neutral	so if you place an order with homebase you have to do all the chasing .
neutral	the delivery eventually turned_up 0 days late so all i am saying is keep us informed .
neutral	we were not expecting the to have to put_together the sofa and chair at no point were we told that they come flat_pack some people would not be able to manage the assembly or packaging and amount of cardboard , it states that all returns should be in the delivery boxes but how could people store the stuff it filled my estate car .
neutral	over all the quality was good value and the cupboards were great but pensioners older than us or disabled people should be advised by showroom staff that assembly is required and not suitable for some people why cant they be delivered assembled like other_companies .
neutral	happy with price but to many broken_tiles
neutral	i '_ve been using american sweets (_aka the stateside candy co .) for quite some time now and i '_m sorry to say my general feelings towards the company have become rather negative .
neutral	the major_issue i have with the company is that almost every time i place an order i find that when i open my parcel there are multiple items missing as they , according to the company , have become out - of - stock ( or in some circumstances were found broken in the warehouse ) since placing the order .
neutral	they seriously need to look in to how they can improve their ordering system as it '_s quite disgusting paying £ 0 . 00 for delivery of a parcel with at_least 00_% of it '_s expected contents missing .
neutral	next in line is that the price of clearance items can drop quite sudden and dramatically , and i have contacted them about this before after i placed an order only to find that three items had been reduced in price by 00_% overnight .
neutral	their response was simply " your parcel has_been dispatched and therefore we can amend any prices ".
neutral	finally their customer service skills are lacking somewhat .
neutral	i '_ve contacted them several_times over the year and the tone of the e_- mails ( usually responded to by emma baker ) are rather abrupt , that is if they ' re not ignored completely .
neutral	from reading the reviews of this company by other customers , it seems that all have complaints of a similar nature , and i would highly advise the director to take these issues onboard if they wish to keep customers .
neutral	before i finish , i just remembered that on my last order which had items ' out - of - stock ', the items were refunded ( as i requested ) but the refund was issued by cash enclosed inside an envelope - which i think speaks_volumes about their professionalism , or lack of .
neutral	good priced product but was given a delivery schedule , waited all day but did ' nt show , text me next_day but i had to delay to day after , i think it was delivery firms fault
neutral	the item turned_up when stated but the case was damaged badly and had obviously been sent out like it .
neutral	i complained and a new one was sent out after the old one was returned .
neutral	ffx would have got full stars had it not tried to sell a damaged item !
neutral	the delivery man handed the box to her upside_down !
neutral	good end to a good delivery ... not the were all shook up and some damaged but a bit of tlc and they ' re fine now .
neutral	i got my coins my buy now was set at the amount i bought which was 000 , 000 coins it got bought and i only got exactly 000 , 000 coins
neutral	requested tree > 0 . 00m due to planning requirements as per tree preservation order , once planted only 0 . 0m and this was after ringing to confirm size was acceptable .
neutral	very disappointed has may have to remove tree if council complain
neutral	my recipient gave_me details , we paid and all seemed well .
neutral	later , when payment did not turn_up , recipient realised she ' d given me incorrect information for payment to m - pesa account .
neutral	we tried to stop it but were out of time , and the payment was finalized and so irreversible .
neutral	i accept this as an error on our part but having no direct experience of pay methods in the less developed economies it would be nice if world_remit gave a little info , and clarity on irreversibility on payment types we ' re not familiar with .
neutral	would make them excellent rather_than just good .
neutral	mazuma was fast in payment and reliable as they kept to their words of the agreed sum .
neutral	however slightly_disappointed with the price they offer are very low compared to other_companies .
neutral	suggest they review their price offers .
neutral	prices were competitive but the parcel was very wet and one of the flowers were broken .
neutral	not quite the effect i was looking for .
neutral	bit disappointed really .
neutral	great offers , always great selection of products .
neutral	i wish you knew a week in advance when a new promotion is coming , i always order then the next_day or 0 its on offer or i could of got 00_%_off .
neutral	really frustrating when you spend over £_000 and the next_day you could of got £_00 off .
neutral	i decided to give printing . com a try on printing some flyers in an effort to compare with my usual_supplier .
neutral	initially the price was around £_00 (£_000 total_cost ) more_expensive but with a cheaper and perhaps more appropriate paper the price came down to what i considered more acceptable .
neutral	i have had problems with communications with emails not being answered , no call_backs and being invoiced at the incorrect price with no apology .
neutral	i also received an email on the 0th of march saying that the flyers were being delivered within 0 day to the branch and then on the 00th of march i was advised by email that they would not be ready for collection until the 00th of march .
neutral	i hope that this review helps the printing . com bournemouth franchisee .
neutral	decided to fumigate a small caravan i just purchased .
neutral	there were small flying things and crawlers and i thought the mini fortefog would do the trick .
neutral	it didn_'_t .
neutral	0 hours after activation i re - entered the caravan expecting to see dead insects and crawlers but only found live ones who seemed un bothered with the very small_amount of smoke produced by this product .
neutral	the product didn_'_t produce enough smoke to fill my small caravan .
neutral	the company sent a replacement but no different results were obtained .
neutral	i can '_t recommend this product but the company were quick to respond .
neutral	while i like the service , price etc ...
neutral	i don_'_t like the fact they are selling games that aren_'_t meant to be sold in the uk ( says so on the back of the packaging of the game i brought ).
neutral	so , if you want to trade the game in you '_ll have difficulty .
neutral	with an item as large as this , it was slightly_annoying that it was delivered a day earlier_than originally advised .
neutral	the new delivery day was only advised on the morning of delivery and it was a little inconvenient as i had to arrange someone to sign for the item in my absence
neutral	so_far i have placed an order and made payment , i think i have done well so_far .
neutral	for the rest we shall see .
neutral	more stars when something has actually been done
neutral	.......... reliable delivery but records with frayed spines are disappointing
neutral	good for price , it did arrive with some of the top layer wood scuffed off .
neutral	the attention to detail was good .
neutral	overall very satisfied .
neutral	not enthusiastically welcomed and whole visit seemed more like an intrusion .
neutral	can '_t complain at the prices as they were very competitive
neutral	asked for a quick visual check of brake_discs and pads and also a cost of the replacements which was done .
neutral	work was quickly done but when i got home i noticed one of the wheel covers had not been re - fitted correctly .
neutral	this i did myself as i wasn_'_t prepared to use petrol to drive back to the shop to have them do what is a simple_task .
neutral	before you buy from curry check online you will get better price 000_%
neutral	i use paypal a lot they are really good untill you have a problem .
neutral	does nt matter whos fault is it you will end up on losing side
neutral	i recieved some payment in us dollor approx 000 i call them up and ask them if i can transfer they money into my us dollor bank_account as dollor because paypal rate was very bad so i told them transfer they money into my bank and let them do the conversion .
neutral	rep told me yes thats fine and sent the money ,
neutral	i went to the bank and guess_what they converted the money and sent ponds in my account i call them up and ask them i dont want you to convert so i was told not possible i said ok revers the transfer which they did .
neutral	but now i only have $_000 i call again and ask where is the rest and was told it was lost in conversion i ask if i can speak to the manager but that did nt really help they would nt admit it was there mistake and would give me any money back what a joke
neutral	so after 0 phone_calls couple of bank transer i was back to squar one with a lost of $_00
neutral	chain used to have great prices with super slick delivery !
neutral	not anymore the deliveries have slowed right down and the prices are so so .
neutral	ribble have stolen the lead now with cheaper pricing and a quicker delivery .
neutral	chain have just lost the plot :-(
neutral	my parcel arrived after 00_hours . excellent delivery but the tracking said it was still in the wharehouse in tamworth . i wasted a lot of time on the phone and online . a manager rang to apologise for losing my parcel 00_hours after delivery and i signed for it on the drivers scanner .
neutral	website is not too easy to navigate , but the ordering is relatively simple .
neutral	there were no updates emailed out with the progress of the order , it was necessary to keep checking the website .
neutral	item was posted out the day before the final " expected delivery day " and then took several days to arrive via_ups .
neutral	the packaging looked like it had been trampled on .
neutral	i got my order , i '_m pretty happy with it , but it took a long time and a bit more hassle on my part than i tend to have with other online stores .
neutral	i ordered two items on line , they arrived quickly , but one item was wrong .
neutral	i contacted them and spoke to someone_who double_checked my order and believes someone picked the wrong item , he said he would sort it out and give me a call back , i passed my telephone_number to him then waited after waiting for over 0 hours , got fed_up , phoned back and spoke to someone_else who sorted it out in a few minutes , correct item now being dispatched .
neutral	if wae has a fault its the waiting time for delivery of an item i ordered an item on the 00th_march and wont receive it till probably the 00th ten days i accept it would take a couple of days for my credit_card to clear i am not crititising the company as such its just amount of time you have to wait .
neutral	the joy of getting the item is gone by the time you get the item
neutral	i have two holidays with this company and the first one was a breeze .
neutral	las_vegas trip worked out cheap compared to the deals i was getting during the time .
neutral	recently i booked two_days break for dublin and that experience was interesting .
neutral	i checked the details online and was about to book online .
neutral	as we were a party of six i decided to call up the call_centre .
neutral	i got through to an overseas call_centre and managed to find the deal i was looking for .
neutral	i explained to the agent that we were a party of 0 and the money will be paid on two cards .
neutral	i admit that agent was very accommodating and explained the first card payment will be 00_% of the total and the second will be 00 %.
neutral	i informed her that i am not happy with this and she agreed that it will be fine to pay for 0 people on one card and 0 on the other .
neutral	all prices and flight times were agreed and booking continued .
neutral	when it came to processing payment whatever i explained about paying for 0 people on one card went out of the window .
neutral	she quoted 00_% of the charge .
neutral	as we were back to square one i explained what i wanted again .
neutral	agent informed me that it should be done as 0 booking .
neutral	once the second booking was created we carried on with the payment .
neutral	before processing the payment the agent informed me the amount she will be deducting of the card and asked my permission .
neutral	i agreed as everything was correct .
neutral	i was waiting for the first payment to be processed she came back on the phone and informed me that the prices have gone up .
neutral	i was a bit_confused and questioned it .
neutral	the agent informed me that she works on a live system and prices can change .
neutral	i informed her that i am not happy about this as you were just about to take payment for a agreed_amount .
neutral	she informed me that there is nothing she can do and even a manager cant help .
neutral	i informed her that i was disappointed with the service but " i cant do anything was the reply ".
neutral	i was not happy about this so i decided to book it via expedia website .
neutral	i found that the rates were the same as before and nothing different .
neutral	while entering the details of the passenger i noticed that the agent had spelt one of the passengers name wrong which i was not happy about as this would have coasted us more if it needed to be changed later .
neutral	i entered correct information and continued with the booking .
neutral	once the booking was at payment page .
neutral	the price changed and came to the amount agent mentioned on the phone .
neutral	i noticed that the difference in price was only £ 0 per person which the agent failed to mention .
neutral	on the positive_side we didn_'_t end up paying extra to change passenger spelling .
neutral	personally i feel that they should have adjusted the fluxuating rate after the price was agreed which would have been the real expedia experience ( they would have gained that additional 0_stars )
neutral	positive
neutral	easy to use website , good deals , no credit_card charge .
neutral	negative
neutral	overseas call_centre was a let_down both on quality and service .
neutral	rates can fluxuate so until last_minute you wont know how much you are paying .
neutral	quick service but web_site seems to take ages to load pages .
neutral	delivered quickly but no invoice so have to chase up which takes time .
neutral	we bought a brand_new nissan_note tekna from chorley_nissan blackpool on the 0nd june .
neutral	the car had been brought through from chorley , but didn_'_t have a 0nd key or a users manaual , was assure that these would follw in a couple of days - waited_until the following weekend , contacted them again was assured that the items were on the way and should be at blackpool on monday 0th again nothing forthing and no explaination as to why .
neutral	spokre with chorley_nissan again on either monday or tuesday ( 00th or 00th ) was there was no trace of the key !!!!!
neutral	but they were ordering a new one .... they would phone my wife today ( thursday ) to arrange a time for her to collect the key its now 0000 and nothing !!!!!
neutral	!, this is the 0rd car we have bought from chorley_nissan - think it will be the last ,,,, very shoddy after sales service ,,, they have got the sale and they seem to have forgotten about us !!!!!
neutral	!
neutral	they changed my flight time twice by half an_hour so we had to change our transfers which was non - refundable .
neutral	however the prices are so cheap you can expect something bad to happen .
neutral	you pay for what you get !
neutral	purchased a laptop at £ 0000 , that already had £_000 off , then got another £_000 discount , very happy with that .
neutral	however after buying and during the process being told the only available delivery date was 00th_sept ( ordered on 00th_sept ) the confirmation_email then gave a delivery date of the 00th_oct ... nearly a month away .
neutral	customer_services were useless and completely unable to help in any way whatsoever .... was it a good deal ... who_knows ...
neutral	i just booked my car in at an airpark near manchester_airport and after booking i was a bit hacked_off to get a discount_voucher emailed to me the following_day which offered me cheaper parking than i had already paid !
neutral	couple of things to look out for though ; when booking online some extras are automatically_added on and it '_s up to you to delete them !
neutral	i missed the one about receiving an sms_message and was charged £ 0 . 00p for something i don_'_t want .
neutral	furthermore i didn_'_t notice that this particular carpark is un - manned and you have to take your keys with you .
neutral	don_'_t know about you but i kinda like to leave the keys with someone so at_least i know where they are and it '_s something less to misplace and remember !
neutral	but , the main point is that they accept no responsibility whatsoever for your vehicle and that is a concern for me .
neutral	from what i have since read it would appear that this is nothing more than a basic carpark with everyone driving around trying to find a space .
neutral	should have paid more attention and parked in a manned carpark where they take your car and park it then you jump in their shuttle_bus and are taken to the airport rather_than looking for a bus_stop and waiting for a bus .
neutral	i prefer the manned option as there '_s some peace of mind_knowing that it '_s staffed 00hrs a day .
neutral	big error on my part and i can '_t change it or i '_ll lose money .
neutral	we '_ll review when we return but probably_won_'_t use this again for the reasons stated .
neutral	finally it '_s a bit_annoying when you receive a discount_voucher offering cheaper parking 0 day after booking !
neutral	to be honest if you get 00 / 00 vision from laser_eye_surgery than brilliant but sadly i did not , though i still have to keep paying for another 0 years on a service that was not completed !
neutral	i was told that it might not be perfect and its not .
neutral	all the staff were amazing and very friendly , sadly though once it was all over and the surgeon said no to a touch up laser i was left in the dark , no options given or offered .
neutral	i just did not get out of it what i wanted - great 00 / 00 vision .
neutral	if you have a so - so prescription or lower_than go for it , if your eye_sight is relatively bad than give it a miss .
neutral	the site is cheap but delivery is slow as i '_ve had to email in the past chasing delivery and the last 0 deliveries were torn_open .
neutral	00m ethernet_cable arrived quickly , was well_packaged but i ordered white and the actual colour is closer to grey than white .
neutral	the gloves were a good product but at first i didn_'_t like them as they didnt seem as padded as they were shown to be but i '_ve realised they are quite padded now but i '_m yet to use them as i '_m saving them for when my season_starts again
neutral	when i had to collect the flowers from the dpd depot the box was half opened and crushed .
neutral	it looked ok inside , but the box was damp , boarding on cardboard mush .
neutral	after taking the flowers out at home the petals on some stems were damaged .
neutral	needed so attention to display .
neutral	dpd didn_'_t even say sorry for the damaged box .
neutral	they just tried to hide it be placing the box on the floor with the good side showing .
neutral	in all not a good experience .
neutral	very straightforward intuitive website with a logical order process .
neutral	all went well until i got to the payment page when the confirmation page froze so i was unsure_whether i ' d paid , or paid more than once .
neutral	it took a phone_call to sort this out .
neutral	once that was done the products arrived in good time .
neutral	had to take it myself to depot after paying for pick_up from home , not really impressed
neutral	we waited for 00_minutes before being served at the collection desk at pisa_airport .
neutral	the staff were friendly though .
neutral	the car we were given was not as ordered and despite budget '_s protests , it was from a larger , and to us unsatisfactory , category .
neutral	we wanted a ford_galaxy ( 0_seater ) and got a much larger mercedes vito .
neutral	the vehicle had been filled with diesel but not cleaned .
neutral	the interior was dirty and there was rubbish in glove_box and storage places .
neutral	no one checked the existing damage with us .
neutral	however , we managed to spend a week in tuscany with this over - sized van despite it being very difficult to park and manoeuvre in small villages with narrow_streets .
neutral	we returned it in firenze where the staff were excellent .
neutral	i had to change the dates i was going on holiday ( an easyjet package ).
neutral	i made the change less_than 00hrs since paying and the brochure price for the new holiday was over £_000 cheaper yet they gave_me £_00 back , it would have been cheaper to go to the travel_agents , they tell me there would have been no charge for this , but how do you fight your corner properly at the end of a phone ( which by the way cost me over £ 0 )
neutral	buy same product from my local pizza house for a third of the price
neutral	check the reviews before you order , there are some really dodgy takeaways on my site
neutral	if you like to keep to the same stuff all the time then ok , but the variety is very minimal on the food side .
neutral	the fresh and frozen_food is costly .
neutral	the special non food items they get in are good value but be quick as they only sell a few .
neutral	but beware of network_coverage
neutral	i bought the xl protein and straight_away was taken_aback at the dampish appearance in texture of it .
neutral	it seems to stick to the measuring scoop .
neutral	but having mixed my first drink i can '_t fault either the mixing or the taste ( strawberry_cream ) and it mixed well with both milk and water .
neutral	is it doing what it '_s supposed to ??
neutral	too early to comment as i am only 0 days into a 0k tub .
neutral	the only thing i wax disappointed with was the delivery ... 0 days ??
neutral	shocking delivery especially as i paid £ 0 . 00 for the privilege , it was supposed to be with me in 0 days .
neutral	will i use this again ??
neutral	if it does the job it '_s supposed too i may consider it , but in all honesty , if they continue using dpd as their couriers ... i may stick to bodybuildingwarehouse ... yes it '_s more_expensive , but it '_s never late , always next_day delivery ...
neutral	ordering went really well , great service and kept me well informed .
neutral	i was let_down with the size if the bouquet .
neutral	also some flowers have wilted after 0 day !
neutral	!
neutral	not impressed at all with the flowers .
neutral	service was really good too .
neutral	this is the second time i have you flyerzone and compared to the print quality the first time around , the second time around it was poor - almost faded .
neutral	when i complained and offered to send two examples back , your technician got back to me quickly enough but said that the quality was in the suitable range .
neutral	quite_frankly i hesitate using the flyerzone again , which is a shame as service standards are high .
neutral	as a first - time customer i ordered a pine rocking chair but a children '_s school desk arrived .
neutral	told it was a warehouse error .
neutral	really !
neutral	waited in again for the correct delivery two_days_later and the rocking chair did arrive .
neutral	was pleased with the chair but not so happy that the delivery company could not take the desk as they had not been issued with any paperwork .
neutral	waited in for a third day and at last the desk was gone .
neutral	hope the person it was originally_intended for has got it by now .
neutral	this comment is down to the product i received .
neutral	there was no safe instructions on how to get the product from the box and thus i nearly damaged it along with my glass table !
neutral	the card looked great but the layout of what i wanted written inside was very poor which was a let_down .
neutral	my partner was very happy with the product and it has_been one of the highlights of christmas for her .
neutral	i then received an email with a very heart warming message from you that i then showed to my partner which i feel is very professional and something i '_ve not received from your competitors .
neutral	good work but for me the two points are what let things down a little .
neutral	kind_regards ,
neutral	michael_o ' farrell
neutral	they offered the best price for my old phone , and the reply paid_envelope arrived the next_day .
neutral	however it took a week from them confirming_receipt of my phone to the money being sent for payment .
neutral	delivery came very quickly ... no_complaints .
neutral	product ( longridge practice golf_club ), not so good .
neutral	feels a bit light and not as good as same at local driving / teaching centre .
neutral	ordered 000 business_cards with silver foil on one side .
neutral	got them sent to me 00 days_later printed without the foil , instead some odd purple grey colour .
neutral	very frustrating .
neutral	can '_t believe they can miss that ?
neutral	i got new ones printed and that took another 0 days to get .
neutral	don_'_t think the staff was very helpful or apologising enough for it .
neutral	the new ones looked good so were fairly happy in the end .
neutral	although they originally shipped the wrong item to me i found the team at power_tools uk friendly and helpful .
neutral	they corrected thier mistake quickly and without trouble .
neutral	just eat is okay if you know what food place you want to order from .
neutral	but when looking for something new to eat , it is very annoying looking for food .
neutral	firstly they should include caterogries and types of food that you can find for your taste .
neutral	instead of looking around in 0 - 0 outlets for specific foods such as grill food , indian , halal ....
neutral	the sites fine , took me a few mins to understand how to navigate around so i could sell my dvd , s .
neutral	if i was to be totally honest their are better sites that give a little_bit more for the same article and on the odd_occasion this site does pay more i '_m unable to make up a batch without having to loose out over the whole sale .
neutral	on the plus_side they do pay reasonably quickly and if you wish they will send back what they have rejected .
neutral	needed a new electric hob .
neutral	chose kitchen_appliance centre because of good reviews on this and other forums .
neutral	not the cheapest but companies offering a cheaper price had scathing comments on review sites .
neutral	placed order late wednesday_evening and fortunately i decided to print the invoice which gave_me an order number and estimated delivery of 0 - 0 days .
neutral	i got no e_- mail confirmation of the order which is why it was fortunate that i had printed the invoice .
neutral	didn_'_t want a 0 day delivery as there wasn_'_t going to be anybody at home to accept delivery so sent an e_- mail requesting that delivery be no earlier_than monday .
neutral	never got a reply .
neutral	the cost of the hob was put on my credit_card on friday .
neutral	still hadn_'_t received any communication at all by monday so phoned up .
neutral	was told that the hob had been depatched on friday and so should be with me shortly .
neutral	i suggested it would be a good idea if an e_- mail had been sent to confirm despatch and was told that their system showed that an e_- mail had been sent .
neutral	got an e_- mail on tuesday to say that the hob had been despatched !
neutral	a little while later i got a text from dpd to tell me that delivery would be wednesday with an option to text back to change it .
neutral	wednesday_morning got another text from dpd to tell me delivery would be 00 . 00 - 00 . 00 again with an option to change it .
neutral	delivery was at 00 . 00 so jolly good to dpd .
neutral	hob was extremely well_wrapped ( i '_ve never seen so much bubble_wrap !)
neutral	and looking at the actual box the hob was in i discovered that it had been despatched from the aeg hub on friday for delivery to kitchen_appliance centre on monday so kac had told me a little porky when i phoned up .
neutral	all - in - all an ok experience but it would have been an excellent experience if a little more communication had taken place .
neutral	kwell i was on sky ditched then , orderd a brand_new service from talktalk they took the existing line over issued me a new tt number which had a totaly different prefix as do virgin and sky mostly than local bt wholesale numbers , all went on all good on time , i signed_up to essentials and then added a boost for more data , then added mobile and international boosts in the next few weeks , i did notice my router was signal dropping i called got through to a call_centre in manilla in the phillapines but the guy was clear and understood him perfectly he did something on his side and changed my router frequency , problem sorted and from calling to ending it took 0 mins , 0_weeks_later i broke my router my fault i knocked it over so a call to talktalk i fessed up said it was my fault and to my suprise the lady i spoke to said to me thats fine we will replace it free , then she looked at my account and said the package you are on and boosts your paying too much and did me a deal of all deals upgraded my account to broadband plus with unlimited uk calls including 0000 0000 and got the 000 mobile mins now 0000 boost and the international deal all for £_00 . 00 a month no one can beat that , so months go by all good no_probs until one day i get a welcome call from talktalk for a random person i was like no im not him but i am on talktalk the lady was miffed as she says the numbers are predialed on her screen , we both laughed it off and thought nothing of it , then with in 00_hours getting messages off people asking why im not picking_up my land line i picked_up my phone theres a dialing tone all in order as it seems , i called my mobile then saga begins i seen the number on the caller display , it wasnt my number ,
neutral	this is now where talktalk starts to become a problem i had to call them repeatedly to resolve the issue as i twigged by asking in my flats as we live in a block of 00 it was a new person_who had recently_moved in , the openreach engineer had managed to swap our lines in the junction_box outside our flats , but try telling that to some one in manilla they basically couldnt digest the issue and also the same time i was waiting for a brightspark to install my youview never showed up , so by monday after ringing customer retentions kicking off demanding to end my contract again fobbed_off saying it takes 0 to 0 days for a manager to deal with a complaint , still stuck with someone_elses phone n bb service and they have mine , basically talktalk blaming open_reach so i finally get a call off open_reach this rude guy , when i told_him the issue he was saying thats not my job you need a home visit im an exchange engineer ring you provider and make an appointment , so im ready to tear my hair out not , so i finally rang talktalks head_office left my issue and complaints , then i get a guy call me to say he is from the dheif executives office and he is personally dealing_with my account , finally we got to the bottom of it , yes it was open reaches fault not directly talktalks but the issue is talktalk and openreach have a very poor communication system as the bt guy when he come to my house explained , the work blind with just a job number and no line or work info theese errors especially buildings with multipul lines going into the building sometimes the cant figure_out whos is whos because they just dont_know unless the number is given on the job sheet talktalk dont due to customer privacy but a huge ball ache for the engineer , after 00 days i was back up and running with my own service and i negotiated 0 months free service as a £_00 credit , so if you have any major issues ring talktalks head_office and ask to speak to the cheif executives office they are the powers who be , but on that note i am happy with what i have and when my sister moved_house and told her to get talktalk for the prices and deals shes never had an issue her self apart
neutral	apart_from that line switch blunder i never had no_problems
neutral	i have bought 0 mp0_players from these_guys .
neutral	all 0 have failed and had to go back for either a refund or replacement within 0 months of purchase .
neutral	am0 don_'_t make these they are only resellers , however i was not impressed .
neutral	also , they were less then helpful when my sony mp0 failed , they were not interested and said i had to return to sony direct .
neutral	after to speaking to sony , no not the case , so a bit of too and from there .
neutral	time of writing i returned my last one and went to argos instead .
neutral	i will never use admp0 again .
neutral	poor
neutral	why do they allow people to arrive late into the films ?
neutral	all doors should be locked as soon as the trailers finish , all of the uk i have had films interrupted by late comers .
neutral	also , why do people feel the urge to constantly graze throughout a film ???
neutral	00_mins of scoffing .
neutral	slowest queues in the world at food stall and to get tickets , even to collect your prebooked ...
neutral	0 / 00
neutral	there is a reason for this - often the products are substandard .
neutral	great place for wires and spare_parts , but not full blown products .
neutral	we faxed a prescription to you which got mislaid so we had to fax another one over by the time we received our order our dog had gone without her pain killer for over a week !
neutral	the order process through to delivery of the flowers was great , i can '_t fault that but when i asked my girlfreind when she received the flowers , she said the box was wet and there was little water left in the water pouch .
neutral	she_loved the flowers and they were beautiful but just a leaking bag let it down as she needed to find somewhere to put them in water whilst in work .
neutral	other than that issue 00 / 00
neutral	have used nature '_s best for a couple of years and they ' re generally pretty good .
neutral	second class deliveries are pretty slow and , i '_ve had one that didn_'_t arrive , so it '_s worth_paying the extra £ 0 for first_class delivery .
neutral	personally i think all deliveries should be first_class and it always irritates me that i '_m supposedly getting free delivery because i '_m spending more than £_00 only to be hit by , what is in effect , a delivery charge .
neutral	saying that though , the advice line is quite helpful
neutral	generally good quick dispatch for everything i '_ve bought , however when items are sent via hdnl there seems to be no end of problems .
neutral	excellent prices and ease of service from this website , i have used before but , although blackcircles part of the deal was excellent they have changed the tyre depot to use to get the tyres_fitted .
neutral	before it was spotless and efficient unfortunately this new depot was somewhat the opposite , very dirty employees and i had my son with me and the boss was communicating with a customer in hear shot swearing and generally not really bothered my young son was standing practically next to him , very unprofessional ..
neutral	so definately not using this depot again !!!
neutral	!
neutral	tyres , good make , great road holding but very very noisey , ten times worse than the michelins they replaced , so would not recommend them
neutral	lovely fabrics , unfriendly staff
neutral	nice flowers just not sure if they was worth £_00 plus delivery
neutral	why not just have a landline to order a part instead of a very expensive 0000 or 0000 number which i have to pay for and which is an additional_expense to the cost and postage cost of the part ?
neutral	a bit long_winded trying to find my product but once found ordering is easy .
neutral	second time i '_ve ordered on - line and both_times has taken 00days + for goods to arrive would only buy items on sale as much more_expensive than other on - line retailers
neutral	it '_s ok but everyday the offers come through and the offers are very poor
neutral	customer service could be much_better : i had my bike serviced 0 months_ago at the waterloo branch of evans_cycles .
neutral	i paid for lots of extras including a new chain set ( shimano m000 deore ), which included the peddle shafts .
neutral	having paid for lots of new stuff (£_000 worth ), they strangely didn_'_t ask if i wanted new peddles with the new chain set .
neutral	when i picked_up the bike , the last thing they did was screw the old peddles into the new chain set peddle shafts .
neutral	all was fine for 0 months when , all of a sudden , the right peddle became lose & fell_off .
neutral	the thread on the peddle socket had completely worn out !
neutral	after some discussion with customer_services email , they suggested i drop the bike off & they would enquire_about warranty from shimano .
neutral	i dropped the bike off at the guildford_branch on 00th apr .
neutral	i thought they ' d just replace the chainset and discuss the warranty with shimano separately .
neutral	after a couple of weeks shimano rejected the warranty claim however .
neutral	i discussed the next steps with the guildford_branch and they agreed to a £_00 discount on a new chainset ( now £_00 . 00 which originally cost me £_00 . 00 so i '_m effectively getting a £_00 discount ).
neutral	i suggested we install new pedals this time which i was happy to pay for (£_00 . 00 ).
neutral	so , after 0 - 0_weeks of inconvenience & £_00 . 00 , the issue is resolved .
neutral	the new chainset is costing me £_00 . 00 ( original ) + 00 . 00 = £_000 . 00
neutral	i suggested evans pay the full £_00 . 00 for the new chainset as they should have installed new pedals , but they have only agreed to a small discount for the time and inconvenience_caused .
neutral	not the best customer service , but we finally got there .
neutral	i would respect & trust evans much more if they took care of issues like this properly .
neutral	i ordered an epson v00 perfection scanner .
neutral	i '_m in the uk and they sent me an eu dc adapter , and also a uk_plug ( unwired ).
neutral	i asked what they expected me to do with the plug - if i wired that on the cable it would no_longer act as a dc adapter ( just ac ?!)
neutral	initially , pixmania apologised and sent they ' d send out a uk adapter .
neutral	then they sent another email_saying they couldn_'_t send the adapter but give a £ 0 refund if i returned the old adapter ( at whose cost ?)
neutral	all very inconvenient .
neutral	poor customer service .
neutral	in the end of the day , i as the customer have done nothing to deserve this treatment of being sent the wrong goods .
neutral	pixmania should ' make good ' when they send out the wrong items .
neutral	_____update____________________________________________
neutral	after some discussion with emma from pixmania support , she agreed to a £_00 refund for the inconvenience .
neutral	this is better customer service so i '_ve bumped my rating from 0 to 0_stars .
neutral	i don_'_t mind companies making mistakes as long as they try & rectify the issue .
neutral	now , i '_m off to buy a uk dc adapter ...
neutral	cardelmar found a good deal with avis .
neutral	they also changed my start day without too much hassle ( my flight went earlier_than_expected ).
neutral	problem : i opted for excess_cover on the cardelmar website but the payment for it failed ( although payment for car was ok ).
neutral	i therefore used another excess_insurance provider ( questor ).
neutral	however , when i arrived at avis they insisted i pay a £ 0000 deposit because i didn_'_t use their cover .
neutral	they ' d only accept on a credit_card but i only had a debit_card which they wouldn_'_t accept .
neutral	i was forced to take out avis '_s own cover @ £_00 / day !
neutral	avis covered everything but not the car key ( outrageous !
neutral	).
neutral	so , beware of the hire car company rules when you take out cover from other_companies like cardelmar / questor .
neutral	cardelmar should have made these issues clearer to me before my journey rather_than leave it to the small_print ; 0 \
neutral	no_frills service
neutral	get emails_telling_me it '_s left the same day and week_later no stuff
neutral	a good product , easily fitted with good instructions .
neutral	the web_site is easily_navigated and the ordering_process simple to follow .
neutral	the goods took over a week to arrive well within the up to 00 days the web_site suggested it could take due to the items coming from a depot in europe .
neutral	however i was exasperated to receive customer feedback / buying experience e_- mail after 0 days asking for a review when i had not yet received the goods ???????????.
neutral	this annoyed me as it would be " good practice " for this feedback request to go out to customers at a time when they are likely to have actually received the goods and had the proper time to appraise etc .
neutral	( customer_services please take_note !!!)
neutral	i posted a review in the heat of the moment and actually i think used the b word once suggesting it might be better to allow at_least the 00 days possible delivery before bombarding the customer with requests for buying feedback .
neutral	i also praised the company for the ease of ordering and the easy to navigate web_site but as they were so upset at the use of course language ( 0 b word ) they complained and had the post removed .
neutral	i hope the company reviews their feedback procedure in the future and allows the appropriate time to elapse before requesting such information .
neutral	i should also like to apologise for the use of a course word in my original review and state for the record that after spending £_000 . 00 on your company products i would use you again and would recommend your products .
neutral	pruducts are great delivery is mainly through herms they make you wait all day dont turn_up and say they tride to deliver , ei lie ,,,, i find this very terable buisness ,, i have had many products from discount supliments ,,,, havnt ordered for somtime just becuase of the delivery company is terable ,,, wish they would just do it by po or a delivery company that well give a time ie am or pm and turns_up , hermes does not give a time and lies they have tride to deliver when they have not or just not turn_up at all ,,
neutral	this has happenened with almost every order from discount_suppliments ,, ive not ordered for some time becuase of herms is crap sorry discount_suppliments , please change delivery firm ,, as you well loose buisness becuase of hermes yes its very cheap with them but their service is realy shit ,, with drivers underpaid ,,,, awfull .... ds product are great though ,,,,
neutral	fantastic fast service had 0 days to deliver the oil .
neutral	we could not do 0 day so added noted on the order .
neutral	i also phoned the contracted oil supplier to let them know .
neutral	they told me that they would call us the day before .
neutral	the oil was delivered the day my wife worked .
neutral	the delivery driver got through a padlocked gate and risked attack from our dog .
neutral	why .
neutral	from_start to finish took about 0 mins all very easy .
neutral	i forgot the password i normally use and because it was a work based e_mail address , i didn_'_t receive my new password when you sent it .
neutral	i fully appreciate this is because of security settings on my companies site however some type of link allowing me to let you know the problem and allowing me to send you an e_mail to a pre_- set address which would mean you were able to reply would be useful .
neutral	i can '_t be the only user with an over_zealous security wall attached to the e_mail address .
neutral	i got around this by using my home e_mail address however i only log on periodically so do everything through my work e_mail .
neutral	all went well until delivery arrived .
neutral	laminate had been stood on end and bounced_around damaging all the cortheners .
neutral	i ended_up making several journeys to 0 stores to collect 00 packs ( due to weight ).
neutral	if i wanted to wait for another attempt at delivery it would be another 0_weeks .
neutral	delivery firm need to take more care loading the lorry and homebase need to improve the online order customer service .
neutral	the help i received at the horsham branch was fantastic though .
neutral	i tried them because the coffee is inexpensive compared to proper nespresso .
neutral	however the taste is poor and the pods are really cheap and don_'_t seem to be solidly packed with coffee .
neutral	will be going back to nespresso .
neutral	a handful of years back you couldn_'_t beat them .
neutral	you would get identical products sold elsewhere for considerably more .
neutral	for example 0 . 0l diamond hard varnish £_00 . 00 vs £_00 in b_& q .
neutral	that was 0 - 00 years_ago .
neutral	when woolworths existed wilko prices were great .
neutral	once woolys went , all the wilko prices went up .
neutral	they are still cheaper on some things than the likes of tesco , but certainly not always any more , and you should check first .
neutral	i know of quite a few products sold by wilko that are cheaper_elsewhere - and that never used to happen .
neutral	a new store has opened near where i live , and that absolutely kicks wilko into touch .
neutral	my visits to wilkinson are a fraction of what they used to be .
neutral	higher prices ( price jumps of 00_% common ) staff arguing with you when items / food that is sitting in the reduced section scans as full price .
neutral	only last_week i had the supervisor arguing , only for her to be proved wrong when i proved that the items should have been reduced after all .
neutral	another story of getting carried away with yourself and biting the hand that feeds you ......
neutral	expect sign to be clear on back window of car , be able to read it and see through it .
neutral	i guess its my fault should of asked if it was clear vinyl .
neutral	sign reads great just can '_t see out of back window need a plan b
neutral	my initial experience of pipe e_- smoking was through a liberro product within a very short time my pipe cracked and virtually always leaked oil into the bowl .
neutral	when i questioned the product i was given " useful_tips " to prevent this happening but it is virtually_impossible to stop , thus decreasing the life expectancy of the product .
neutral	my replacement was given to me at a discount but still felt aggrieved .
neutral	i have since bought a second pipe from a different supplier which is easier to use , more realistic and much more of a pleasure to use .
neutral	i will not be rushing_back to liberro ..
neutral	when i placed the order , i was expecting 0 - 0 day delivery - what i hadn_'_t seen is that one item was on a long delivery - and that the whole order was being delayed by that item .
neutral	the order confirmation made no reference to the delay , and viewing the order on the website did not help .
neutral	i understand that not every item can be in stock all the time - but setting the customer expectation accurately when placing the order would save a lot of grief all_round .
neutral	great service and very fast delivery costume is as_described except it looks as though it has_been worn and returned !!!
neutral	don_'_t have time to return and replace though !
neutral	!
neutral	would have given 0_stars if it was not for that !
neutral	!
neutral	probably_won_'_t use escapade again tho !
neutral	!.
neutral	la situación del apartamento fué inmejorable , pero había demasiado ruido por la noche , la calle era demasiado transitada para nuestro gusto , aunque por_lo_que vimos creo que toda barcelona es igual .
neutral	the product arrived and i am pleased with 00_% but there are a few issues .
neutral	i think there may be an issue with the software as one page has no background when " apply to all pages " was selected .
neutral	two or three of the prints are very grainy and appear to be very red , not sure if this is because the software automatically sizes the pictures and difficult to see on laptop when creating book as you are not allowed to view the book at actual size .
neutral	good quality blinds at the right price plus good service with delivery .
neutral	item bought , works_fine and does what i need at a decent price
neutral	the booking experience was good but despite enquiries on delivery and promises of a dispatch date .
neutral	when the tickets had not arrived two_days before the concert - we had to fly to the event - we ended_up chasing the courier and had to collect from their office rather then have them delivered .
neutral	sadly this soured an otherwise pleasant_experience .
neutral	was a bit disappointed as i sent you 0 i phone 0 '_s and on the internet you only asked if the phones worked which they both did , but one had a crack on the screen and you reduced your offer to £_00 i think it is an insult , if you had asked if the phones were damaged i would have said about the crack but you don_'_t
neutral	we checked many companies on the internet looking for the best price for arden_grange light dog_food .
neutral	monster gave_us this .
neutral	their email order confirmaton also gave_us a delivery tracking_number .
neutral	on the day delivery was due , we tried to track it via computer but got the answer that the number was unknown .
neutral	we then phoned yodel ( their delivery agent ) and were told that it would be that day but could give us no estimate of time except - between 00 . 00 - 00 . 00 .
neutral	we waited in and there was no delivery .
neutral	it arrived next_day when we were out .
neutral	i have written to monster suggesting that they review their use of this delivery company .
neutral	they have written back apologising for the problem
neutral	i am being asked to rate the company when i have only just ordered the product .
neutral	it says that delivery is 0 to 0_weeks which i think is unacceptable in this day and age , but it is a present for someone_else which they really want ; otherwise i would have found an_alternative .
neutral	the other thing is that the delivery starts at £ 0 + which for an item of £_00 + is virtually 00_% and makes the whole point of buying online pretty worthless .
neutral	felt i was rushed through - surgery_itself was fine but the aftercare is shocking , unable to get my follow_up appointments despite_numerous_attempts so i gave up " the diary was always full post surgery " i wouldn_'_t recommend this company .
neutral	i bought a tow_bar .
neutral	after_reading the instructions and comparing it to my car i thought it might be the wrong one for my car .
neutral	it turns_out the rear_bumper needs to be totally removed , which was not shown in the instructions , nor where all the hidden clips are located .
neutral	i then needed to remove a metal bumper underneath , and then slide the towbar into the slot where the metal bumper was once fitted .
neutral	then i could see no mounting_holes , so i thought i would need to drill some .
neutral	it turns_out there is mounting_holes on the car , but they were covered up until i scraped the paint away .
neutral	i then wired up the lights as per quite good instructions , however the right indicator flashed the left lights and vice_versa .
neutral	in the instructions where it says " near side " it means the far ( passanger / left side not driver ) side .
neutral	it seems the instructions , though in english ) and intended for the usa or mainland_europe where the drivers_side is on the left .
neutral	the instructions should be fixed , especially when it is the same wiring instructions for every_single towbar and shipped from the uk !
neutral	probably no fault of the towbar makers , but the car designers , but it is a big job to remove the bumper , not having done it before .
neutral	i have installed 0 towbars sucesfully in the past to other vehicles , normally taking an_hour or two .
neutral	in all previous cases there was no need to remove the bumper .
neutral	this confusion with no or nearly no instructions took me 0 hours to fit the towbar , and about another 0 hours to get the lights working and put all the panels back .
neutral	the delivery was fast , the price was low , but the lack of any meaningful instructions , and the wrong wiring instructions added about 0 hours to the job .
neutral	i placed an order for a few shower parts by email on monday 0th_october and had conformation the same day .
neutral	however , as i had not received anything by friday 00th_october i phoned the spares department and after a discussion regarding the order number , the parts were dispatched and i received them next_day on saturday .
neutral	as the parts were dispatched the same day as the phone_call , i can only_assume the original email order was misplaced .
neutral	the only fault with their booking sy she is that after i paid with my card , i received an e_mail saying that the transaction did not go through despite receiving a confirmation .
neutral	therefore , i had to contact them to find out if it had gone though or not ant destroyed my confidence in their booking system .
neutral	the tickets i ordered arrived on time and with no_fuss .
neutral	but i was surprised to discover i had paid nearly_£_00 for tickets with a face value of only £_00 .
neutral	that is a big mark up and i was given no warning of this at point of purchase .
neutral	i suppose they have to make a mark up but that is going some !
neutral	it felt me and my colleagues who accompanied me feel_ripped_off .
neutral	need to update ship setup for motorcycles .
neutral	always use goodp [ rint but they have cut these strangely and so they don_'_t look right .
neutral	nice villa
neutral	cold pool due to continual cold_water top up via hose_pipe - defeats the object of me deliberately picking a villa with a heated small pool to allow use in autumn
neutral	i have found webtogs to offer an excellent service , however i find the shipping rates to ireland are prohibitively high - for example £_00 . 00 postage for a pair of socks !!!
neutral	( i would use webtogs much more regularly if a reasonable postage rate applied ).
neutral	the offers never seem to work for me , but other than that a good betting site
neutral	i ordered from toyella once and i feel like they ' re that awkward guy that you met once and now won_'_t leave you alone .
neutral	please go away , i am not your friend .
neutral	i tried to obtain the norton_000 offer proffered by total_computing by e_- mail but nearly despaired after attempting payment on three occasions ( each successfully and positively verified by my bank ) but failing to be accepted by total .
neutral	after telephone_call ( which suggested could not be used for payment ) i was talked through a procedure that managed to work and have now got the product - still to be installed .
neutral	would thoroughly_recommend pay_pal for transactions - it is far and away less_painful !
neutral	the bookcase was fine and no_complaints about the quality and price .
neutral	however , the flood of texts and e_- mails about the delivery were just overwhelming ; they were also rather ' unfriendly ' in that i was being told to make_sure that i was in at the agreed time , that the journey from the lorry to the room was totally clear and if i did not comply with all these instructions then there would be penalty charges - it was quite intimidating .
neutral	when it was delivered they just_dumped the heavy piece of furniture still in its cardboard_box , in the room .
neutral	deliveries that i have had from john_lewis and from laura_ashley always unpack the item carefully , take away the wrappings ( there was a lot of cardboard and polystyrene etc ) and make_sure that it is in its desired place .
neutral	my wife and i are oaps and we had to really struggle to get the cardboard off , fold it , store and then manoeuvre the heavy bookcase into place .
neutral	we were not happy with this .
neutral	i know that the ' terms & conditions ' state all this but , honestly , how much_trouble and expense would it be for the company to allow 00_minutes extra for the delivery and to dispose of the packaging for us ?
neutral	the main_thing to realise is that this is not a one man job - it is impossible without someone to help you .
neutral	it is also not a quick job - it took me an_hour to assemble 0 x 0 shelf_units .
neutral	having said that the finished product was good .
neutral	it went together well but at the end i felt that it could be a little more rigid with an improved design ( e . g .
neutral	shelves fitting in space allocated for them and cross struts at some places ).
neutral	delivery was excellent ( next_day , even_though i had not paid for that ) but overall it is expensive ; i paid the equivalent of about £_00 per unit but i have seen similar units for £_00 [_link_] and £_00 [_link ].
neutral	be careful to clear your cookies before using ryanair - they note you '_ve already visited and hike the prices the next_day ...
neutral	i flew to biarritz and they weren_'_t that cheap ( when all taxes etc were added ).
neutral	£_000 return , with no extras , except one piece of hold_luggage .
neutral	but they arrived on time both_times and the flight was great .
neutral	they are the only airline to fly direct from london to biarritz .
neutral	i travel to denmark on the sirena seaways every year , and look_forward to the trip as part of my holiday . this year , however , half way through our holiday , we recieved an e_- mail from dfds informing us that the ship had been damaged in a collision with harwich quay , but should be back in service before our return date . at no time was this incident reported on danish tv . i tried to email dfds on several adresses , but could not get a reply . i tried to phone the number given in the email , and got an_automated booking machine . 0 days before our return , we discovered the ferry was out of service for some time . with no options , contact , advice or assistance from dfds , we had no choice but to drive from mid jutland to calais , a 00 hour journey which cost me over £_000 in fuel alone . i have tried , so_far unsuccesfully , to recover this from dfds . a good danish holiday totally spoiled . my review , sirena seaways , 00 , dfds customer service , 0 .
neutral	since i have not yet received the product i ordered it '_s difficult to give an informed review .
neutral	however i acknowledge i received a phone_call explaining the delay and have been promised i will receive the product by the date i urgently need it .
neutral	please respond to your customers in future
neutral	i had these sent as a birthday_present for my mum .
neutral	i thought the choice was ok , but limited .
neutral	however , it didn_'_t really matter as the order was nothing like the picture / description .
neutral	fortunately what was delivered was very good and mum thought they were beautiful .
neutral	the items that i traded are worth far more than what was offered , but as zapper trades in such high volumes it is able to offer such minimal amounts .
neutral	and to be fair it offered more than its competitors .
neutral	slightly_disappointed with how long it took to receive the cheque , almost felt as though i was being exploited .
neutral	granted it was only £_00 but i had sent my items to zapper as soon as i possibly could and it seemed as though zapper were not too bothered in getting my money to me quickly once they had received my items .
neutral	there is no reason_why it should take so long .
neutral	we have used travel_nation previously in 0000 when it was a smaller organisation .
neutral	everything_went perfectly .
neutral	the itinerary that was arranged for us suited_us perfectly and had the attention of a single individual making_sure it was crafted to our needs .
neutral	throughout our whole interaction with travel_nation and our trip , we only ever had to deal with one individual .
neutral	it went perfectly , even when we had decisions and changes to make .
neutral	naturally , when we had another big trip to organize in 0000 we went to travel_nation .
neutral	from the start we were given really good advice and original ideas from our travel_consultant .
neutral	if we wondered into an area where his_knowledge wasn_'_t complete , then he would bring in another consultant .
neutral	very quickly we were all on the same wavelength and we had a good idea of what we wanted to do and how we were going to do it .
neutral	deposit paid , job_done !
neutral	well it would have been under the structure of travel_nation previously , but now they have a delivery team .
neutral	or should i say , non - delivery team .
neutral	admittedly we made changes to our requirements or if not changes then additions ( as in spending more money ).
neutral	we received an initial set of email messages_confirming our requirements followed up by various vouchers or e_- tickets that sometimes were complete but mostly weren_'_t .
neutral	to sum_up , we spent three_months chasing the delivery team at travel_nation through our travel_consultant in order to make_sure they had actually arranged and delivered all that we had ordered .
neutral	we thought they had , only to get to heathrow and find that two of our party of four did not even have the correct visas arranged through travel_nation even_though they had confirmed and taken our money .
neutral	very frustrating .
neutral	in short , what i would recommend if you are an independent traveler , by all means go to travel_nation and use there travel knowledge to develop a wonderful itinerary .
neutral	get a print out of it and then go home to your computer and book it yourself because you can '_t rely_on them to do that bit for you .
neutral	i still think it has the potential to be one of the best and free - thinking travel consultancies in the country as i know that some of the original people are there .
neutral	they have some internal sorting_out to do though .
neutral	no faults to be fair , but the prices are high
neutral	used to get good quotes , these days not so good as i always get better by phoning direct .
neutral	and they use swiftcover . com which is an terrible insurance company .
neutral	booked a room through olotels for a stay in london ( reservation number 0000000 ).
neutral	the booking was non_refundable .
neutral	at the time of travel , i feel ill . understanding the hotel was non_refundable - i contacted the hotel directly to ask if they would be willing to allow the agency ( olotels ) to move the reservation without_penalty .
neutral	the hotel were fair , and agreed they would allow olotels to move the reservation to a future date free of charge .
neutral	i was delighted .
neutral	i sent olotels an email on 00th_november , immediately after_speaking with the hotel , to advise .
neutral	the hotel wanted olotels to formally request the change in an email , and they would agree to it .
neutral	i sent 0 emails chasing this up , each time i got an email_saying ' we will update you shortly '.
neutral	one time i even called and the agent said she would call back in 00_minutes - and didnt !
neutral	finally , 00 days_later , olotels send me an email_saying ' i checked into the hotel , and as a result , i will be charged in full '.
neutral	what a fiasco !
neutral	when will it end ?
neutral	i done all the hard work , the hotel were happy to move the booking no problem .
neutral	now olotels have left it 00 days when this could have been sorted in 0 phone_call .
neutral	so angry .
neutral	i would avoid them .
neutral	****_update 00th_december_0000 ****
neutral	the supplier offered a 0 night refund which was ok .
neutral	if they acted_upon what the hotel offered ( to move the full reservation ) i would not have lost out on one night .
neutral	i feel olotels were too slow to act and this is why i lost out .
neutral	i feel as though the frontline customer_care let olotels down .
neutral	shame you have to shout about your bad_experience on here before they take things seriously .
neutral	ana from the customer_satisfaction team was very helpful .
neutral	hi i just received the sunglasses the oakley five squared and i was suprised by the size of it . the one size in the internet page i think is not right .
neutral	. the quality of the lenses is excellent but they ' re to small in my face .
neutral	that ; s why i send you a return quest .
neutral	i used to go sainsburys but everything is so expensive compared to asda or tesco .
neutral	the only people i ever see in there is old people and students .
neutral	its starting to become the next co - op .
neutral	i ordered the big tasty medium meal from the bulwell branch about 0 days ago and the service was super quick .
neutral	parking_spaces for motorbikes which was great .
neutral	the chips were hot , orange juice cold , but the big tasty burger had no bacon on it , lots of lettuce and barely warm .
neutral	i ordered my goods 00th_july , and i still_haven_'_t received them , today it is 00th_july
neutral	tried for 0 days to order on - line for delivery in uk ordered in canada .
neutral	kept telling_me there were " server problems ".
neutral	the system finally let_me complete on the 0rd day , however was subsequently advised by serenata , due to ' technical_difficulties ' the order could not be delivered on the date requested .
neutral	offered to upgrade and deliver the next_day , which they did .
neutral	kept me advised by e_- mail ( although 0 hrs difference as to where i am ).
neutral	recipient was thrilled with the bouquet !
neutral	had a look on here at the reviews before i tried a sample order , noticed that the reviews were very mixed but the company have a great range of good quality clothing ( ie craghoppers ).
neutral	i was nearly driven to distraction from the first email , i placed the order and when it was sent back to me for review it was completely wrong , not just an odd error but multiple errors from wrong sizes to missing garments , this happened over and over , even with the review of the embroidery problems occurred , and eventually i had to call several_times to complain .
neutral	the order address and date , which were vitally_important as the order was being sent internationally was also messed_up and i had to complain yet again ...
neutral	in conclusion , the products are excellent , the embroidery is truly excellent , but the customer service is ridiculously bad , ... would i buy again ?... yes , but only because the range of products , price and embroidery is good , i would be prepared this time for the numerous_emails , international phone_calls etc to manage and make_sure that the order was correct , as there is no doubt that attention to detail is poor in every part of this business , which is a real_shame considering the good product that they produce
neutral	took 00_minutes for customer service to answer phone , twice .
neutral	also booked flowers at 0 am , they were delivered at 00 : 00 only just catching my wife before she went home .
neutral	i was promised they would be delivered by 00 : 00
neutral	range of tyres , price and availability great .
neutral	free delivery good too .... but don_'_t put 00 / 00 hr delivery when in actually takes 0 / 0 days ...
neutral	put 0 days ... it '_s still free .
neutral	m
neutral	very good prices and easy to order tyres , but you must ring the tyre_fitting_bay because what you put on the order for time and day of fitting has no relevance with the fitting_bay as i found out when i went to have my tyres_fitted , and was told i would have to wait at_least one and a half to two hours !!
neutral	as i use my van for work i had to re - book another time which was not convenient for me .
neutral	not given the e ticket receipt within 0 days not as promised
neutral	i was impressed with the speed of delivery .
neutral	however your staff answering the telephone are without basic knowledge .
neutral	i made him aware i knew nothing about the items .
neutral	i received the alarms then told by the electrician i needed something to secure them to .
neutral	as it was the bank_holiday it was difficult to find anyone open .
neutral	could have been more sales for you .
neutral	the person on the telephone should have advised i needed them
neutral	i looked to see whether there was a charge for using a credit_card because i know that most companies apply them these days .
neutral	the price window at the side of the page gave_me a total that did not include such a charge , but they added it during the payment process anyway .
neutral	obviously , i missed something .
neutral	my complaint is that the policy of adding such a charge is not clear and transparent during the payment process .
neutral	real nuisance having to have the parts delivered to my address as i was not present - partgeek would not accept sending them to my neice a few streets_away .
neutral	i have not fitted the parts yet - will have to wait_until early august .
neutral	should be ok as they are munro .
neutral	flowers were delivered in a timely_manner , but due to the high ambient temperatures , the flowers were starting to wilt by early evening despite changing to cool water to help them .
neutral	so a little dissapointed but not essentially a fault of serenata .
neutral	had excellent service and very effective help and advice when had a problem .
neutral	cars as good as others .
neutral	but be prepared to wait for an unacceptable time since never enough staff on hand to clear the queues quickly .
neutral	i ordered some gloves that cost £_00 . 00 that only lasted a week - not very good since i was recommended to use your website .
neutral	transfer , accommodation and shooting range were all cool but our guide tried to take us to the most expensive bars so we did our own thing
neutral	good quality book and print , software is capable but has a steep_learning_curve especially for the less computer_literate .
neutral	delivery speeds are dire and can be well over a week before your item arrives .
neutral	when it says 00 tablets i certainly got every indication that it was 00 days supply .
neutral	it is in fact vitamins & minerals split into 0 capsules , so 00 days supply !
neutral	despatch was first_class , very prompt .
neutral	the correct goods arrived .
neutral	however , i paid close to £_00 for next_day delivery ( having ordered them at 0 in the morning ) and they took 0 days to arrive .
neutral	not so happy as i really needed them the previous day .
neutral	trainer was meant to have 0 settings , never seemed to make any difference which setting you have it on .
neutral	took it back to shop .
neutral	they were going to ring the service department / supplier .
neutral	have heard_nothing since .
neutral	very disappointed with service .
neutral	good prices and the codes work , but their claim about instant vouchers just isnt true .
neutral	it '_s happened both_times i '_ve_used them and i '_ve had to send numerous_emails to get the codes .
neutral	mostly the service is excellent and i have used the site on numerous_occasions .
neutral	however two_weeks_later i am still_waiting for part of my order .
neutral	no alternative has_been offered neither has an explanation .
neutral	maybe some extra discount is in order for my next transaction .
neutral	i bought annual_worldwide_cover on the recommendation of a friend to cover trips to new_zealand , australia , greece and usa ..
neutral	in fact , i ' d probably have done better to buy cover only for the 0 days down under when we won_'_t be covered by our friend '_s policy .
neutral	unfortunately , i was rather over - impressed by icar '_s home page which referred to cdw in the us being covered by the us and worldwide policies .
neutral	so when i received my policy certificate i was surprised that cdw was not included .
neutral	i had to re - read the home page twice more before i realised my mistake .
neutral	cdw is only covered with worldwide plus , so i ' d have had to pay extra for this .
neutral	i think the website could be much clearer on this .
neutral	i '_ve since sought some dummy quotes to test whether i '_ll get value for money anyway or whether i should upgrade but in greece , i '_m being offered only hire deals that include insurance with zero_excess and in usa the quote also came back offering cdw with no excess .
neutral	so i ' d recommend this type of policy for countries where excesses are high ( as much as a $ 0000 in australia and also high in spain ).
neutral	but check out carefully what the deals are in the countries you plan to visit .
neutral	sorry for the delay in replying but although my initial_impression was great , i wanted to see how the flowers would last .
neutral	there were a few wilting items on arrival but i thought they would perk up after being in transit .
neutral	- they haven_'_t and the roses and carnations are not lasting well after just 0 days .
neutral	i would have expected all the flowers to last at_least 0 days before looking past their best .
neutral	courier decided to leave card but no materials , despite sayingvon card to phonecme if needed or if not to leave
neutral	i ordered a kitchenaid pasta attachment for my mixer on 0 january_0000 .
neutral	the website said it was in stock .
neutral	after a week it had not arrived and the payment had been taken from my bank .
neutral	i telephoned only to be told it was not in stock and kitchenaid did not have any .
neutral	they expected them in the middle of january .
neutral	nothing happened and i had to phone again on at_least two occasions .
neutral	it was finally delivered on 00 january_0000 .
neutral	the company was obviously having problems with supply but never once contacted me to explain .
neutral	very poor .
neutral	when the item was in stock i received an email_telling_me that it would be delivered monday 00 january , it also had a tracking_link .
neutral	this was excellent as you did not even have to put in any numbers .
neutral	i was emailed with a one hour delivery slot , which the item arrived within .
neutral	excellent packaging , excellent product .
neutral	just work on ensuring your website displays the right stock details .
neutral	before i telephoned on one occasion the website said in stock again , only to be told it was not .
neutral	get this right and some communication to the customer , email is fine and you will get five_stars .
neutral	to conclude , i would use you again .
neutral	i have used serenata before and never had a problem .
neutral	however , this time the basket of flowers i ordered as a gift for a relative was " in a very poor state " when it arrived , according to another relative who was there when it arrived ( courtesy of yodel ).
neutral	the plants had " just been dumped in the basket after having been removed from their pots , with no attempt to firm them in ".
neutral	the roots were exposed and in the end the whole_thing had to be replanted .
neutral	i am giving three stars because my previous_experiences have been positive and it could be that the basket had been badly transported ( and knowing yodel i would not be at all surprised ).
neutral	however , when i ordered the basket i didn_'_t envisage the recipients having to spend their time trying to salvage it ...
neutral	i took_advantage of 00_%_discount offer , so did a scour for older release i wanted and found five .
neutral	they were all played and had scratches ( but playback was ok , a couple of clicks ), the guys at chemical didn_'_t let_me know about this was the case in advance which is why they get 0_stars .
neutral	incredibly i haven_'_t received yet this item .
neutral	i have contacted several_times with dhl_express here in madrid and we have specify a delivery schedule and they don_'_t deliver me the item .
neutral	as soon as i have received it i will send you a confirmation e_- mail .
neutral	thanks in advance .
neutral	manuel bellido .
neutral	generally , buying on line is a good experience .
neutral	the website is functional and with patience one can usually find what one wants .
neutral	there are a couple of points that were missing when i last ordered online which i found some what annoying .
neutral	!
neutral	no provision to use reward_points shown and 0 .
neutral	no area to price match products , which meant a phone_call .
neutral	i was told i could add a note at the bottom of the order , which in the past i have done but it has never worked .
neutral	otherwise ok . post times now have reached an unacceptable delay , not saa fault but post_office '_s .
neutral	i notice now provision to pay for delivery which is quicker but adds to costs .
neutral	product is great and the delivery company even took account of 0 . 0mnth pregnant_wife when delivering .
neutral	0_*+
neutral	however , purchase made through_topcashback some months_ago and according to that platform winterfields have yet to ratify .
neutral	0 *
neutral	yes i ' d buy here again as it '_s the product that matters , but i would like to see a little more pace in the rear of house functions .
neutral	the windows are excellent , however , the whole_process was arduous and frustrating .
neutral	on arrival of the installation engineer it became_clear that most of what we had asked for over the phone 0 months previously had not been updated on the records so we had a desperate morning liasing between the engineer and their customer service to make_sure everything was as we wanted .
neutral	this also included unexpected extra costs as we had received new invoices but they were so unclear that we weren_'_t able to follow the changes in the charges .
neutral	we ' re happy with the windows but when we replace the future ones i '_m not sure we will use ventrolla as the experience was not a pleasant one .
neutral	not too good ...., but at_least they sorted it out
neutral	i have been using tecc for about 0 months and the service was great up until their xmas0000 discount campain then all of the popular range went out of stock for a full month .
neutral	i could not then get my normal shot and had to find another source .
neutral	if you are going to run a big discount month then please make_sure you have the stock to service it .
neutral	hopefully all back to the normal great service .
neutral	good value for this high_spec siemens induction_hob , but unfortunately one of the rings wasn_'_t working .
neutral	the siemen '_s engineer was great , but it took two_weeks to fix ( waiting for a new circuit_board to come from germany ) and two_days of staying at home to be around for the engineer .
neutral	apparently he ' d not seen a fault on this model in the 00 months that it '_s been on the market .
neutral	so i guess that was my bad_luck .
neutral	still , it '_s all fine now and works_brilliantly .
neutral	overall i '_m really pleased , but it was inconvenient at the time .
neutral	of course , the faulty appliance isn_'_t down to kitchen_appliances , who turned the order around efficiently .
neutral	ordered on 00st_dec and delivery quoted was 0 - 0 days .
neutral	contacted customer_services on 00th to ask when i should expect it and they said they would come_back to me .
neutral	they never did .
neutral	i contacted again spoke to the same person and they said again they contact the courier and let_me know .
neutral	again same false promise left me waitng for a call that never came .
neutral	so based on the delivery promise should have arrived before new year but arrived on 0rd_jan .
neutral	not to far from the dog track , the owners were very plesant and helpfull .
neutral	the room was clean and comfortable , and the breakfast was nice and hot .
neutral	the website made no mention of the fact the hire required the purchase of a full_tank of gas .
neutral	the small_print stated the local supplier may require the purchase of a full_tank of gas , with no option to return the car in the same fuel condition as collected .
neutral	in discussions with the dollar_rental staff they stated the rental code ' fleur ' required the purchase of a full_tank of gas with no option to opt for returning the car in the same fuel state as when hired .
neutral	if you knew the full_tank of gas had to be purchased then why not put it on your webiste ?
neutral	that would have been the honest and honourable way of treating your customers .
neutral	don_'_t offer weekend or out of working hours installation .
neutral	not idea for a household with no one home during the day .
neutral	boat was on time loading and off loading was ok ( althougth there was no return to your vehicles announcement either way ) duty_free shop was being remodelled so bit cluttered but all ok except for the food .
neutral	the fish and chips was soft and sloppy the curry was army style basically meat in gravy mix and the popodoms were actually hardly cooked so one side they were slighty risen with the other side hard and solid - straight out of the packet .
neutral	i said to the girl " the popdoms are not actually cooked " as i handed it back to her as inedible and she just shrugged .
neutral	this food situation was the same last time .
neutral	it is no more hard work to produce good food as bad and i am really surprised how poor your chef is .
neutral	having been given a delivery date , i waited in all day but my item never turned_up .
neutral	nobody had the decentcy to contact me to update me of the situation .
neutral	i did however get a phone_call at 0 . 00 am on the sunday after the delivery date from the driver saying he was half an_hour away .
neutral	he arrived but had no explanation as to why it was not delivered on the due date or to why i was not informed of any delay ..
neutral	however the customer service that followed was good , but was unable to give any reason for the delay
neutral	bought lots of things over the last yr
neutral	had a few delays and dramas but at the moment everything has turned_up !
neutral	left a 0_star_review for a company ive had a bad_experience with , only to have it removed and " under review "... has_been over a week now and have tried to contact trustpilot 0 times to find out why , no response at all ....?... maybe this will get a reply !
neutral	!
neutral	very impressed with you but not impressed with the courier you have
neutral	more options on colour would be nice .
neutral	mine was a bargain bin ebay purchase .
neutral	it '_s fine but too big for what i need ... it would have been too expensive to buy the correct case .
neutral	i know you are paying for the delivery when you have flowers delivered ( although my order included " free delivery ") but my wife received flowers which i reakon would have been about £_00_-£_00 from a store but cost me £_00 on - line .
neutral	somewhat_disappointed
neutral	whilst the customer service of the company seems pretty good the course i followed ( social_media marketing for dummies ) was clearly created a long time ago .
neutral	most of the social_media interfaces have changed since the course was designed and several of the features have ceased completely ( eg there are chunky sections on linkedin answers and linkedin events both of which are no_longer supported ).
neutral	worse still , there is a whole module on gowalla which ceased_trading a year_ago .
neutral	the section on roi and analytics is less_than useful , and the test at the end seems a little bug ridden .
neutral	a shame because there is some good stuff in here and the style of presentation is engaging ( even if the sections are a little brief in some cases ).
neutral	trevor lambert ec0000
neutral	00kg in 00 boxes which i paid £_000 in courier fees and the driver refused to take 00 feet further to the lift and dropped them just inside the front_door , so whilst they met their obligations , by no means was it a good service .
neutral	still_awaiting delivery of our cotbed .
neutral	over a day late .
neutral	supposed to have been delivered on 00 / 00 / 00 am and i had to phone number on text massage at 0 : 00 to find out where delivery was .
neutral	was told the cotbed would arrive at 0 . 00pm so waited in for the delivery only to have a call after this time saying delivery driver was in penzance and wouldn_'_t get to me .
neutral	wasted day and no communication to let us know the situation .
neutral	awaiting arrival this morning .
neutral	when receive it it was flat_pack but not understand the instruction to build on it took me hour to fix it is not bed it is for the guest who sleep on it
neutral	some employees are chearful but most are not happy .
neutral	it is hit or miss as to good or bad attitude .
neutral	it would be nice to offer covered or partially covered parking .
neutral	it is diffucult to get to the lot and the entrance is poorly_designed , so a few tips to not get lost would help .
neutral	a quote from stoneacre online site :
neutral	' stoneacre offer full lifetime_guarantee on used cars , saving you having to purchase any warranty and are the only main uk motor dealers to do so .'
neutral	earlier today i bought a mondeo yp00jnx from doncaster stoneacre , with lifetime_guarantee available .
neutral	what is not available is any idea if there is a cost for the guarantee , which in their above_statement , suggests is included in the sale price .
neutral	far from it , the salesman will suggest a price , but i have subsequently found that this is negotiable and has_been reduced from £ 0000 to - well whatever figure you like .
neutral	this is far from transparent and more akin to the dodgy dealings of old where the skilled salesperson assesses just how much money can be squeezed out of his befriended victim .
neutral	come on stoneacre , if this is a warranty covered through an insurance company , then there is a fixed cost and this should be made clearly available .
neutral	i cannot_believe i fell for it , but after a long period in the hands of gently persuasive sales staff , my guard dropped and i was reeled in .
neutral	disappointed stoneacre , that such tactics are still being used and what happens in your sales offices is not what you are publishing online .
neutral	your quote at the beginning of this review is wrong or misleading or i have been sold something that should have been given .
neutral	which is it ?
neutral	this seems an offer to review a heater i ordered , but as it turns_out not to be in stock , and it is likely to be another couple of weeks before i might receive it , i really can ` t comment on it !
neutral	my order was taken and confirmed when i later received and email_telling_me the flavour i required wasn_'_t in stock and had to wait 0 days for it to be delivered .
neutral	in the mean time i had to purchase protein_powder elsewhere while my order was pending , which put me further out of pocket .
neutral	not the best experience .
neutral	ordered 0 x designer gloss_black radiators + valves both showing in - stock and available for free next_day delivery - both delivered as promised .
neutral	received email_confirmations and tracking_numbers .
neutral	logistically 0_stars .
neutral	only 0_stars though as valve supplied (' essential extras ') cannot possibly fit the single radiator supplied - had to purchase a different type of valve .
neutral	cash_genie offered me cash when i needed it so i guess i cant_fault them there .
neutral	the 00 pound for quick payments a bit of a downer as i was only borrowing 00 which in actual fact was 00 with the quick payment thing .
neutral	on my first order i receive it with no trouble .
neutral	but on the second time order , i ordered 0 rockshox reba rlt with poploc , but i only receive 0 lockout , and it was a pusholc in stead of a poploc , in the same minute i received the order on the 0th of may , i sent a mail to complain_about it , in the email , i mention that , i would like to have a lockout for right and usage , in stead of that i receive today 0 poploc in stead of 0 and it '_s for left and usage .
neutral	i hope you can give attention on this issues ,
neutral	best regards ,
neutral	hugo martins
neutral	i was not pleased when i turned_up to get the car to find myself on the end of a hard_sell trying to make me take out insurance at an exorbitant rate against a range of very unlikely events .
neutral	it should not cost 00_euros to replace a tyre and it should not cost anything like the fees quoted if something went wrong with the car .
neutral	lastly i was not pleased to find myself charged 00_euros for a full_tank of petrol .
neutral	the car should be available with a minimum amount of petrol and then it should be up to me how much petrol to put in the car .
neutral	certainly it is unreasonable to be charged for a full_tank of petrol and then told i had to bring the car back empty .
neutral	nothing special and then found thing i brought was cheaper when we arrived !
neutral	crazy way of delivering lets this service down , the glasses are great , good value and pretty stylish .
neutral	but when things go_wrong no one knows where the deliveries are , when they will get here and when they have gone_missing , i get you save_money sending them in bulk from what ever third world country makes them but it doesn_'_t work .
neutral	ordered a dewalt circular_saw through ebay , waited a few_days and no delivery , sent an email and was advised a new model replacement would be dispatched once in stock .
neutral	waited another 00 days and received the newer_model but wrong_voltage .
neutral	sent back using buyaparcels courier collection , waited another week while the incorrect unit was checked before the correct item was dispatched .
neutral	all in all a mixed experience , just unlucky with the mistakes and having to wait 0_weeks for what usually would be 0 - 0 days .
neutral	would still recommend as the pricing and service is great .
neutral	when i went to your local_depot , to get my 0 new tyres at a cost of £_000 , it was found that the locking_wheel_nut was damaged and the depot could not do anything so i had to find another garage who had the correct equipment .
neutral	i located one after a day or so searching on the net .
neutral	this was a small local tyre and mot company who had a dynomec ltd . locking_nut removal_tool .
neutral	i arrived to see if they could help and even_though they were very busy , the owner had a look at the damaged locking_nut and the damaged tool and said he thought he could get it off with just his normal air impact_wrench gun . he removed all other three first and then got the broken one off in a matter of seconds .
neutral	he would not even charge me for it but i did insist on making a payment .
neutral	my question is why do national depots not not have the correct equipment to break out broken wheel_nuts .
neutral	i know where i will be going for my next set of tyres and it wont be national .
neutral	i booked a car and made a point of hiring a child_seat for my 0 year_old daughter .
neutral	reading through the car_rental voucher , it appears that the car_seat has not been included and is available as an extra .
neutral	it doesn_'_t appear as if i can adjust the booking online either .
neutral	not acceptable , what happens if the rental company doesn_'_t have one available at pick_up .
neutral	moral , check the small_print !
neutral	furniture choice got my mattress delivered on time and quite quickly .
neutral	the truck delivering the mattress was supposed to be manned by 0 people but i ended_up helping .
neutral	the driver made the comment that he was only supposed to deliver to the ground_floor but " would help me up with it ".
neutral	my wife is 0 feet tall so i don_'_t know what would have happened if i wasn_'_t there .
neutral	it kind of let furniture choice down .
neutral	remember these_guys are just a third_party between you and the actual rental company .
neutral	the booking , prices etc on the rentalcars . now site was good - no_problems at all .
neutral	the comments_below are more applicable to dollar at las_vegas airport .
neutral	long wait at the dollar desk to do the paperwork - of the 00 windows , only 0 were manned , so it took about 00_minutes .
neutral	long wait when we finally got to pick_up the car - " sorry_sir , we have none left !!"
neutral	it took nearly another 00_mins to get the type of car that i thought we had reserved - it looks_like they work on a first come first served policy and just hope they have enough .
neutral	the outcome was we ( eventually ) got the 0 - seater mini van we had ' reserved ' - a brand_new one with just 000_miles on the clock .
neutral	i did email some feedback but got no response to my issue .
neutral	i am a little disappointed that the ferrule on the coopers walking_stick ( ccs0000 ) has already broken with only 0 days use .
neutral	the stick has cut through the ferrule already and i would have thought it should have lasted a little_longer_than that !
neutral	not the normal quality you get from sunrise medical products .
neutral	nothing wrong with the trip .
neutral	the ship was on time and the crossing comfortable and the food ok .
neutral	only problem was the booking website .
neutral	you enter the port of departure .
neutral	so why do you insist on listing departure times from both french ports , calais and dunkerque , on the same page , when you have already chosen the port of departure ?
neutral	surely if you select a particular port to leave from , you would expect the website to show the times for that port and not include another !!
neutral	very easy to make a mistake .
neutral	have had some very good experiences with amazon with amazingly fast deliveries , and had some bad .
neutral	slow delivery plus something not arriving at all from an amazon connected supplier .
neutral	amazon did refund the money eventually though .
neutral	this was my first time of ordering medication online so wasn_'_t completely confident in the process .
neutral	my 00 yr_old dog has a grade 0 heart murmour and is now heavily reliant on medication to keep him comfortable .
neutral	after_placing my order , to ensure the correct meds had been purchased and payment received i tried for two_days to contact customer_services to confirm the order but the phones were not answered once .
neutral	eventually after sending an email a lady got back to me ( sam i think ) who was polite and reassuring .
neutral	after confirming my order it arrived within 0 days , was well_packaged and all meds we ' re present and correct .
neutral	my vets charge me £_000 a month compared to animed charging £_000 so massive_savings . apart_from the lack of communication initially the experience was good .
neutral	i take some responsibility as i left it a little late before ordering the meds .
neutral	next time il do it a week earlier and i won_'_t be quite as frantic .
neutral	i will be happy to use animed again .
neutral	hopefully 0_stars next time
neutral	could not use my mobile_phone in holland , caused quite a few problems
neutral	the experience from_start to finish was very easy .
neutral	the flowers were for my fiancé for valentines_day ..... her comment was that there seemed to be more foliage than flowers .
neutral	if i ' d have walked_into a florist and asked them to build me a bouquet for the same money i spent , i ' d have got a much_better result .
neutral	the flowers were delivered on time and were as_described but only just . the picture_showed a much healthier bloom than we received .
neutral	i was offered £_00 for my laptop originally .
neutral	then they changed it to £_00 .
neutral	eventually they honoured their original quote .
neutral	not incredibly professional to try and change the original price .
neutral	however after negotiation they proved honourable and fair and gave_me the £_00 .
neutral	i would recommend them , as i believe my experience was a one off and a mistake by someone down the line .
neutral	things_happen , but this is a good company i feel and they gave_me a good price .
neutral	happy customer .
neutral	we sent a camera and three mobile_phones .
neutral	we got little_bit more cash than others but the operational process was slower and more complicated than other_providers we used in the past .
neutral	a trouble_free and pleasant_experience until i met the ' buyer ' of my cartier who reduced the phone quote by £_000 and was so rude , self opinionated and objectionable i was literally on the point of leaving - had it not been for the professionalism of the ' seller ' of the franck muller who saved the day !
neutral	if you operate a ' good cop bad cop ' routine there it '_s working .
neutral	if you don_'_t then the ' buyer ' needs some people skills , urgently .
neutral	i will use you again , but keep that person away from me !
neutral	the ' muller is wonderful .
neutral	it was valued for insurance_purposes at £_00 , 000
neutral	too many choices unavailable for purchase .
neutral	i now go_elsewhere .
neutral	i ordered a tin of por engine_enamel and it was delivered very quickly , as usual .
neutral	however , upon reading the instructions on the tin i noted that it recommends application of a coat of normal por - 00 prior to applying their engine_enamel - this meant i had to place another order and pay for p_&_p a second time for a tin of standard por - 00 .
neutral	it would '_ve been nice to have such info / recommendations on the product listing on the website so that i could '_ve ordered both products at the same time & only paid for p_&_p once .
neutral	otherwise thought i cannot_fault the speed of delivery or quality of the product - it '_s second - to - none .
neutral	i would recommend it to a friend but make_sure that you give your self two_weeks , they say money in account on the day they get your phone , a week after i sent it off it arrived there , it then took a further week for the money to arrive in my bank_account !
neutral	arriving / parking / departing is hassle - free .
neutral	it takes longer_than the alternative routes , but is far cheaper
neutral	not as good as p_& o in terms of shopping / food / on - board entertainment but what there is is similarly over - priced and underwhelming .
neutral	all in all nothing not to be expected .
neutral	solid enough build , trim around storage finished a little sloppily in one corner , dirt mark in one place , packaging filthy - had to clean carpet where it had been .
neutral	the delivery was left_outside , seems the delivery chap did not ring the bell .
neutral	a few_years_ago the great joy of using edinburgh_airport was the parking arrangements .
neutral	no_longer .
neutral	charges for parking have more than doubled in just a few_years , card fees have been introduced , and the number_plate recognition is erratic .
neutral	i feel as if we regular_users are being milked .
neutral	there are no staff on site out of hours now , and the call_centre was unhelpful when i broke_down within the car_park .
neutral	the rac truck was not allowed in via the bus entrance , requiring the dispatch of a second vehicle and and extra 0 hour wait for myself .
neutral	it '_s a shame .
neutral	the price quoted was not what was recived due to a faulty button , we can '_t be 000_% sure but did not believe the button to be faulty when sent , the phone never had issues when in use .
neutral	the flowers were supposed to be left in the porch - particularly as they were left at 0000 !
neutral	!
neutral	they were left_outside fully visible but no_harm was done
neutral	very slow when processing orders , i know you are a big company but make it faster so i can be a happier customers !!!!
neutral	!
neutral	my bottle was indeed delivered the next_day and the packaging was adequate .
neutral	however , for a bottle that costs £_000 , i thought that a little more effort wouldn_'_t have gone a miss .
neutral	that said the box the presentation_box the bottle came in was in an just acceptable condition , apart_from a 00mm blue pen mark on the bottom of the box .
neutral	however , my biggest disappointment with the presentation was that part of the labelling on the bottle was missing .
neutral	not great , seeing as this was bought as a wedding gift .
neutral	i didn_'_t dispute this as there wasn_'_t enough to dispute this and get another sent in better condition before the wedding .
neutral	so i can '_t comment on after sales customer service .
neutral	the order and delivery went very smoothly .
neutral	my friends sent me a photograph of their bouquet , the roses were fine but i expected many more fresia .
neutral	if you give me an email address , i would happily send you their photograph along with the one i saw on the internet so you can see what i mean .
neutral	i placed an order over a weekend and got a generic_reply regarding order confirmation .
neutral	by friday , as i still had not heard whether the order had been fulfilled , yet alone dispatched , i contacted customer_services .
neutral	they stated the order had been dispatched a few_days earlier and it did arrive via_royal_mail later that day .
neutral	luckily we have a good relationship with our postman and he left the package in our garage .
neutral	i ordered this item from wicken_toys as it was not held in stock by elc initially then other online_retailers .
neutral	the 0 items i ordered from elc all arrived on time and as i ' d no clear timeline for this item i went_ahead and built the climbing_frame for my son '_s birthday and then subsequently had to dismantle the ladder to fit this cover only a day later .
neutral	had i known , i would have waited the extra day .
neutral	i also find it odd that your terms and conditions require a account to be created and will be adding any items you send into my spam_folder .
neutral	i bought tyre from tyreleader fast delivery at my door in 0 days from france .
neutral	and they recommended all the garages near me that fitted and how much , thought great either deliver to garage or to home i chose home , just as well as i live in glasgow largest city in scotland , and not one of the garages i called fitted motorcycle tyres or even had herd of them .
neutral	i said to garage do you know you are recommended on tyreleaders web_site .?
neutral	not one had even herd of them , glasgow is in the central belt of glasgow but no i had to call the usual_suspects victor divine , mickey oates , ride on , when called ducati great western road glasgow wanted me to wait a week , and all priced between £_00 and £_00 depending if wheel was on or off bike these_guys are bad enough with there over pricing , and should be_ashamed they want you to buy tyre from them .
neutral	so they have the monopoly on it , but sorry guys the internets here .
neutral	so yes tyreleader , great if you have tyre leavers .
neutral	in garage , but failing that what you save in price you lose on having it fitted .
neutral	so my advice phone the garages near you to see if they fit motorcycle tyres and how much , when i asked victor divine honda glasgow .
neutral	how long it took he replied 00_minutes , me and my mate took wheel of with trolly , jack in garage in dark in 0 minutes shame on you victor divine and all the other suspects in glasgow you know who you are , i will never cross any of there doors again .
neutral	ps tyreleader asked for garages in glasgow and would investigate .
neutral	done nothing no explanation just an_apology .
neutral	i ordered a similar product from a different site on the same day .
neutral	the other delivery was done in four days ( to france ) using standard mail .
neutral	the healthmonthly delivery took three_weeks using their courier .
neutral	the delivery costs were very similar .
neutral	so if you are not in a hurry the prices seem to be ok and service in general is good .
neutral	great website ,, really good products and fast delivery .
neutral	sadly my cologne had leaked and i lost about 00_% of it .
neutral	i '_m_sure they didn_'_t do it deliberately and i would order from them again but they ' d have to package things a little better
neutral	overall score :
neutral	ffx 0_stars
neutral	courrier 0_star
neutral	i had no_problems with ffx .
neutral	the price was great and the goods were sent quickly , so brilliant service .
neutral	however , before purchasing take into_consideration that the courrier used is quite bad , so check elsewhere .
neutral	the selected courrier is ukmail and when they arrived they rang the door_bell and went to look for the package in the van .
neutral	as i waited at the door i could hear the delivery person throw stuff around scrambling to find the package .
neutral	as a consequence of mishandling the packaging and bubble_wrap was holed in several places and hence , one item ( a stabila protective_cover ) was scuffed , dirty and slightly torn .
neutral	i just do not have the time to complain over it , but if it was a gift i would be far more disappointed and take it further .
neutral	i ordered leather insoles - synthetic were sent .
neutral	delivery was fast a + for that .
neutral	on erecting the shed it turned_out that both side_panels where not correct_size which meant the windows would not fit .
neutral	a quick phone_call meant replacements would be sent out asap .
neutral	this created a problem because i had obviously started building the shed .
neutral	i had to dismantle it and wait fir the replacements to arrive .
neutral	0 days_later they arrived .
neutral	courier would not take the others away .
neutral	so i started building it again only to discover the same problem .
neutral	omg headache tense nervous headache .
neutral	so on the phone again .
neutral	but this time rather_than get new sides i told them just to send new windows cut to the correct_size in order to fit the side_panels supplied .
neutral	they agreed which meant i could complete the build .
neutral	i finaly got to the last part which was to put on the roof felt .
neutral	but on rolling it out it was full of rips .
neutral	it was of no use at all which meant i had to buy a new roll
neutral	over all i am happy with the shed but i could have done without the headache .
neutral	went to website , stated in stock , ordered then told it was not in stock as someone must have ordered that second with me (_sic )
neutral	while travel up offered a good price i found the site to be massively frustrating .
neutral	frequent crashes , parts of the detail entry windows not loading until the window was shut_down and opened again , and frequent errors at major stages of the process .
neutral	insurance was overpriced , found cheaper immediately elsewhere .
neutral	good enough , but needs a lot of website improvement - especially handling something as expensive as transatlantic_flights .
neutral	so_far i have bought a number of nomination products . the price / range etc is great , as is the customer service once ordered .
neutral	the website however is awful , with each click taking a long time and often being ' booted out ' and having to start again .
neutral	i am sure some people just give up .
neutral	i have just tried it again to see it is better , and it seems to be .
neutral	so maybe ok now .
neutral	we '_ll see !
neutral	!
neutral	really easy to order lots of texts and emails about status etc .
neutral	when delivered bit disappointed with size of bunch could have been me thinking original picture was bigger , ordered balloon which did not arrive so spoilt surprise a bit , but was refunded on balloon
neutral	my order was logged as been received at 00 : 00 pm on saturday .
neutral	it did not arrive until thursday .
neutral	the product and price were good .
neutral	our trip with pick_up and delivery went very well .
neutral	however , we dropped_off car at the sheraton fishermans wharf , went down the street to our hotel and realised we had left something in the glove_box .
neutral	the office had closed , the after hours number just advised to call back .
neutral	the next_day i went back to the sheraton office of dollar_rent a car when it opened at 0 . 00 and the guy just gave_me another number to call .
neutral	i called that as did our hotel concierge and still no response .
neutral	went back to office and guy there rang then gave_me the phone but i couldn_'_t even hear the message from the lost property answer phone .
neutral	in summary , we just could not get to speak to a person about picking_up our lost property and the office guy at the sheraton didn_'_t want to know .
neutral	the service was good overall did as said on the tin .
neutral	but on the rental paper_work it said that when adding another driver it would not be more than $ 0 dollar the exact price was less_than this amount so i thought great i will add my wife to it when i arrive !!!
neutral	arrived early evening in orlando went to collect the car , i asked to add my wife to the insurance and i nearly hit the floor !!
neutral	$_00 . 00 a day !!
neutral	needless to say i ended_up doing all the driving .
neutral	a great let_down to another wise great experience .
neutral	it is impossible to have a conversation longer_than 0 minutes when either travelling by car or train , as well as in good part of my house ...
neutral	i would expect a better service from such a big company , in 0000 .
neutral	cheap get aways ... thanks
neutral	first off let_me say that i have always thought that talktalk have some good ideas and services but they really can let themselves down .
neutral	firstly calling to offer additional boosts to save call costs when the boost would cost more than my total call costs !
neutral	the real bugbear though is when you have a problem with the line , all starts off well and i can_imagine that if they get it sorted first time the process would be pretty slick , the difficulties arise when the problem does not get fixed first time around .
neutral	their insistence on going back over the same process from the start each and every time is infuriating , why not pick_up from where you have got to !
neutral	then comes the matter of the text_messages to which you can either only reply with a yes or a no , or even worse when you cannot reply at all .
neutral	i had 0 texts in 0 days that were no reply type messages_telling my problem was being worked on when i had already had the problem sorted_out .
neutral	talk about a waste of time !
neutral	there is more but i do not want this to turn in to a rant .
neutral	they need to get their problem handling system sorted_out .
neutral	as i still_haven_'_t received them after ordering them a week_ago i can '_t yet tell you about my satisfaction of them .
neutral	the email from simply_electronics acknowledging my order and a subsequent email_advising about delivery were poorly formatted and difficult to decipher .
neutral	they gave a poor impression of the company .
neutral	the packaging of the camera was inadequate and the corner of the camera box was damaged .
neutral	the receipt came from google_checkout not simply_electronics .
neutral	simply_electronics would help themselves if they adopted systems and packaging of a similar standard as amazon .
neutral	the delivery came in 0 days [ which incuded two public_holidays ].
neutral	if you give them your phone number they keep on calling you to sell other products !!
neutral	also , last order i placed they substituted some items without even asking or advising me .
neutral	i '_ll be wary to order online again , unless it is just one single item .
neutral	easy to order and prompt delivery .
neutral	unfortunately , the returns_procedure is less satisfactory and i was advised to return item by special delivery which cost me a whopping_£_00 .
neutral	i '_m used to online stores offering free returns .
neutral	this company must be cheap , the only reason any one uses them had a washer deliverd by them arrived damaged , pointed_out damage to delivery driver he said you can unpack it and use it .
neutral	had to order a new one to replace it , could get new one but could not get damaged one collected same day so have to find room for two washers . have to say the after service was better_than the delivery , and they went out of there way to sort my problem , nisha made sure my replacment washer and the damaged one were swopped on the same day , thank_you for that .
neutral	orderd from sports_direct but wrong adress put on parcel , sports_direct rang yodel to get it changed , i rang yodel three_times last time on the morning of delivery and was told they had heard from sports_direct and the adress had been changed , next im told parcel had been deliverd to wrong adress , the lincoln center never botherd changing the adress , was only delivery driver who went out of his way to correct the problem , and went the extra_mile to get me the parcel , many_thanks to him .
neutral	this review is based on 0 recent_visit where my first contact was with a receptionist who was not very helpful or customer friendly .
neutral	i was / is trying to work out the best way to print a number of 0x0ft images and through my own experiments at home with an epson 0000 i have decided that hahnemuhle baryta fb is the best suited to my needs .
neutral	when i asked the receptionist about this paper she explained that the printspace did not use it .
neutral	i asked if they would be using it and was told no and received an explanation to do with printer settings that sounded_like a flimsy excuse .
neutral	the receptionist was talking to a fellow employee sitting next to her and it seemed that the conversation they were having was far more important than my inquires .
neutral	i then decided to try printing 0 small a0 test prints on 0 different papers and although the prints i received 0 hours_later looked ok they both had a large thumbprint at the top of each print .
neutral	i wanted to complain at the time but my recent conversations with the receptionist made me think that there would be no point .
neutral	i would liked to say in defence of the receptionist that when a male member of staff ( a printer ?)
neutral	came out into the reception_area she asked_him a question concerning print times .
neutral	his behaviour towards her was quite rude as was his reply , which may account for her uncaring attitude on that particular day .
neutral	i left with 0 test prints and was still a little_confused as what paper would be best suited to my needs so i then decided to email the printspace asking them why they do not use the hahnemuhle baryta fb that i like .
neutral	the explanation i received was different from the receptionists explanation and was as follows
neutral	" we tested the paper your are referring and a lot of other baryta style papers but we found that the canson baryta is a much shaper and better coating and gave better results all_round generally .
neutral	the hahnemuhle base is an imitation of the old analogue paper whereas the baryta is the true bartya paper base taken from ilford '_s b_&_w fiba range and developed for inkjet use .
neutral	we are not in a position to offer this paper at this current time unfortunately ."
neutral	which is fine and dandy but i disagree .
neutral	i don_'_t care whats imitating what and how or why its made the important bit is what it looks_like .
neutral	i have since been in contact with metro and genesis who are quite open to discussions about different_types of papers and will consider_using them .
neutral	it may be more_expensive but fuck it , we get what we pay for .
neutral	wohoo !
neutral	i have placed a number of orders with music_magpie ( mm ) recently & here ’_s my experience .
neutral	for cd ’_s , dvd ’_s & games , as long as there is a barcode , the disks are all there and the album artwork is perfect mm will accept and pay .
neutral	for clothing , mm accepts only a limited number of labels and the item descriptions on the website are not always how you would describe an item .
neutral	the items must be perfect for mm to accept and pay .
neutral	mm does not pay for “ missing ” items although they were all there when they left me .
neutral	the website works well enough when dealing_with barcodes but is slow dealing_with clothing and arbitrarily rejects items without stating a reason for rejection .
neutral	the amounts offered are not good but , in my experience , they are as good as car - booting & avoid the people factor .
neutral	overall , i lost 0 . 0 % from offer through accept / reject to payment .
neutral	you contract to mm t ’_s &_c ’_s so read , understand and accept they ’ re written by mm to mm ’_s advantage .
neutral	if you ’ re not happy don_’_t do it .
neutral	mm uses hermes for collections in my area .
neutral	if you ’ re not going to be in for the 00 hour collection window , the mm website offers very few characters for collection arrangements , “ in the side alley ” is about all you ’ ll get in and then the disinterested guy from hermes fails to collect from the side alley .
neutral	hermes is also more difficult to track than collect_+.
neutral	collect_+ tracking shows up the delays built into the mm system .
neutral	eight boxes sent by collect_+, all delivered to mm within 0 days but in some cases not “ received ” by mm for 00 days .
neutral	the average time ( despatch to cleared money ) was just under 00 days .
neutral	otherwise very good ,
neutral	i placed my order .
neutral	it said that i would receive an acknowledgement email .
neutral	no email arrived , so i sent a message , via the website , to customer service to check whether my order was ok .
neutral	i got no answer .
neutral	i was concerned , as my plumber was waiting for the taps .
neutral	in due course , i got an_automated email_saying my order had shipped and giving tracking_info .
neutral	the correct goods then arrived promptly .
neutral	although it was ok in the end , the order process did not engender confidence .
neutral	i bought a set of bathroom_fittings and they were delivered as promised .
neutral	product quality was ok but fixing_screws_missing from one box so not checked before dispatch .. luckily i had some plugs and screws that i could use but could have been most annoying if i had to go and buy some .
neutral	i notified victoria_plumb but had not response .
neutral	i find paypal a useful financial service but as most of my transactions are small , the fees make it inappropriate for serious business volumes .
neutral	i have also found that they are very quick to return money to a purchaser without understanding the issue properly , seems like the seller is assumed to be at fault and this makes me wary about using paypal on and high loss transaction .
neutral	it is however a conveniant service and one i have used for many_years .
neutral	best prices i have found online .
neutral	sent 0 phones and only got paid for 0 but issue was quickly resolved when i called to complain
neutral	very good service over the years
neutral	i wanted to be picked_up at 0 :_00am so selected that on the bokking page however their system changed it to 00 :_00pm .
neutral	i am travelling tomorrow so have no further review regarding the company until my return .
neutral	having brought from them twice before as thier pricing was competetive and service good .
neutral	my third purchase i was expecting the same level of service , but was let_down initially the correct plug was in pieces when it arrived and parts missing out of the fitting kit which had ben opened .
neutral	the plug that was broken was also the wrong type for the towbar fitting kit . rang up and explained my situation and had the impresion that this couldnt be so but decided to send me another plug .
neutral	this was the same as the broken one except it wasnt broken . so still no good . now into the third week since recieving the towbar and only 0 day from wanting to go on holiday and needed towbar ready for the trip . another phone_call and this time an older person answered and sent me a complete new plug and fitting kit which meant that i could go on holiday .
neutral	felt let_down on my initial call that they didnt listen nor take me seriously .
neutral	köpte en soffa portugal för en tid sedan .
neutral	soffan kom snabbt dock tappar den formen och så fattades det skruvar .
neutral	men jag antar att man_får vad man betalar för :-_d
neutral	i ordered a berghaus_rucksack to be shipped to sweden by dhl , it was i believe shipped by dpd uk ( i got a tracking_number from them anyway ).
neutral	when i tracked it a week_later on dpd uk website i found out they had apparently tried ( not very hard ) to deliver my parcel to me and having not succeeded taken it back to a depot .
neutral	i was home the whole day the tracking page said they had made an attemt to deliver it and had not been contacted by telephone .
neutral	now i '_ll havet to go get it myself at the local post_office , to to much of a hassle , but the fact that dpd ( or a swedish partner what do i know ) lied about trying to deliver it in order to save themselves some time even_though i paid for the service is pretty annoying .
neutral	couldn_'_t be more happy with the rucksack , just hope shipping will improve .
neutral	lack of del instructions no del time & no tracking no .
neutral	i recently had 00 0x0 prints made all were very good .
neutral	when these same prints were produced in a crewe album the one chosen for the front cover came out much_darker_than the 0x0 ( both were produced from the same file ) all the rest in the album were fine .
neutral	i was a little disappointed because the previous books i have had reproduced very well and now i am very reluctant about having any further crewe albums printed in the future .
neutral	most bars arrive on time one lost had to reorder & one despatched day after purchase although purchased two in same hour first one cams on time
neutral	bought a second_hand esp stef carpenter 0 - string baritone , the expensive one , not the sub £_000 .
neutral	great price with it being second_hand and next_day delivery was great ; however the pictures did not show any wear to the top of the headstock , and i can only surmise this came from the woeful packing of the instrument which had been crammed_into a standard guitar box with no case and had the lid taped shut around it .
neutral	surprised there wasn_'_t any more damage to it .
neutral	guitar works_fine and the bulk looks fantastic , only issue being the paint being worn off the top of the headstock where it met the box .
neutral	initial no_hassle booking at fairly short_notice .
neutral	dog supplement paid .
neutral	we were advised by the owner that there was no mobile_phone reception .
neutral	on arrival at site a number of fence_panels were down between adjoining properties which would enable our dog to wander elsewhere and maybe cause issues .
neutral	e_mailed the company that afternoon and additionally ask the question of a possible refund of the dog supplement as the blue_chip website has_been offering " fee free dog accommodation since our booking .
neutral	other than that we '_ve been really pleased with the package , grand kids really appreciated the buckets and spades !
neutral	ent paideia the
neutral	next_day on all other orders but the last one had to chase up
neutral	i bought a pair of boston jeans recently which fitted fine , i also purchase 0 pairs of your redhawk super work trousers which a bit_tight .
neutral	both the same sizes according to you .
neutral	nothing '_s fullproof and i '_m finding that i '_m having to do quite a bit of sidetracking to see if there might be trains running to places i want to go to at the times and dates that i require .
neutral	e . g .
neutral	on 0th_june i want to go from barcelona to chalais ( france ).
neutral	your site doesn_'_t allow me to do that in one go (" sorry no trains found ") so i have to guess various possible routes and work out short stages e . g barcelona - perpignan / barcelona - toulouse .
neutral	toulouse - bordeaux etc .
neutral	because some tickets don_'_t yet seem to be available i had to try dates earlier_than 0th_june to see what might be an itinery with the times .
neutral	my order has not arrived yet so i cannot_comment .
neutral	great pair of shoes from ecco .
neutral	my only issue is with the colour .
neutral	online they looked a dark_brown however when i got them they are a light brown .
neutral	i do highly_recommend this service it '_s awesome , the only_gripe is i was quoted 00_hours for unlock and after 00_hours i was worried i ' d been conned lol .
neutral	the unlock however was completed within 00_hours and has_been problem free
neutral	its service is not really bad .. but some times it delays the delivery too much .
neutral	but in the end my product reaches safe to me ..
neutral	this is an average site .
neutral	there is not much latest material .
neutral	very happy with overall service , very dissapointed you deducted twice the delivery charge to return the pcb board .
neutral	the privacy_settings are really awkward now as its harder not to share everything with everyone ... i dont want my feeds to be public , so take that little globe icon away , mark zuckerberg !
neutral	just cos you like to share everything doesnt mean that we do .
neutral	facebook should be for sharing with who you want .
neutral	the fact that usernames cant be changed more than once means that people can look me up by my username if they cant find me in public searches !
neutral	p . a . n . t . s
neutral	i struggled that they said 0 - 0 days and asked not to chase for 0_weeks !
neutral	worrying !
neutral	in fact i chased after 0_weeks and got a one - line reply ( automated ?)
neutral	and began to get uptight .
neutral	fortunately , they unlocked after more than 0_weeks - but at_least they unlocked it !
neutral	would i use them again ?
neutral	yes - they did the job !
neutral	it was vodafone uk and i see from other reviews that it was a bigger problem - but some notification along the way would have been nice .
neutral	while i have absolutely no_complaints about the posters i received , i was disappointed by the customer service .
neutral	when the posters hadnt arrived after a few_days , i rang up the company , as i needed them for a display .
neutral	the very nice lady i spoke with said that the system showed the posters had been dispatched by 0nd_class post the day after my order , and promised to send another batch first_class the next_day if they hadnt arrived .
neutral	later that day i received a dispatch note from gb_posters , which i found a bit_confusing , as it was the fist such note i had received , but all the same i waited_until the next_day to see what arrived .
neutral	when no posters arrived that day , i rang again and spoke to the same lady_who then told me that she had already sent another batch of posters out first_class , as she was concerned_about my first batch not arriving - it was the second_batch that had generated the dispatch note ...
neutral	so the following_day i finally received my posters , just in time .
neutral	however , when i looked at the postage and order note , i saw that they had been sent second class on the day before i had rung to complain .
neutral	it became_clear to me that in fact the posters werent sent out straight_away , and there had been no second_batch of posters sent off first_class , the dispatch people had just been late in sending the original batch out .
neutral	and then lied to me about it - which i am not too impressed by .
neutral	that aside though , good posters , good price , arrived in good nick etc , just rather misleading and rather ropey customer service .
neutral	on arrival at newcastle i didnt know which car_park to use .
neutral	the paperwork said " on site " but surely both long and short_stay are on site .
neutral	all you see at the short_stay are signs with " huge " costs per day - my worry was being_overcharged so i reversed and went to the long_stay - though thought i had booked short_stay .. all your instructions needed to say was -" go to the short_stay car_park "
neutral	great ordering service , great price but yodel are a useless carrier , online tracking first delivery they need not attempt delivery , i had addressed the delivery to my work address and useless yodel say no delivery to a business address beyond 0 :_00pm they say they attempted the second delivery at 0 :_00pm !!!!
neutral	work cctv dhows they were never near my workplace !!!!!!
neutral	third delivery two day after it should have been delivered arrives .
neutral	yodel claim next_day delivery ........ they are rubbish .
neutral	monster change your delivery courier to one that does what it says it will .
neutral	however , the price on toolshop '_s website went up from £_00 to £_000 as i was searching for comparable prices ... left a pretty nasty taste .
neutral	always receive great service yet the amount of damaged to orders by the courier lets then down , never received an order in good condition .
neutral	good company but they are a bit agressive for me
neutral	would be better to have a telephone_number to speak to staff re delivery .
neutral	not always near a pc .
neutral	other wise good service
neutral	good prices , good products !
neutral	but ....
neutral	expensive delivery to jersey_channel_islands considering when purchasing of ebay the seller usually absorbs the slight increase in delivery charges
neutral	excellent price paid for sunglasses in the sale with free delivery however the 0 - 0 days delivery ended_up being 0 days .
neutral	i love my phone and , so_far , had no_problems with connection or coverage .
neutral	i have had to contact customer service to check / amend stuff and when i have been in contact with their out of uk call_centre service has_been apalling !
neutral	thankfully at moment i am happy with things at the moment and as long as that continues i wont need to endure speaking to representatives with little or no command of english !
neutral	ordered 0 gk shirts in small mens , green .
neutral	shirts arrived but too small , returned for same product but size medium , next order arrives size m but wrong_colour , returned at my cost £ 0 . 00 for your error , not very impressed and not at your usual high_standard
neutral	can '_t fault delivery and turn_around time though , spot on , a credit for the return postage due to your error ?
neutral	free bee for my 00 year_old_son ?
neutral	he buys all his kit from you guys ?
neutral	well i do
neutral	i shopped about before opting to buy from e spares .
neutral	i found many other_sites were offering replacement parts that were not genuine and about the same price or in some cases more .
neutral	the part arrived smothered in bubble_wrap which was good as it ensured it arrived undamaged .
neutral	my only_gripe was the site said if you order before a certain time it would be posted out the same day , i ordered before said time but it took 0 days to arrive , it wasn_'_t the postal service as i didn_'_t get a despatch_notification for 00_hours after ordering .
neutral	would i use e spares again - definitely .
neutral	i purchased 0 ski boot bags , and the web_site stated that these items were in stock .
neutral	however , they were not in stock , and i had to change the order and wait for delivery from the supplier before it was shipped .
neutral	so delivery took some time .
neutral	as a long_standing customer i feel it is important to have continuity of " lines "
neutral	of e_liquid .
neutral	when i rang liberty_flights customer_services they said they were stopping stocking " stuyvesant vg ".
neutral	i also suggested that they stock bigger ( 000cc ) bottles of lower strength juices but was politely told the lowest strength of any flavour in this size was 00mg .
neutral	so i am in the process of , reluctantly , taking my trade elsewhere .
neutral	boats and trips were ok .
neutral	however we paid for a flexible return from calais to dover which said we had to phone 0 hours before journey .
neutral	we actually phoned some 0 hours before scheduled return from calais to defer trip by 00_hours only to be told nothing was available for at_least 0 days !!
neutral	i subsequently booked a return with p_& o with no problem at all although of couse this cost me extra money .
neutral	what was more annoying still was that there were people at calais booking the journey with dfds so i cannot understand the problem .
neutral	i would seriously have to consider whether i would use dfds again .
neutral	had two years home insurance with axa - had good info about dealing_with two minor problems and rapid communication with assessors they use .
neutral	however my premium was hiked dramatically and they were unwilling to negotiate lower price despite_being quoted at a much_lower price on money supermarket .
neutral	the image quality was good , although i did provide a high_res photo .
neutral	however , the frame arrived partly cracked .
neutral	not surprised as it '_s made of delicate wood ( i ordered the slim frame type ), and considering it was a large print , the packaging was never going to ultimately protect it when shipping .
neutral	booked this a long way back to get a decent price .
neutral	i got the vehicle i asked for ( ford_fiesta ) and i paid the price i was originally_quoted but the vehicle had seen better days .
neutral	dents , scratches front and rear , drivers mirror housing was cracked , inside was dusty throughout .
neutral	i saw cars in better condition ( opel_corsa , fiat_000 ) fom the same company running about - did i get the dud car of the week ?
neutral	not sure , it still got us where we wanted to go but still felt a little let_down due to the state of the car .
neutral	just saying !
neutral	might be more tactful to send a feedback request only after the item has_been delivered .
neutral	thanks for the tracking_number though .
neutral	last i heard ( from rpoyal mail ), is this : " item ja000000000gb arrived at southampton mail centre on the 0000 - 00 - 00 and we are currently processing it ."
neutral	that would be two_days ago ( no , not 0 days since i checked ; twoi days since anything happened ) ...
neutral	new offering for luton .
neutral	first_impressions look interesting .
neutral	the proof of the pudding will be in the eating !
neutral	i did not realise the price you initially see does not include_vat , you only find that out at checkout .
neutral	a bit_naughty really !
neutral	i ordered two samsung tvs , plus 0d_glasses , back in december 00 .
neutral	the order was finally completed in april 00 .
neutral	i have had to chase them repeatedly to find out the current_status and reasons for delay , which was frustrating .
neutral	the reasons were all down to samsung , so not hispek '_s fault - but nevertheless a bit more proactivity would have been appreciated .
neutral	i have not yet opened our shower_screen as i await my fitters who will arrive either tomorrow or monday , but the packaging was damaged in two places .
neutral	hopefully the screen will be fine but i would expect an item that cost circa_£_000 would be treated with a little more respect .
neutral	as far as the ordering and delivery schedule this could not be easier
neutral	went for one of the keylite blinds and was much_cheaper_than those from the original keylite site .
neutral	however has 0 issues .
neutral	firstly , the ' how to ' video didn_'_t match the actual needed activity .
neutral	video showed a simple four screw fitting , where in reality there was over a dozen which became a problem due to issue 0 !
neutral	issue 0 was the quality of the screws and lack of !
neutral	the blind needed to be screwed into the window frame which is naturally a hard wood and needed a fair degree of force .
neutral	all provided screws rounded as soon as the mildest amount of force was applied making them unusable .
neutral	had to use my own screws without which i would not have been able to install the blind - simple as that .
neutral	i recently ordered some flowers for a colleague as it was her 00th_birthday .
neutral	i had asked for the delivery to be around 00 : 00 as the majority of our work team would have been together then .
neutral	unfortunately , they did not arrive until 00 : 00 .
neutral	which was a shame .
neutral	the offer is totally misleading .
neutral	i bought two beanbags for my two grand_daughters who naturally didn_'_t want to have the same patterns .
neutral	offer didn_'_t apply .
neutral	is that good marketing or bad marketing ?
neutral	i guess it depends whether you are selling or buying .
neutral	having said that the beanbags looked good quality .
neutral	wasn_'_t impressed with the flowers arriving in a box to be fair .. the bouquet didn_'_t really look like it did online and they didn_'_t arrive in style .. plain looking white_van .. 0 out of ten for me .
neutral	when collecting the hire car i was given 0 keys .
neutral	however they are on the same key ring which is welded shut .
neutral	so my question is why give me 0 keys if i can not keep them apart ?
neutral	then you are asked if you wish to take out extra_insurance in case you loose a key .
neutral	duh is it me or is this just a sales catch to get you buy the insurance !
neutral	i orderd 0 bags of hypoallergenic cat_food for my four cats on recomendation of vets they have been on this diet 0 mth i put order in jan 00st i asked if id recieve it thursday as was running_low and can only buy from vets or online .
neutral	was told that should be fine no_problems waited in all day thursday no delivery checked web link again same problem postcode not recognised phoned up all i got was should arrive by 0pm latest but with no cat_food left thats not good enough .
neutral	was offered a voucher but not showing on my account , spoke to mate who used to work for [_link_] he said company should of phoned [_link_] to get delivery estimate from driver for me they never did this so much for customer service im disapointed .
neutral	the tyres i ordered were out of stock , so tyre_shopper were great - quick to let_me know and offered the next model up for the same price .
neutral	fitting had been arranged , and when i arrived at the fitting_centre i was told it would take around an_hour .
neutral	i went for a walk and gave them an_hour and a half , but when i returned they ' d not even taken the wheels off my car .
neutral	it took another hour and a half of waiting before the job was finally complete - three hours of my weekend that i won_'_t get back !
neutral	the tyres seem fine , and the price was good .
neutral	i only wish they ' d told me it would take 0 hours so i could have done something more useful with my time .
neutral	pros_:
neutral	reasonable for the price
neutral	staff were friendly
neutral	cons_:
neutral	basic / old furnishings
neutral	noisy ( by air_conditioning units / kitchen and busy_road )
neutral	chef did not turn_up in time for start of breakfast time ( they refunded without problem and fortunately i had some food with me )
neutral	we decided to book and we were short on time , your site was really helpful but pricing was really high , we had to take it , we wanted to book the hotel ( crown plaza down town in dallas texas ), but we found it much_cheaper on other_sites .
neutral	yours
neutral	eslah
neutral	product was good and shipped out quickly once received .
neutral	however , it took a long time for the product to be sent from the manufacturer to havens and during this time there was no update given .
neutral	i had to call twice before havens had chased the manfacturer and finally got a new estimated delivery date .
neutral	orange gave_me a good price for my htc one x ( better_than most places ), and i was more than happy to do_business with them , but not so much when i got my quote back .
neutral	£_000 is good , and i expected that to drop by £_00 at most because of a few scratches ( very light ) on the screen .
neutral	but when £_00 was knocked_off for light cosmetic_damage and a bend in the right corner of the phone , i got a bit annoyed .
neutral	i still accepted the £_000 , because i really couldn_'_t be_bothered with the hassle , but seriously orange , you ' re blaming the fact the htc one x '_s design has a curved bottom on my inability to look after a phone i kept in near perfect_condition ?
neutral	tiny_bit_annoying .
neutral	overall a good service with prompt payment , but i feel a bit cheated .
neutral	they are very aggressively prices which is great but the delivery times are often an_absolute pain .
neutral	if delivery had been within 0 - 0 days they would have had a 0_star_rating from me but it usually takes a week and recently 0_weeks .
neutral	i still use them for stuff that is not time critical due totally to their cheap pricing .
neutral	bought a blackberry and after 00 . 0 months it stopped_working .
neutral	returned it to the local_branch who had it a couple of weeks then got a call to collect it .
neutral	on collecting it there was a note that they could not fix it but to ring a number at orange .
neutral	rang that number and new phone arrived next_day .
neutral	they got to the bottom of the problem so 0_stars from me .
neutral	item ordered via ebay on 00th_december_0000 .
neutral	item arrived after 0 days but was faulty .
neutral	contacted link delight and they spent a week making ridiculous suggestions before confirming that they believed it to be faulty .
neutral	they said send it back by air mail with a proof of posting as it is cheaper_than tracked and less likely to go missing in china and less likely to be held up by customs .
neutral	after 0_weeks i still had had no replacement and they still said it had not arrived .
neutral	i put in a paypal_dispute at which point link delight said they had received the grip and were checking it so i could cancel the dispute .
neutral	i left it and they eventually said it was faulty and they were out of stock .
neutral	i sent them a message as someone_else asking if they had stock to which they said they did so i asked them for my grip again .
neutral	they then said they were sending it .
neutral	i then found out the dispute had failed as i had not sent it tracked !
neutral	still not got the grip and out of pocket for the grip and the postage back to china .
neutral	would have left 0 feedback if you could .
neutral	i would love to be proved wrong about link delight .
neutral	they have lots of items that i would buy from them and i still want a grip .
neutral	i am a member of a large photography forum and people are watching this with interest .
neutral	added 00th_march_0000 - i really hope that my grip arrives as per the update from them below and i am happy with it .
neutral	i have spoken to many people who are happy with their stuff and their are lots of items that i would like to buy from link delight .
neutral	added 0th_april_0000 - the grip arrived this morning and works .
neutral	i am still rather unhappy about the time it has taken from_start to finish which is 000 days but it is here now and that is the main_thing .
neutral	i will probably use link delight again but will be sure to send anything back using signed for post in future although their stuff does seem to be of good quality and i have not found other people with the same problem ( which if it was a problem then i am sure i would have as i am on a large photography forum !
neutral	).
neutral	so yes their grips are good quality and yes it arrived eventually so that makes it a 0_star experience now .
neutral	i rang on sat as i could not purchase the furniture , only to find out the purchasing dept and online purchasing does not work weekends !
neutral	probably the busiest day of the week you need to be able to purchase goods .
neutral	trueshopping order no '_s .
neutral	0000000 & 0000000
neutral	ksig000000c is advertised with 000mm between pipe centres .
neutral	however , the radiator has 000mm pipe centres .
neutral	this is the second radiator delivered as distance on first was the same .
neutral	i selected this radiator to replace an existing one with 000mm pipe centres .
neutral	phoning trueshopping is a problem due to waiting 00_mins for an answer .
neutral	agent unable to discuss issue just arranged an exchange , and if still incorrect , a refund .
neutral	live_chat unable to deal with after sales .
neutral	have just sent an email with photos to kudox , manufacturer and info_@ trueshopping . co . uk .
neutral	regards , peter adams .
neutral	you have now started sending only dispatch notes with deliveries of your fine glasses .
neutral	why so ?
neutral	it '_s important to send itemised receipts with deliveries --- cos your online confirmations don_'_t always agree with the quoted prices / offers stated at point of purchase .
neutral	you need to tighten up the whole of this element of your offerings / sales administration pronto !
neutral	!
neutral	you could lose customers .
neutral	that includes me .
neutral	southampton short_stay priority car parking is in the ideal place for access to the airport and reasonably_priced but i had prebooked but the barrier wouldn_'_t let us in or out of both car_parks we had to call for help on entering and leaving .
neutral	we also thought the sign directions were poor .
neutral	i was left without knowing where my item was for such a long time .
neutral	it wasn_'_t until i emailed to express my concerns that i found out that my item wasn_'_t going to be coming for such a long time .
neutral	well_done .
neutral	the delivery was very prompt and the goods excellent .
neutral	thank_you .
neutral	i was disappointed to discover that , although the information material said that my car could be left at the drop_off point close to the departures door , i was in fact required to leave it at point c of short_term_parking , a couple of hundred yards_away .
neutral	since i am_disabled this was a considerable_inconvenience .
neutral	when i called the office , the woman_who answered simply kept_repeating ' well that '_s where you have to leave it '.
neutral	however the man who answered the phone on my return 00 days_later was much more helpful and did in fact leave the car as close to the arrivals area as he could .
neutral	east_midlands airport_parking is not disabled friendly .
neutral	it is not very easy to find a good deal on this website .
neutral	they are rare and you usually have a very short_period to make a purchase or a deal is gone .
neutral	the search_engine is limited as i have to specify what time i wish to travel , when i should just be able to put in the following
neutral	travelling from which country , to which country , date of travel out and date of return , then i would expect to be presented with a list of ferries and times , which ferry ports they are travelling from and which ferry ports they are travelling to .
neutral	as currently i have to go to each from / to destination enter all my details bore i can find what times are available and the cost .
neutral	flowers looked ok , roses looked a bit tired .
neutral	the delivery was probably the best part of the order .
neutral	i went for the free greeting_card - big_mistake .
neutral	the message i wrote was just printed in that back of a coupon and was printed in the corner .
neutral	you could have at_least centred the text !
neutral	the recipient didn_'_t even notice there was a message with it at first .
neutral	won_'_t be using serenata_flowers again .
neutral	could be wrong , but i thought a free capsule stand came with the offer .
neutral	this is not important to me and does not affect my decision to reorder .
neutral	my wife preferred nespresso which she says is stronger .
neutral	i use three capsules of " ffc " for a decent large latte whereas i used two nespresso_capsules .
neutral	i prefer the former ( ffc ).
neutral	i think it was a week from order to delivery
neutral	i spend over 00 min on the phone trying to sort simple issue with them , and at the end i end up with nothing what was promised .
neutral	the cs is terrible as they seems like you bother them as a customer who try to figure_out why the promises aren_'_t kept !
neutral	edit .
neutral	sp they get back to me promising to sort me our , here is email :
neutral	dear luke
neutral	thank_you for replying to confirm your postal_address .
neutral	i '_ve arranged for a letter and gift_voucher to be sent to you which will go out within a working week .
neutral	thanks again for letting us know about this .
neutral	if we can help with anything_else please let us know .
neutral	kind_regards
neutral	dean baker
neutral	waitrose customer sales and support
neutral	now it is end of working week and i still didn_'_t received anything .
neutral	they are like vampires , i spend so much time to sort this out plus phone expenses , all for nothing .
neutral	update .
neutral	so they did deliver to their promises and i received generous vouchers .
neutral	that being said still bitter aftertaste but im not upset anymore .
neutral	thank_you waitrose .
neutral	you are on your own .
neutral	the customer service is one of the most annoying and not so helpful .
neutral	they have good selection of product but you can get better prices ( free delivery ) elsewhere .
neutral	im sorry my feedback was token this way , very sad .
neutral	you have say you call me ?
neutral	i have spoken with jonathan over mail no over the phone .
neutral	i did gave you 0_stars because i cancel the order and you confirmed that .
neutral	but in reality it wasn_'_t cancel , thats_why i gave 0_stars .
neutral	the fact i decided to take it afterwards was matter of feelings for you , but wouldnt do it again .
neutral	and yes you can bet that was last time i was shoping there , awful customer service , good products ...
neutral	and yes you are right , i could just refuse the order and this review would never happend .
neutral	n vnsgvngjna
neutral	the printer_ink i bought was a lot cheaper_than the lexmark products but i could tell the difference .
neutral	one of the colours doesn_'_t print properly and when installing the cartridge it was dripping ink everywhere and that stuff is impossible to wash off your hands .
neutral	so not an amazing experience but i hate paying the crazy prices that lexmark are asking .
neutral	ordering tyres from these_people is easy and after_searching the net , i found to be the best deals , but if you need to return an item its a standard charge of £_00 .
neutral	i did hope they would send out the correct_size i needed and take the 0 i ordered incorrectly back with the driver , but no !
neutral	!
neutral	i even offered to buy the correct_size , and when it arrived send incorrect 0 back then receive refund , but no , £_00 to return
neutral	for several_years i have used the cewe_photobook system , originally under the jessops banner , and recently under the photoworld brand .
neutral	each year i make an a0 book , prior to which i make one or more small booklets using the same material , to ensure that i have correctly adjusted the image densities .
neutral	there has always been a problem with the images being printed much more darkly than what appeared correct on my computer monitor ( or what was satisfactory on my own printer ).
neutral	after much correspondence with the photoworld service team , it emerged that i needed to activate the automatic image correction facility on every image .
neutral	this is despite the fact that the default_setting of the aic is to be not actived .
neutral	i recollect in the jessops era that there was a specific recommendation that it should be de - activated for images which had been processed in an application such as photoshop .
neutral	this feature needs to be specifically explained to users , together with an explanation of what the aic is supposed to do .
neutral	i had to ask several_times before being told this .
neutral	following resolution of this problem , the results have been much more predictable .
neutral	after a couple of trial small booklets , i was very satisfied with the quality of the images inside my latest a0 book .
neutral	however , the front and back covers were still printed much too darkly , as compared to the ' rehearsal ', using the same digital files .
neutral	this is the subject of an on - going complaint .
neutral	at a more trivial level , the photobook assistant offers " helpful videos ".
neutral	when i complained that i couldn_'_t find these , i was told they had not yet been made !
neutral	this is piece of rubbish pr .
neutral	finally , which uploading one '_s files , the ordering assistant pops_up and asks for card_details .
neutral	after entering these , one can be left_wondering_why nothing else is happening , if one fails to notice that the ' continue ' button is out of sight below the bottom of the window .
neutral	only by actuating the inner scroll bar can this be seen .
neutral	a small adjustment to the layout of the ordering assistant '_s window would remove this irritation .
neutral	i am pleased with the product i ordered , but for the third order in a row i was charged too much .
neutral	i paid using paypal ( same for each order ) and was charged and extra 00 . 00 for postage .
neutral	i emailed explaining what had happened and they were quick to return the money .
neutral	what puts me off ordering from ffx in the future is this should not happen once .... never mind 0 orders in a row ( out of my 0 ordered i have placed with them !
neutral	).
neutral	shopped_around for a good rate of exchange but was surprised to see a high delivery charge added to the bill at the end of the transaction as it was not mention previously .
neutral	this rendered the rate worse than those offering free delivery
neutral	i had a kind of mixed experience with homebase , though i would shop with them again .
neutral	the website was bright , clear and easy to navigate , but the item was delivered a day later than the one given to me in an email and customer service wasn_'_t that easy to get through to .
neutral	the service is shared with argos and another company , i found .
neutral	this used to work fine , and showed me that talk_talk was slower_than all other services , but as a pensioner who does not play_games or illegal downloads it '_s adequate and the " price is right ".
neutral	it now does not work properly for me does not show that blue bar in the graph !
neutral	i had some problems with the assembly .
neutral	the hole centres on one arm was very different from those on the seat unit .
neutral	i had to resort to filing the holes in the arm and tapping the seat parts with a hammer .
neutral	i did not want to send the chair back .
neutral	unfortunately you did not replace like for like , even_though i gave you the part number .
neutral	consequently i shall have to employ a plumber to fit it .
neutral	although at first , i was outstanded by the contract price and inclusive minutes etc , i was left_feeling disappointed after a few weeks by the lack of network_coverage around where i live ( which is a relatively large town ).
neutral	people on o0 , vodaphone and indeed 0 seem to have no trouble with the network_coverage but t - mobile seems to constantly struggle .
neutral	food for thought - pay the extra £ 0 a month or so to get the plan on a better operator .
neutral	i have used quidco for about three years_now .
neutral	for the first couple of years everything_went well .
neutral	however since december last yeari have had a spate of declined cashback from a variety of retailers .
neutral	none of them have been large but i am now starting to question whether it is worth completing large pruchases with quidco if it is 00 / 00 as to whether the cashback will be paid .
neutral	there was no card delivered with the flowers
neutral	i paid for next_day delivery which didn_'_t happen .
neutral	flowers were delivered a day late .
neutral	tracking_link just said " order generated " with no further information even after the flowers had been delivered .
neutral	i booked on line and saved , the price was only £_00 .
neutral	the used a voucher_code from aa and saved again .
neutral	only draw back - make_sure you call your local_branch to tell them you wish to confirm the mot - despite my paperwork being on site i was not given the alocated time !
neutral	lesson - read the fine print ......
neutral	i was talking to a friend about the cost of receiving faxes from booking agents for my hotel , he suggested i tried soho 00 and could not make up my mind until i spoke to them direct , and signed_up instantly this is going to save me appox £_000 . 00 per year , best move i have ever made .
neutral	fowers did not in the slightest look like the picture and are very disappointing .
neutral	service is good .
neutral	i don_'_t like the additional_charges which you have to remove and the payment charge means you can never get the headline rate .
neutral	not good practice !
neutral	the site needs_updating .
neutral	it '_s a little dated and buggy .
neutral	i have constant log in issues which plague me .
neutral	large orders are often delayed by a tiny part with no warning which i find frustrating .
neutral	a recent telephone order was sent to the wrong_address in_spite of telling the operator the correct details .
neutral	the products are at market prices , not competitive .
neutral	design000 wins by having an exhaustive parts list rather_than being the best out there .
neutral	great service and fast delivery items were picked wrong but happy with them
neutral	i get a poor signal at my home address
neutral	very fast delivery .
neutral	however the protractor i ordered is quite flimsy and don_'_t think it will last long
neutral	i had occasion to write to them this weeks following a delivery of body butter which , i discovered to my horror contains parabens .
neutral	not something i expected to see from a company which suggests it has all healthy products .
neutral	they replied immediately , to their credit , to explain the use of parabens and offered a refund etc ,, etc_., otherwise i have been very satisfied with their service .
neutral	i shall decide what action to take re .
neutral	the offer very shortly .
neutral	my only issue is having received my order for two 0gb of paired ram one of the modules was faulty .
neutral	this module was replaced promptly
neutral	and is working fine the computor is up to full speed .
neutral	i used offtek as an_alternative supplier as they were the cheaper when compared to crucial whom i normally use .
neutral	my dissapointment is i have incurred £ 0 : 00 registered postage_costs ( as recommended by offtek ) sending back their faulty item , i would have assumed the postage to be refunded .
neutral	any savings gained are lost and otherwise spoiled aa acceptable experience .
neutral	to be honest i had given up on ever getting the money !
neutral	i can '_t even remember how long ago it was ( estimate is a 00 - 00months ) that i made the purchase that came with the cashback or who the vendor was , i think it was experian .
neutral	i only bought one thing that had this cashback built in to see if it worked before i started buying various things to find it was a scam .
neutral	well i logged in the other day and to my utter_amazement the cashback was ready for me to claim which i duly did .
neutral	i can '_t give any other info as this is the only experience i have had with the site .
neutral	i may give them another go now that i have my first payout and hope they reward me a little quicker next time .
neutral	if it takes a year each time based_upon my age of 00 id say they may get another 00 purchases out of me if they ' re lucky !...
neutral	easy to find the desks and cars at the airport , nice modern car and at a reasonable price .
neutral	however at the service desk they tried bumping up our insurance even_though we ' d chosen what we wanted at the time of booking and then they tried stinging us for $_00 per week for a sunpass for easy progress on toll_roads .
neutral	do your_homework here and it depends entirely on what roads you '_ll be using the most .
neutral	most tolls are near the airport and most resorts and villas do not need to use toll_roads for the majority of your stay to get around the theme_park locations .
neutral	you will probably spend a lot less_than $_00 dollar in a week but you will need exact change ( usually between about 00c and $ 0 ) at any tolls that are not staffed .
neutral	again , there are not many of these .
neutral	personally , as a courtesy measure , i believe the rental_companies should provide all customers with $ 0 to $_00 of loose change in the car so that they don_'_t get stuck on their first journey from the airport .
neutral	alternatively look into buying a sunpass at a supermarket ( eg publix ) and load it up with $_00 as and when .
neutral	finally we also nearly drove_away in an unsafe car .
neutral	we were told to pick a car in the mid - size_suv row with its boot / trunk open .
neutral	at the time we arrived their was only one and we started driving away in it ( yes the keys were in it ).
neutral	however , we later found out that it was unsafe .
neutral	some illegible writing was on the window but no other indication that it was unfit for use .
neutral	otherwise , the service provided was a expected and we will probably use dollar again .
neutral	just be prepared to take your time and to say no to ' the salesmen ' at the desks .
neutral	hi , these remotes are half the price of the originals and work well .
neutral	however the buttons are exposed and are easily pressed accidentally whilst in your pocket gangelling with your other keys etc .
neutral	went to drive off to find the door was open again !
neutral	this can not happen with the original genuine remotes as they have a sliding cover over the buttons .
neutral	i guess you get what you pay for .
neutral	the small burner on the £_00 . 00 kit does not work properly , the charcol does not burn as required .
neutral	it was suggested i put small stones in the bottom , great ... but a bit_messy when you want to re - use them .
neutral	the design needs changing as it '_s rather difficult to drill_holes in a round metal surface .
neutral	they are good in terms of service , for example the deliveries came fast and the registration was quick and simple , so i would recommend it , although i hate to say that envirofone are better in terms of value , but either way both sites rip you off as this one does even more , but as there is nothing people can do about this ( apart_from leave your site when they see the value of the phone on your site ) my overall opinion would be that this website is a good one to use to sell your phone .
neutral	i took_advantage of a free delivery offer to buy a sale item - a waterproof_jacket that was very good value .
neutral	i also needed a new work belt ( again good value at £_00 ) but my size was out of stock , with a note to say call for details .
neutral	when i called the lady_who answered was very helpful but informed me that as the free delivery offer applies only to web orders , if i wanted to buy the belt it would have to be separately with a £ 0 carriage cost ... adding over 00_% to the price .
neutral	needless to say i didn_'_t bother !
neutral	a good system for windows 0 but since upgrading to windows 0 have i found the active x 0 that is used with this system is not compatible with windows 0 and looses the connection a lot
neutral	hi .
neutral	i dont_know but flowers were not fully bloomed , only 0 were fully grown , 0 had to go in bin . i was not over excited .
neutral	the wife still gave_me a kiss so thats done the trick , thanks .
neutral	cant_knock the service , but the usn igf0 protein is terrible to mix , bought for the first and last time .
neutral	recently_purchased a charging dock and a car dock for a samsung_galaxy_s0 , the price was very competative .
neutral	the delivery although free took a lot longer_than i expected , i would have either considered paying for faster delivery or buying elsewhere had i known the actual delivery time .
neutral	i was going on the site feedback which focussed on super_fast delivery .
neutral	both items were delivered by royal_mail and in courier bags , both items had damaged boxes which was very dissapointing .
neutral	the boxes themselves are made from very thin_cardboard and in my opinion should have had some added_protection before being sent in courier bags .
neutral	for this reason i don_'_t see myself buying anything_else from this outlet , i would pay a little extra to get the items quicker but the damage to the boxes just shouldn_'_t happen .
neutral	car was rented at rentalcars . com , and actually rented from hertz .
neutral	i ordered full insurance at rentalcars , but hertz only received order for basic insurance , and hence wanted us to take an additional_insurance of 00 euro '_s !
neutral	!
neutral	so adding up : 000_euro for the car , 00 euro insurance at rentalcars . com , plus 00 euro insurance at hertz !!!
neutral	someone must be kidding .
neutral	i did not order the insurance at hertz , and fortunately there was no damage to the cars at all , but i wonder what would have happened if there was any damage .
neutral	next time , i '_ll double_check
neutral	tesco is crap !
neutral	bought a couple of t - shirts - quality not that amazing but for £_00 not going to moan .
neutral	although no phone number on their site the email responses are good .
neutral	water on the car window wipes dint work balled front tires
neutral	wifi didn_'_t really work .
neutral	power cuts in villa .
neutral	cleaners didn_'_t come when they should have .
neutral	reps not v helpful .
neutral	there are much_better companies offering better .
neutral	i waiting feed_back ...
neutral	very good for some items which you cannot find any where else , but these are usually seasonal so not always available .
neutral	have bought milk on more than one occasion which goes sour before the use - by date on the carton .
neutral	the flowers were delivered on time however the arrangement was nothing like the online picture and appeared to be a bit of a ' rush job '
neutral	i had the items delivered by next_day delivery and did not get a tracking_number from them until i emailed asking for it .
neutral	well_done on getting the delivery to me next_day however lacking on the communication .
neutral	thanks
neutral	i '_ve had tyres_fitted at the same outlet twice previously during the week and been fully_satisfied with their service .
neutral	this time i booked on a saturday_morning .
neutral	not a good idea , there were only 0 people working .
neutral	they had 0 mot '_s to carry out and 00 sets of tyres to fit all in that morning .
neutral	half way through my tyre_fitting they abandoned them to carry out part of an mot that required 0 people .
neutral	took well over an_hour .
neutral	they also managed to damage my locking_wheel_nut remover as well ( not impressed ).
neutral	you ' d think with how simple it is to buy on amazon they ' d implement a similar system for sellers .
neutral	instead they have something which is over complicated and annoying .
neutral	for example the bizarre system they implement with the postage fees and the various levels of sellers which you have to be high up on to be able to even offer * free * postage ?
neutral	!
neutral	i don_'_t like buying from amazon market place either .
neutral	i generally only buy from amazon themselves or sellers who are fulfilled by amazon .
neutral	not good for amazon sellers .
neutral	having purchased items from local cex stores i bought what i thought to be a boxed set of skylanders figures from their on line store as the set was not available locally .
neutral	the image used showed the items to be boxed and there was nothing in the description to say they were or were not boxed , so i purchased the set on the assumption it was boxed , as images of other skylanders figures on the site showed them in and out of boxes .
neutral	it was when they arrived that i discovered they was not boxed but just lose figures .
neutral	in hindsight i guess i should have checked first , but cex could have stated online that the item was boxed or not , or better still use actual images of the figures rather_than stock images from else where .
neutral	so be cautious when buying from their online store make_sure the item illustrated is the item you '_ll receive or that it a boxed and is complete .
neutral	i ordered a pair of shoes which were on sale at a very good price .
neutral	list on the site as in stock i would have expected dispatch within 0 working_days however it took over a week before they were sent .
neutral	once dispatched delivery was quick and the product was well_packed .
neutral	i am very happy with the item but puzzled why it took so long to post out .
neutral	pity it wasn_'_t the complete delivery , delivered after working hours so i was home to accept which was great but still_waiting for the remainder of the delivery .
neutral	not quite sure what 00_hours delivery means anymore .
neutral	great prices but they always have stock problems .
neutral	last 0 times i bought from cyclestore i got an email_saying the item i ordered was out of stock .
neutral	in the end my items arrived within a week
neutral	ordered an ehiem powerball 000 internal fliter and was sent an aquaball 000 filter .
neutral	( similar not !!!)
neutral	had to return it and it cost me £ 0 . 00p .
neutral	all_aspects of service excellent , particularly the car return system .
neutral	however although the automated_system for passing through tolls was very convenient the amount charged to my credit_card was very high and i have no information on the makeup of this amount .
neutral	reading feedback on the web it would seem admin_charges ( not declared upfront ) are probably the reason .
neutral	this is the one thing that could cause me not to use you again !
neutral	smooth and easy process to purchase tyres online at very competative price .
neutral	0 * for that .
neutral	the national_tyres fitting_station however was well below_par .
neutral	untidy , chaotic and seemingly unsupervised fitters .
neutral	had to return same day as wheels not balanced properly .
neutral	accommodation in premier_inn perfectly fine , as you would expect from premier_inn .
neutral	but i was misled over car parking , not only was it not where i expected , when i booked for car parking from the evening of arrival at premier_inn , it woul donly book me from midnight the next_day !
neutral	given i was staying only because i had an early flight , taking the car then was not an option .
neutral	so i had to take it earlier & pay for 0 extra hours !
neutral	i should have been able to do all of this within the one booking .
neutral	so left with a bad_taste .
neutral	finally got my delivery from the us .
neutral	happy driver but 00 days late .
neutral	urgent stuff from friday still not collected !!
neutral	0rd friday this has happened .
neutral	liked the detailed product information ( so much_better_than comet ) but delivery time was twice postponed .
neutral	as a shopping_experience , it was really easy .
neutral	search is easy to use and i found what i wanted with ease .
neutral	checkout_process also really easy .
neutral	all this i would expect as its automated .
neutral	my main issue is that there is a section that asks if there are any special instructions which i completed to say " when delivering , if no one in - leave round side of house ".
neutral	this was ignored ( according to the courier it wasnt passed on to them ) and meant that because i missed the courier by only 00_minutes , i had to chase him around town to get my parcel off him before it went back to the depot .
neutral	when paying £_00 for a next_day delivery i expected at_least an adherance to my request .
neutral	i placed an order for new customer super lean pack and ordered 00 packs of protein_crisps as on special_offer for 0 pounds instead of 00 .
neutral	order came on time and food looked great ( chicken_breasts are twice the size of tesco !
neutral	), but no crisps and no luxury meat seasoning , despite them being on the packing list .
neutral	when i contacted them , they answered straight_away , but only offered refund and said they can '_t send missing items as don_'_t have packaging small enough ?!?
neutral	i don_'_t recall seeing anything on their website about having to order enough products to fill a certain size box , but ...
neutral	the refund was paid instantly , but i am disappointed that they didn_'_t make more of an effort to send missing items or at_least offer them at same price on my next order or free with next order as an_apology .
neutral	any other company i have used in the past have sent the missing items straight_away , after all , it is their mistake .
neutral	i would probably use them again as the products are great , but left a little disappointed by their customer service .
neutral	the only reason i have marked them down is because of the missing items , the meat received is great though .
neutral	lots of info on the website about next_day delivery etc , but by the time the order is placed and paid for - only then do you find out ' delivery in 0 - 0_weeks '.
neutral	not easy to plan for and they have your money !
neutral	many options were available and it was easy to book a hostel for my travels .
neutral	i have and will recommend to others hostelbookers . com
neutral	i ordered a data cabinet from kenable - had to order 0 times as the first two i selected paypal as the payment type and nothing turned_up .
neutral	third time i used credit_card and it turned_up next_day - but slightly_bent !!
neutral	!
neutral	overall good but wasn_'_t very happy about the part getting phone there by a certain time as it may reduce the amount .
neutral	but part from that it been a ok experience
neutral	delivery tracker was useless , flowers arrived without sender name , on same day of delivery flowers prize shown on web_site at cheaper prize
neutral	very easy to use and very efficient .
neutral	i went for an upgrade to a deluxe_bouquet for an extra £ 0 but was overall disappointed by the flowers that arrived .
neutral	they looked tired and smaller than i would have expected
neutral	free delivery was offered but maybe that meant smaller bouquet
neutral	the experience was fine but the only down_side is that there was no paper recipt sent with my boots , other than that it was fine . have emailed them twice for a printed recipt to be sent out by post but nothing yet , so the jury is still out .
neutral	we bought a toilet_roll holder and soap_dish , both in chrome .
neutral	the quality of both items was good and the price around what other_suppliers were asking for similar products of the same quality .
neutral	the only_downside was that qs_supplies charged packing and postage for each item .
neutral	other_suppliers do not do this , and offer a cheaper option when purchasing multi items .
neutral	the online experience was good but although we paid for next_day delivery it took a few_days to come through and only after we had chased the carrier
neutral	been using tcb for a few_years_now and saved a fair_amount of money however there appear to be a few companies that seem reluctant to pay up although they entice you with seemingly good deals so check the reviews and make up your own mind .
neutral	went for an on line oil_change and filter ...£ 00 which was very good , fully_synthetic castrol oil .
neutral	i also wanted a slow_puncture repaired under their free offer but unfortunately they had run out of patches .... so have to go back later in the week .
neutral	courteous and friendly staff and will not_hesitate to use them again ..
neutral	geneva is expensive place to hire compared with many other european locations .
neutral	the pick and drop is a stressful experience as a short bus_ride is required , the bus is often over crowded and runs every 00_mins , so need to allow at_least 0 / 0 hour for the drop_off .
neutral	the car_hire company never quote all inclusive price for example , we had to pay £_00 for winter_tyres
neutral	os_produtos são variados e têm qualidade .
neutral	o_serviço_de_entrega é deficiente por haver trocas de morada constantemente .
neutral	i think your sales_team need to be very clear regarding how the furniture is delivered and the amount of packaging you are left with to disposed of .
neutral	also the beds are to be put_together which we were not told about .
neutral	these goods were ordered on 00 feb and delivery is not now scheduled until 00 mar .
neutral	no telephone_call was made to schedule the delivery and the order did not show on the tracking_system despite the correct tracking code being entered .
neutral	flat_packs took several hours to assemble and a journey to the refuse centre to dispose of all the cardboard / packaging .
neutral	despite this good solid furniture .
neutral	excellent sales and communication .
neutral	we ordered two bathroom_suites with better_bathrooms three_quarters of it arrived damaged .
neutral	better_bathrooms replaced all goods with a limited amount of fuss .
neutral	but how they run a company with so much damaged goods of which they don_'_t want returned , i just don_'_t understand .
neutral	it makes me wonder_how long the products will lady .
neutral	products look good now they are in place .
neutral	bought an eames replica ' hang it all ' coat_rack .
neutral	delivery was pretty prompt and product is nice albeit the very vibrant coloured balls that form the key feature of the coat_rack lack colour .
neutral	perhaps due to carelessness in manufacturing .
neutral	bit disappointed that carrier can '_t find my address and delivers to wrong_address .
neutral	then i have to phone them and wait 00_minutes to be put through to an agent to handle my query , so that i can explain that the package not delivered to me but somewhere_else .
neutral	the agent at city_link was however very professional and courteous .
neutral	then i '_m informed it '_s a telephone_call to an 00000 number that i must pay for !!
neutral	not good .
neutral	products okay but a little better communication during order processing would have been good , i was on the brink of calling for an update , if i could have found the number i would have done .
neutral	the website is easy to use and the prices are good .
neutral	the postage could be quicker
neutral	would '_ve give 0_stars but for really slow delivery .
neutral	great site , easy to navigate and purchase .
neutral	excellent range of perfumes and brilliant prices .
neutral	well_packaged but let_down by slow delivery by courier , it took a week - yes a full 0 days to receive my goods .
neutral	many sites offering free p_&_p to n . ireland manage to get the goods to you by the 0nd day .
neutral	maybe time to look for a better courier service
neutral	dissapointing after at_least 0 perfectly good glasses recieved in the past .
neutral	i have returned them for correction and await the outcome .
neutral	assistance required with erection of wardrobes and disposal of packing should be made clear by salesman and / or offered as a service .
neutral	jlp do it .
neutral	my wife and i live alone and are in our mid_00s .. we could not tackle this on our own
neutral	requested appointment for the sunday , received call to say that sunday was fully booked and would monday am be ok , agreed as had no choice as car was my work vehicle , booked half day holiday then received a call saying that the tyre was not in stock and would an afternoon appointment be ok .
neutral	so long_story made short used a days holiday on something i could have sorted by taking wheel elsewhere .
neutral	tyre_fitter was very good , polite and professional .
neutral	the website asked when do i want my order to be delivered so i picked_up 00 - the of feb to have it just before 00th .
neutral	it arrived on 0 - th !
neutral	i would have give 0_stars otherwise .
neutral	ilkin .
neutral	i used to have several phones via dialaphone and absolutely_loved the redemption .
neutral	it always worked_brilliantly .
neutral	this time i received a letter saying : " unfortunately , when we contacted the network to process your order , they informed us that their customer criteria had not been met .
neutral	regrettably , due to data_protection regulations , we ' re not able to communicate the specific reason_why the order has failed . please take this email as confirmation that your order has_been cancelled ."
neutral	i was in shock as what data_protection they were talking if my data was passed to phone provider by dialaphone now they can not get the reason of rejection back ?
neutral	i wrote them email demanding the explanation and never got reply instead i received another email_saying you order has_been completed successfully .
neutral	this made me think did they just rejected it before submitting to phone provider hoping i will not insist on it or they did not want to give it to me because i used to claim all my redemptions so_far and i do not look like a " money bringing customer "?
neutral	i do not know .
neutral	all in all i would recommend dialaphone !
neutral	bought a laptop off them .
neutral	£ 0000 .... money most definately not well spent .
neutral	i found pharmplexdirect online after viovets had put up the cost of the tablets i needed by 00 %.
neutral	pharmplexdirect were considerably_cheaper but when it came to the checkout i was hit with a £ 0 plus postage charge .
neutral	i '_m not against paying postage , someone has to pay it , but £ 0 for some tablets , by royal_mail , so not even special delivery .
neutral	now that is a bit much .
neutral	the rip was over 0 centimeters long and ( naturally ) some contents have spilled into the postal packaging .
neutral	however , the price was very competitive so the small problems would not stop me from using this shop again .
neutral	it took 0 times to book , was going to book with someone_else . plus price got higher on each booking
neutral	ordered three items and these were meant to be delivered at the same time .
neutral	only one item was delivered and the remaining two had to be chased up .
neutral	eventually one of the two undelivered items arrived but still the third needed another chasing .
neutral	at last the third item arrived , about a month or more after the first .
neutral	people at the rug_house were always pleasant to deal with and seemed_genuinely sorry for the inconvenience .
neutral	despite the problems , i would buy from this company again .
neutral	arrived fast but not all working wife not happy so i get it in the neck only 0 out of 00 working not a happy_bunny
neutral	i ordered several bathroom items from vp knowing that one of them was out of stock but due in within my required timeframe .
neutral	by monitoring the web_site i was able to watch how the first proposed in - stock date was moved 0 times !
neutral	at no time did vp contact me about this and keep me informed as a good customer service dept should do .
neutral	upon delivery i noticed that the shower arm screw_thread was way too short to fit correctly on a tile and dry wall board securely yet still allow a connection to the water feed .
neutral	it took three phone_calls , 0 emails and 0_weeks to get a suitable response from vp - all according to vp " normal response times ".
neutral	finally , i expected vp to provide all of the fittings for their products to connect to the pipework - not so .
neutral	i guess if you were employing a plumber to fit then this may not be a problem but it required me to visit the local plumbing store a couple of times to get the required fitments at significant extra_cost .
neutral	not a great experience which is a shame as the products themselves appear good quality .
neutral	the unit is small and light , good for quick cleans .
neutral	bit noisy and the dust tray is difficult to remove , the button release is too deep and have to mess_around a bit trying to push the release meaning dust does spill out .
neutral	i ordered a splash screen for a bath_shower .
neutral	it didn_'_t arrive within 0 days so i left it , only complaining at day 0 .
neutral	it was then delivered within 0 days , with an_apology to say there had been an administrative_error .
neutral	i ordered two tyres online .
neutral	procedure was quick and easy , but it wouldn_'_t accept my postcode .
neutral	i had to use another one nearby , giving a different address .
neutral	not had that problem elsewhere .
neutral	i was really impressed by the service and communications however unfortunately the product didn_'_t meet my expectations .
neutral	the flowers where badly_damaged , the packaging was ugly with soggy brown_paper wrapped around the flowers and the bunch was very small .
neutral	this could have been a one off so would probably give the benefit of doubt .
neutral	admin and delivery perfect .
neutral	the product a chainsaw had to be assembled which was a surprise but the real problem was that the pull start cord broke before it even started after about 0 lightweight pulls !
neutral	hopeless to have issues like this as the product has not been fully tested and developed .
neutral	i have had it returned and don_'_t want another one as this is a potentially unsafe machine .
neutral	they may have the cheapest prices , and do free delivery , but the order processing is slow .
neutral	it took a week to receive my order and i ended_up running out of medication for my cat so had to buy some to be going on with from the vet '_s .
neutral	i own a range_rover , the first man who came took one look at the damaged screen and told me he could not repair it .
neutral	he arranged for a replacement to be fitted , when i pointed_out the likelihood of rain he told me they would cover the range_rover with a canopy attached to their van .
neutral	when the next men arrived to fit the screen it was raining and they took one look at the range_rover and told me they could not fit the screen because the canopy would not fit over it ?
neutral	i then had to make an appointment to take the range_rover to the nearest autoglass centre , which was some miles_away .
neutral	they could not fit the new screen because they found some small areas of rust under the old screen , from this point the service from autoglass worked well and following the removal of the old screen and the treatment of the rust the screen was fitted .
neutral	if the size of the range_rover had been taken into account on the first visit and i had been asked to take it into the centre at that time i would have considered the service to be very good , as it was i was left_feeling frustrated .
neutral	this is obviously a top_class product due to its contents and price .
neutral	however , nowhere on the packaging does it give the dosage requirements .
neutral	it does say " do not exceed the suggested dosage " but it doesn ` t say what that dosage should be ??
neutral	this is the first time i have ever received an oral product with no dosage instructions , which i would have thought could be quite dangerous , depending on what was in the contents .
neutral	some idiots could easily take the whole packet in one go !!!
neutral	you need to add the dosage on future packaging to be safe .
neutral	clh .
neutral	i thought it was a twenty_four hour delivery although it was about 0 oclock friday when i ordered but still didn_'_t receive parcel till wednesday
neutral	the procedure in selecting the vehicle and payment was easy and documentation
neutral	very good , detailed and easily_understood .
neutral	finding the pick_up location was also not difficult .
neutral	however the time taken in initially completing the paperwork was long_winded , although the staff were pleasant .
neutral	we were told that the location of the vehicle and that someone would be with the vehicle to complete the inspection paperwork but after waiting ten_minutes i had to go and search for him and then had to wait further whilst he completed the checks on other vehicles for people who had " asked_him first ".
neutral	returning the car was also slow as we waited five_minutes for someone to inspect again and then a further ten_minutes as there was no one working the returns desk .
neutral	however the car we had was excellent and overall good value .
neutral	we ordered a massive roll of cardboard .
neutral	fast delivery , some damage to item by carrier .
neutral	0 / 00
neutral	chair was quickly delivered and exactly as_described .
neutral	watch out for the sharp_edges when assembling - i received a 0 cm cut from a sharp edge on the base whilst simply tightening the bolts .
neutral	kitchen designer was little more than a salesman and offered little input to the design .
neutral	he misled us on what was included in the price and appeared to try and profiteer from changes we made after the initial design .
neutral	he missed work that needed to be done on our electrical feed which involved unexpected costs .
neutral	however we resolved most of these issues with his boss amicably .
neutral	surveyor and fitters were excellent and we now have a kitchen we love .
neutral	excellent product .
neutral	however , i had to badger by email to get a satisfactory response to a failed component .
neutral	fortunately it '_s been resolved , but i felt i had to chase it all the way
neutral	i turned_up for pre_- booked appointment .
neutral	when asked which two tyres were to changed i suggested selecting the worst worn and then swapping them around so the new tyres were on the front .
neutral	i was told that this would incur an extra_charge as the removed wheels would need re - balancing .
neutral	this is crap as the balance was fine and as the wheels are not balanced on the vehicle , the statement is invalid .
neutral	i declined the option .
neutral	as it was , the two rear_tyres were most worn and the obvious choice for changing as a pair .
neutral	when i went to pick_up the vehicle , i went to the office for the paperwork and was then told your car is ready .
neutral	the man then told me i previously had the wrong tyres on the vehicle as they were 000 and they should be 000 , strange as the vehicle handbook says both are suitable .
neutral	as the vehicle was not in the car_park area , i then had to get it from the fitting_bay where it was still parked !
neutral	previous experience of different branch of this chain was good .
neutral	i will not use this branch again .
neutral	very good price on my nokia_n00 but other phones i have only go for under a pound , which i think is a rip_off
neutral	the bag came within 0 days then i posted the phone and 0 days_later i got my cheque
neutral	very good
neutral	not the best price for the phone was better websites which offered more
neutral	good variety of parts , but i begin to wonder_if we are becoming a victim of a monopoly , as recently the offers seem less favorable and lbs level of service cannot by the nature of mail order be provided .
neutral	we have used intrerparcel for over 0 years .
neutral	they are priced very competitively but i guess with that you have to expect a downside and these_guys don_'_t disappoint !
neutral	easy to use website offers all the main couriers at around 00_% less_than their own websites for ad - hoc deliveries .
neutral	we use them once or twice a month and their ups prices in particular are very good .
neutral	the 0 % future discount is a bit misleading as you have to join a shopping club to get the voucher - i wouldn_'_t bother !
neutral	technology is basic but is good / straightforward as you ' d expect so 0 - 0 minutes to book on a collection .
neutral	no urgency though as most of the services are next_day and you really need to book before 00am to guarantee same day pick_up .
neutral	problems 0 or 0 times a year with missed deliveries or lost / damaged shipments - mostly resolved in the end .
neutral	offer of free insurance is a waste of time so if its a valuable shipment you should get additional cover .
neutral	contacting them is a trial , they should know that using a premium number and long hold times doesn_'_t go down well with customers nowadays !
neutral	!
neutral	all in all enough goes right to keep using them ....
neutral	so i use magic_madhouse often !
neutral	upwards of £_000 a month often .
neutral	and to date they have been fantastic ( quick )
neutral	my last order they sent me the wrong pack of sleeve protecters ( it '_s a pain but not the end of the world so i email to ask what i have to do )
neutral	no answer to the order confirmation_email they send so i go on the web_site and fill out a " contact us " page
neutral	still no answer !
neutral	( 0 days_later )
neutral	so i decide rather_than call and talk to someone ( if that was the experience i was after i would walk in a high - street shop and buy my cards there )
neutral	i ' d cut my losses and just use another magic card retailer in future ( there are lots of other options )
neutral	then i received an email_saying " rate your experience with your most_recent order " so here i am
neutral	the parcel i sent to toronto was collected 00_hours_later than we were told ( with no explanation ) and was delivered to a depot in calgary some 0 , 000_miles_away and took a lot of time and trouble to sort_out .
neutral	parcel0ship helped_me obtain compensation , which took six_weeks , but i would have preferred the parcel to have been collected at the time i expected and delivered to the correct consignee .
neutral	poor delivery plus delivery team not the dates agreed in showroom
neutral	i personally prefer the previous model . i am happy to order etc on line but find the current model a bit convoluted and slows the delivery of service to customers . i have marked it acceptable largely beacause i am a long_standing customer and have good local_branch
neutral	the picture were darker so it ruined quite a few of them .
neutral	not really satisfied .
neutral	the shoulder rest ( order number 0000000 ) is fine and will work as expected .
neutral	however we ordered a collapsible model , and the label on the box said that that is what it was .
neutral	however , the box itself said it was the ordinary ( non - collapsible ) model , and indeed that is what the box contained .
neutral	there was very little difference in the price , the ordinary model is what we have used before , so there is little point in asking you to change it .
neutral	it is worth_pointing_out however that the box was wrongly labelled in case others have the same problem .
neutral	john huw davies
neutral	i ordered 0 seperate items although 0 of the items had two of each of them .
neutral	funny_thing is , all i received was the two items of which there were two of each which were sent by royal_mail in an envelope .
neutral	i understand that some things can be out of stock occasionally but i ended_up after waiting over a week just receiving the smallest items with no correspondance to as to the other items .
neutral	the only thing i did see was on logging on to the web_site that the other items were supposedly not charged and were at 0 amount .
neutral	even_though you are playing less_than the high_street , as much as i have tried to make my new glasses fit me they don_'_t seem to want to stay in shape .
neutral	so i think that for the next pair , that i shall return to the high_street and let the optician make them fit me properly .
neutral	i have used your service a number of times for the home_trial but not actually progressed and bought glasses .
neutral	on this occassion i did with a particualrly good offer on free second pair of glasses .
neutral	i ordered a regular pair of glasses and a pair of sunglasses as my free second pair .
neutral	the glasses arrived but i was shocked to find that both of the lenses in the regular glasses had come out of the frames !!
neutral	i considered returning them but to be honest couldn_'_t face the prospect so re - fitted the lenses myself having looked at how they were secured on the sunglasses which were fine .
neutral	fingers_crossed they appear to be fine having had them over a week now but not a good first impression .
neutral	great frame but the graphics are poor and messy
neutral	not very convenient as order was delivered in 0packs on 0 consecutive_days and was one order
neutral	i recently received e_- mail notification of dispatch of an autodispatch that had been set_up a year_ago .
neutral	but , as it transpires , due to a previous over order , i didn_'_t really need the supplements .
neutral	i tried to cancel , but without sucess as the order had already been dispatched ( and payment taken no doubt ).
neutral	i was therefore kindly sent a prepaid_envelope for return of the goods and subsequent refund .
neutral	it would be beneficial to both the customer and supplier ( reduce unnecessary costs ) if a pre_- notification of forthcoming autodispatch was sent to customers a couple of weeks in advance asking them to confirm or change the arrangements .
neutral	this gives customers the opportunity to cancel if they wish , or notify the supplier of a change of address or bank_account etc .
neutral	unfortunately the item i ordered was the wrong_size .
neutral	that '_s not anything outdoor can control , but they might assess the accuracy of the barbour size_guide and advise customers accordingly .
neutral	the people i spoke to on the phone were pleasant but the process for returning was laborious with little communication between warehouse and customer service which could be simple to fix .
neutral	ordered tyres on a thursday for fitting on monday_morning did not arrive in time had to have them fitted next_day fitting was quick with no waiting so all was forgiven
neutral	only set me £ 0 for me phone , feel like i been robbed for my chains !
neutral	without a tube and nozzle the vacuum has serious limitations .
neutral	it is also much noisier than it was advertised to be .
neutral	in terms of its lightness and manouverability it is good but the fact that it does not completely replace a standard upright means that a second machine is required to do corners , cobwebs and ceilings .
neutral	a major disappointment i am_afraid and not what we hoped it would be .
neutral	i ordered and paid for strimmer online not a problem .
neutral	it said collect in store next_day at 00pm onwards , this turned_out not to be true .
neutral	the girl on collections desk was absolutely_brilliant in that as there was no paperwork to mention i was collecting the strimmer from 00pm onwards , she had to phone round and chase up paperwork only to not get anywhere , but luckily there was a strimmer in stock and she was able to sort something out for me .
neutral	luckily i had taken a copy of my online transaction , the information on that helped her to sort everything out .
neutral	my advice if ordering online to collect in store give it at_least one working day before collecting .
neutral	companies shouldn_'_t promise if they can '_t deliver .
neutral	i ordered some stuff a while ago it took nearly 00 days to arrive and needed the stuff for a gig so put me in a compromising position !
neutral	i would use again if delivery times improved
neutral	i opted for the argos_voucher , was sent q card with the balance to be activated , the number to activate it is a dead tone ... not sure what to do next to be honest but i no_longer have the phone or any money ...
neutral	on arrival at the desk at pisa_airport with a document saying fully paid i was asked to take out further insurance that i assumed had already been paid this put the hire charge over £_000 i still feel slightly ripped of as i could not understand the language youre comments might clear this up ??

neutral	ivor
neutral	i was nervous in ordering from this company , having read multiple negative_reviews , but then also multiple positive_reviews .
neutral	so it seemed to be a bit of a lottery .
neutral	however at the time , simply_electronics offered a singificantly lower price than any other retailer , so i went_ahead , by credit_card , and was prepared for a bit of a battle if needed .
neutral	the item was showing as " in stock " on the day of order , and every day thereafter until delivery .
neutral	i ordered via_google_checkout to try and speed things through .
neutral	i requested a status update on day 0 , via my google_checkout account , and received an email ( likely a generic , copy n paste type response ) within an_hour from one of the customer_services executives .
neutral	they assured me the order was placed and would be delivered as soon as possible , within 0 working_days of the order being placed .
neutral	sure_enough , my camera was showing as " shipped " on working day 0 , and was delivered via city_link on working day 0 .
neutral	i think what made me nervous throughout this process was that my money was taken straight_away , but no estimated delivery date was provided , other than a vague assurance from the customer_services team there .
neutral	would i order again ?
neutral	probably not - for the sake of a few_quid , i like the security of amazon .
neutral	however , i certainly did not experience a horror story like others seem to have done on here .
neutral	good easy website when booking , but everything from food and drink to wifi well overpriced .
neutral	shambolic situation at 0st dinner sitting when no - one knew where to sit .
neutral	placing table numbers on the tables would help !
neutral	why oh why does it take so long to get on and off the ship with a vehicle - especially when there are children in the car ?
neutral	it doesn_'_t take a fraction of the time on the dover - calais ferries .
neutral	good product but took an age to arrive .
neutral	they have a great selection of products at very competitive_prices .
neutral	the web_site is a bit_clunky , and some of the functionality is a bit crude .
neutral	i ordered two items that were delivered without a problem and very promptly .
neutral	i also had one alarming experience where i received an email_informing_me that i an order of glasses had been dispatched and was on it '_s way .
neutral	the company confirmed that i had not placed the order .
neutral	no money was taken no order dispatched .
neutral	paddocks are more_expensive than craddocks and customer service is not quite as good but on th plus_side they ' re not out of stock as often .
neutral	but with craddocks they tell you if they are .
neutral	in this day and age with technology the way it is .... it really is unacceptable to make people wait all day for a delivery .
neutral	delivery at 0 o ' clock is not good enough unless i '_m told beforehand .
neutral	if i went to the garage ( freezer is housed in there ) i would have to check the front_door for delivery as these_people barely wait long enough for you to actually get to the front_door .
neutral	i '_ve missed no end of deliveries when i '_ve been in ... to find a post - card saying sorry you were out .... well guess_what ...
neutral	i wasn_'_t .
neutral	lost some of the feet for the wire racks in our microwave .
neutral	buyspares had just the thing - but very expensive ( i think ) - hence only 0_stars .
neutral	service was excellent and delivery was very quick .
neutral	if it had '_t been for the price i would have clicked 0_*.
neutral	ok do ehat they say on the tub
neutral	website was difficult to manouvre around .
neutral	in particular when i tried to arrange an mot booking the site showed in the shopping_basket as 0 brake check , 0 mot ( as requested ).
neutral	when i tried to edit and remove the tick_box to eliminate the brake check it kept coming_back once edited as still showing the brake check as included which i did not request .
neutral	!
neutral	i tried on three occasions to go out of the site and log back on but each time it remembered the original request !
neutral	i then called the national telephone_number and a helpful lady said she would get someone to call me back in the morning .
neutral	i tried once more and after finding myself at the shopping_basket menu i then emptied the basket and tried again , which worked eventually !
neutral	not a good experience !
neutral	!
neutral	good price for lights compared to other_sites ; paid for faster deliver but didn_'_t arrive in timeframe .
neutral	phoned to be told items dispatched the day before and given tracking code .
neutral	received email with different tracking code not related to my order .
neutral	both orders eventually delivered - mine as i have the items the other because i got an email_telling_me , i assume the second arrived at the correct address !
neutral	hi we only brought this as a gift for our anervirsey and to make our flat look better
neutral	photobook was ok . not bad .
neutral	but not great !
neutral	i bought it with a voucher for £_00 .
neutral	had i paid the full price of £_00 i would have been extremely disappointed .
neutral	the pictures where too grainy for my liking and some were very dark and too saturated .
neutral	for £_00 i may get another but there is a lot out there to choose from so maybe not .
neutral	first ime this has happened , all the meat was cold but defrosted , which is a bit of a worry .
neutral	plus on an ongoing battle the delivery , after waiting in all day , the delivery was just_dumped on the doorstep , good job the delivery was late , because if it had been earlier i wouldn_'_t have checked with wg and as it was already defrosted and about 00deg c outside so where would that have left me , as the chances of getting replacements would have been slim .
neutral	it takes a long time to book and every time you book you have to re - enter all the details .
neutral	once booked the service is great .
neutral	i was impressed with the speed of delivery .
neutral	i ordered shoes on saturday and they were delivered on monday_afternoon .
neutral	i could track the order online although the stated time_slot for delivery was very wide ( 00 : 00 gmt - 00 : 00 ).
neutral	what did surprise was that the shoes , worth £_000 , were left on the front_doorstep following a knock on the door .
neutral	i happened to be in and heard the knock but had i not been the shoes would have remained there in full view ; it is a terraced_house with the front_door close the pavement .
neutral	the driver did not wait to see if the door was answered , leave with a neighbour or hide it behind an available large rose tub .
neutral	there was no requirement to sign .
neutral	this was my 0st order from cewe .
neutral	did not realize until pushing the button that i could have specified upgraded photo_paper .
neutral	emailed customer service & spoke to them next_morning ( before order confirmation received ).
neutral	customer service not empowered to make modifications to order config .
neutral	made to feel an_idiot .
neutral	photobook quality ok . gadget_show made reference to qr_codes ( to link to your videos ).
neutral	could not find .
neutral	my suggestion is cewe should review the order confirmation workflow , to help newbies get the best out of their product set .
neutral	as a book provider the site i go to regularly forgets you and keeps asking for id .
neutral	the books need to be specifically marked ex library and books marked very good have frequently been of inferior quality , but that is my personal experience , otherwise when they are operating normally they are a good service ... postage is cool and delivery sometimes needs to be faster .
neutral	i still purchase from them so first point of contact is essential .... remember me please .
neutral	merry_christmas
neutral	james
neutral	not bad service
neutral	no_frills airline had a problem with the plane divereted to manchester waited for another plane to take us to tenerife , was kept_informed at all times .....
neutral	like the service , get a bit_worried_about them being the only provider of this solution on the web and any alternatives aren_'_t really supported get a bit frustrated at the charges and feeling trapped , but the service is ok and make buying stuff so much_easier .
neutral	i use shopto a lot primarily_because the next_day delivery is so reliable no matter what time i shop .
neutral	my reservations are due to the clunkiness of the user experience ; if i didn_'_t know exactly_what i was shopping for i am sure it would be worse .
neutral	recently they changed the security of the store , which is encouraging but it meant delays to my ordering , there was no early warning - an advance email would have been nice .
neutral	overall good , but not the best experience in the world .
neutral	i still shop their a lot though , so they must be doing something right :-)
neutral	good prices , fast delivery but arrived slightly_damaged and not brilliantly_packaged .
neutral	however ... due to my time_constraints i accepted as was and didnt / havent complained ... maybe i should have ...
neutral	well i ordered a subwooffer cable late one night after reviwing various other_sites mainly_because they had a short length cable i required as some other_sites only had cables that were far to long for my needs anyway lo and behold it arrived by post 00_hours_later needless to say i was delighted at the service
neutral	advertises payment same day until they receive phone and email_saying payment will take another week to clear
neutral	most goods are good quality and reasonably_priced .
neutral	have noticed that veg are expensive compared to local green grocers
neutral	purchased on line and was encourage to add further items to achieve free delivery .
neutral	placed order then found that i was charged additional delivery as over 00_kg .
neutral	attempted to stop and tried telephone but they had shut_down before the 0pm closure time .
neutral	not good impressions , but next_day they rang and agreed cancellation of extra delivery .
neutral	chemist_direct need to review their ordering_process on line to ensure this does not happen again .
neutral	we use them quite regularly on trips from palma_airport to port andratx and , historically , the overall experience has_been very good , particularly for the price .
neutral	however , our two most_recent trips have been a bit painful .
neutral	i arrived at palma and boarded the bus at about 00 : 00 .
neutral	we left at about 00 : 00 , which was ok , in a large coach about 0 / 0 full .
neutral	we were progressing quite well as far as magaluf but then we had to go to the further hotel away from magaluf ( 00_mins each way in the bus ) and then did the same after perguera .
neutral	i eventually arrived in port andratx at 00 : 00 a full 0 hours after leaving the airport ( it is 00_mins in a taxi ).
neutral	when i hire a car and catch the same flight i actually arrive at my destination at 00 : 00 !
neutral	even accepting that the wait at the airport is advertised at upto an_hour then if we had left palma at 00 : 00 i would not have arrived until 00 : 00 ( 0 hours and 0 minutes on the bus after a 0 hour flight !
neutral	).
neutral	my wife had a similar experience 0 days_later .
neutral	if this is going to be the ongoing length of transfer then we will need to think again and possibly go back to the taxi or a hire car despite the extra_cost .
neutral	i would_gladly pay more for a smaller coach and a speedier transfer as this is just getting too long .
neutral	on this occasion the transfer was estimated at 00_mins ( a lot more than the 0 hours 0 minutes actual journey time ).
neutral	please review the transfers and see if the times can be reduced , even if it means offering a service between private vehicle and the bus e . g .
neutral	minibus at twice the price to limit the drops ?
neutral	i ordered believing the item to be in stock but after it failed to arrive , several days after the advertised delivery date , i phoned to be advised that the item was a special order and would take longer .
neutral	i had arranged for an electrian to fit it so had to reschedule .
neutral	my issue really is that the website should have made it clear that the item was a special order and given me an eta for actual delivery as i would still have ordered it from them and arranged the fitting accordingly .
neutral	this experience will not stop me from using them again but i will probably phone unless the website is very clear about availability and delivery
neutral	there were many pieces in this self - assembly project .. too many !
neutral	there were no written instructions just diagrams and arrows hence it wasvery easy to make_mistakes .
neutral	i am a competent_diyer but i was not able to assemble the wardrobe in the one hour time allocation ... 0 days_later i have finally just got the doors on !
neutral	the showroom experience was exemplary with the help of a charming no pressure salesman .
neutral	the product is just what we wanted ( a large cd cabinet ) .
neutral	the delivery was well_organised , prompt and smooth .
neutral	on examination there is a fault wth the alignment of the doors affecting the magnetic_catches which do not meet .
neutral	when my wife asked politely and deferentially if someone ( a technician ) could call and remedy the problem she was firstly stonewalled then instructed to provide photographic_evidence via a camera phone download and when she graciously pointed_out we do not have the expertise or the facility to provide this evidence the unhelpful individual became abusive and ridiculed her stating management of the company would decide_whether a visit was necessary based on the evidence we must provide . with the help of our son ( we are a retired couple and computer novices who simply require patience and assistance which is sadly_lacking on this occasion ) we have forwarded the required pictorial evidence ..
neutral	it is fair to say the product in every other respect is excellent , shame about the after sales service with a sneer .
neutral	ordered from website , simple to use and seemed a good price .
neutral	picture of an arrangement looked great , paid for a size upgrade .
neutral	flowers arrived , rather small , not a true_representation in my opinion , not as dramatic or as big a bunch as i expected , a lot of ' fill ' flowers .
neutral	not sure i ' d use again based on that
neutral	too early to say . sorry .........
neutral	had a delay on my order due to supplier not sending full shipment so unfortunately had to cancel my order with them .
neutral	spoke with mark the owner a few_times all be it i had to ring him , for progress updates during the delay which in turn ended_up with a full_refund and apology from him .
neutral	they are sorting their customer_services side out with hopefully a little more customer contact .
neutral	i would possibly try them again in the future if and when i need a new stove .
neutral	darren
neutral	great service , they pay better_than other_sites offering the same service .
neutral	but it took nearly 0_weeks for my cheque to arrive !
neutral	the flowers looked good when they turned_up , presented in the spring bouquet just as they were shown in the picture on the website .
neutral	unfortunately most of the flowers either did not last more than a couple of days or failed to fully open before wilting .
neutral	i would usually hope to get a least a week out of high_quality flowers and was disappointed that not all these flowers performed .
neutral	i would be happy to rate you well but i haven_'_t received the goods yet even_though i paid for one of them them on the 00th of april and the other on the 00th of april - i have had no contact to say the items have been delayed or they have delayed one to send both together , so until they arrive i have no quality or other comment to make
neutral	i found purewell on the web and was amazed they were doing my dyson_vacuum £_00 cheaper_than amazon .
neutral	placed my order on their site , was advised in stock and would be delivered the next wroking day if ordered before 00 .
neutral	received confirmation emails of order accepted , text from courier company advising date of delivery etc so all very good up to this point .
neutral	then received a text from courier company on the morning of the delivery stating they had not received my item so would not be delivering today ?
neutral	called purewell direct to find out what was happening and was advised my item was not in stock and i would have to wait another two_days before the new stock arrives in .
neutral	i dont understand_why purewells stock system can accept an order if not in stock and then notneven advise a customer if it is out of stock or how no one from purewell contacted me to advise me my item paid for was not in stock ?
neutral	however , once my item was back in , delivery was the next_day so all ended ok even_though i ordered on a sat and received the following thursday .
neutral	i would of given 0_stars if not for their stock systems and lack of communication issues .
neutral	ordered belfast_sink and waste two_weeks before i needed it , after a week no dispatch confirmation so contacted on phone to be told the sink was out of stock and not due for another month . changed order to similar item and was with me in four days . my only_gripe is that i was not informed of the first item being out of stock , when order was changed everything was fab .
neutral	after fitting my new kitchen , me and my better half popped down to topps_tiles to pick our tiles for the finishing_touches .
neutral	we decided on the zanzibar range , but felt at 00p a tile it was rather expensive .
neutral	so assuming the range was exclusive to topps , we thought we would wait_until the next offers came in .
neutral	unfortunately because it was such a good seller , topps said it would be unlikely that they would discount them .
neutral	after a chat with a friend of mine and abit of messing on the webb , bingo !
neutral	up came tons of tiles , 00p_each , massive_saving !
neutral	the only reason i gave them 0_stars is because the first courier accidently dropped the pallet and smashed the lot !
neutral	so abit inconvenient .
neutral	however , tons were full of apologies and rearranged delivery promptly , spot on and cheap !
neutral	great price , delivery and installation went perfectly .
neutral	but the phone_call following placing my order was irritating because the salesperson would not take no for an answer .
neutral	i should not have to explain_why i don_'_t want your insurance nor should my decision be questioned .
neutral	i appreciate you want to make supplementary sales and profits , but lay off the hard_sell .
neutral	i am not stupid and i know what breakdown insurance is and i also know i can get it far more cheaply than ao '_s offer .
neutral	the overall quality of the album was excellent .
neutral	all colour images were exactly as viewed on my computer .
neutral	my only_slight_disappointment is that three black & white images were printed too dark .
neutral	although they are passable , they are in my opinion too dark .
neutral	i have since printed copies myself and they are fine , so dont understand what the problem was .
neutral	the album is a wedding gift for good friends living in australia , but who were married in this country .
neutral	my only option is to include the three b_&_w images for them to keep with the album .
neutral	the speed of return was excellent , but i shall be very wary of including b_&_w images in any future orders .
neutral	good interest_rates but it '_s slow investing and not many new investments .
neutral	money should not be in limbo whilst waiting for drawdown , other_sites such as wellesley are instant and are also backed by assets .
neutral	reporting is poor and needs_improving .
neutral	money transfer in should also be quicker e . g use faster transfer direct into own account .
neutral	my view it '_s one of a portfolio of p0p sites intended to spread the risk .
neutral	decent service , unfortunately nowhere does it mention that customs roms equipped phones will be viewed as faulty .
neutral	i was waiting at my departure airport when i received an email to say that my car_hire reservation at my destination airport had been cancelled .
neutral	no explanation and no phone_call from rental_cars to explain_why .
neutral	after spending five_minutes listening to music while on hold i eventually got through to somebody who then left me on hold for several minutes while the she investigated the problem .
neutral	i was told that my rental had been transferred to another company and another voucher had been issued .
neutral	no explanation and no apology .
neutral	everything turned_out fine in the end but it was a bit of a tense flight wondering_if there would be a car for me .
neutral	i '_ll probably use rental_cars again but their customer service needs a rethink .
neutral	purchased an acoustic_guitar from dv000 an_hour before the next_day delviery deadline .
neutral	the guitar didnt arrive next_day .
neutral	when i called customer_services they explained that there had been a warehouse issue but it would be shipped and i would receive the following_day .
neutral	guitar arrived the following_day and is great , just wish they had let_me know that it hadnt shipped originally so that i didnt sit around waiting for delivery !
neutral	very nice 0 bed villa with pool but .... cockroaches appeared in kitchen after dark on first evening .
neutral	no pest_control sprays provided nor any other cleaning products .
neutral	advised that cockroaches are endemic on lanzarote but we weren_'_t warned in advance .
neutral	bought spray ourselves and after finding another in a saucepan blitzed the kitchen in and around the cupboards and flushed a dozen more of them !!!
neutral	a few more appeared over the coming days and were despatched quickly !
neutral	we should have been_warned and the local response was quite blasé !?
neutral	people from a neighbouring villa advised that there were at_least 00 people getting the villa ready the day of our arrival , which seems a bit_excessive , could it be that they were aware of a cockkroach problem but tried to play it down .
neutral	also the cleaners wouldn_'_t get_rid of a dead cockroach , they called for someone_else , but we were supposed to deal with them !!!
neutral	additionally there was no light near the bbq so we could not safely use it in the evening - disappointed .
neutral	playa_blanca very nice , good restaurants and service but no local guidance sheet in the villa information guide - odd and no help on this front !
neutral	service was quick and helpful and goods all in order .
neutral	a couple of issues : the l - sectioned uprights were not all at right angles and needed some tricky hand - bending to put them right , and there was confusion about whether the packs did or didn_'_t include bay connectors ( they didn_'_t , and extra deliveries ensued ).
neutral	but it '_s well - dewsigned and easily erected system of good quality and value which i ' d recommend
neutral	usually a good service but this time we didn_'_t receive a text_message or email to let us know when our delivery was arriving .
neutral	luckily the delivery driver new that if there was no one he could leave it in a safe_place .
neutral	i hope this was just a one off
neutral	the trophy was poorly made .
neutral	you can tell that they put hardly_any effort into the work , for example , the box was completely ripped on the side .
neutral	the star piece on the trophy can be told that you simply just glued it on , this made it look like you didn_'_t even make the glass part of the model .
neutral	when they actually glued on the star , it was badly glued because their was a lot of glue coming out of the side .
neutral	it seems really good on the website but in reality , it didn_'_t really feel like a trophy .
neutral	ankle_support unwearable as hard strap under heel
neutral	picked_up the car from nice airport - pickup was easy although it '_s a bit of a walk from the terminal to pick the car up .
neutral	firefly have their own area set apart_from the main rental car companies , which is easy to miss the turn to on your way back to drop the car off ( it '; s not signposted before the turning , you can see the sign as you drive past it - and if you miss it you ' re in a world of pain to get out of the rental car_park and try again .
neutral	not really firefly '_s fault i suppose - more the design of nice airport '_s roads - but worth bearing in mind .
neutral	that said , as they ' re less popular than , say , hertz , there was no queue ( for me ) to pick it up and , once in the correct area , quick to drop_off .
neutral	the car itself was an_opel_astra - perfectly fine but a bit_battered and not washed on the outside .
neutral	not that bothered but the windscreen could at_least have been washed .
neutral	took them a week to assemble the order , other wise all ok , goods as ordered , well_packed .
neutral	ordered 0 tyres planned weekend .
neutral	four hours_later got an e_- mail saying it couldnt be done as tyres wouldnt arrive .
neutral	so_far the lights appear great , however , the plug on the transformer had one of its pins misaligned so it would not fit in the mains socket .
neutral	i had to cut_off the plug ( factory fitted ) and replace with one i had in the house .
neutral	product and turn_around great !
neutral	the delivery was terrible .
neutral	you need a new courier service .
neutral	the courier was terrible , told me he came to my address to deliver .
neutral	i was at the address the whole time - he just couldn_'_t be_bothered to drive by .
neutral	i called the company and they fixed it for me , but no one could give me a reason as to why he didn_'_t deliver like originally_planned .
neutral	change your courier service asap .
neutral	don_'_t expect a smiling_face when you go to the tyre_centre to get them fitted .
neutral	i done a hpi_check on my car just_incase there was any_issues with the car and to put my mind at ease before folking out £_00 , 000 .
neutral	yes it does the job yes the car was clear with nothing to report but at a cost of £_00 for nothing to report i think is expensive .
neutral	could at_least give you 00_% back if nothing to report on car .
neutral	hotpoint htv00s stainless_steel visor cooker_hood .
neutral	one of the cheapest stainless_steel hoods i could_find .
neutral	thin metal but sturdy enough for the job .
neutral	one rear_light with sbc bulb ( small bayonet cap ) & three fan speeds .
neutral	quite noisy on top speed but it '_s cheap !
neutral	you can set the internal hood flaps to recirculate back into the kitchen or extract via a standard circular duct .
neutral	mains_lead only 0 metre long & no 00a plug supplied .
neutral	flat mesh filter with a circular carbon granule one on fan inlet .
neutral	its a standard fit & can be mounted by top , side or rear screws .
neutral	handyman skills required to install but no more .
neutral	the mainly pictorial instructions were abysmal .
neutral	i am an engineer so could work out for myself how it was mounted & configured but for someone less technical it would be difficult .
neutral	once installed it works well and sucks in food steam / smoke from the cooker below , blowing out non - smelly air
neutral	i would recommend it as an item that does the job but you get what you pay for and spending more may get you a better quality one .
neutral	i had nothing to compare it too .
neutral	i give it 0_stars as - 0 for instructions & - 0 for quality of materials .
neutral	have travelled with dfds a few_times , from harwich to esjberg .
neutral	up to the last journey encountered no_problems at all .
neutral	we was due to sail home from denmark on saturday the 00th of june .
neutral	unfortunely the ferry crashed a week earlier in harwich dock .
neutral	so the sailing date was put back to friday the 0th of july .
neutral	this in itself is fair_enough ( a quickish turnaround .)
neutral	my complaint is in the communication between dfds and our party .
neutral	at first we were told we would sail on time ( 00th_june ) then further inquires at a later date we were told another week_later .
neutral	all in all personal contact with us was very poor .
neutral	we asked what our options were and were told either a full_refund and find our own way home .
neutral	or wait_until the following week .
neutral	we were in a postion were we could wait it out , so opted to do so .
neutral	we never received any word of apology or recompense .
neutral	apart_from this encountered no other problems with dfds .
neutral	mr_r hunter
neutral	good furniture but delivery men were unhelpful and dropped furniture out side my house i had to carry 0 x 00_kg furniture into the house on my own
neutral	et utroligt højt kortgebyr ( mastercard ) på 00 kr !
neutral	som_jeg_ikke føler at der bliver gjort ordenligt opmærksom på ( og selv fakturaen nævner det kun indirekte ved at lægge gebyret til buketprisen ... så ser det jo nok lidt mindre farligt ud ?).
neutral	desuden er hjemmesiden sådan indrettet at det_er_meget svært at hoppe frem og tilbage i bestillingsprocessen , så_jeg 0 . måtte starte forfra et_par gange ved fejlvalg 0 . på betalingsskærmen ikke kunne gå tilbage for at se hvorfor at prisen med_et var 00 kr højere end jeg_havde regnet med , og derfor blev nød til bare at betale for ikke at skulle starte helt forfra igen .
neutral	desuden er_der 00 prisintervaller fra 000 - 000_kr på div .
neutral	buketter .
neutral	på billedet ser man buketten til ca 000 - 000_kr , så hvis_man vælger en buket til under eller over dette beløb ved man jo reelt ikke hvor meget eller hvad_man_får for pengene .
neutral	i ordered a nikon_lens and chose value basket because of the price and because their site said the item was in stock .
neutral	however , it was several days before they eventually confirmed my item was available as stock was being sourced .
neutral	once i received notification it had been dispatched it again took several days before the dpd tracking_number i had been given showed any sign of my item being sent .
neutral	throughout i kept in touch with value basket by phone and email and they were always there to reassure me - i had read some horror_stories on the internet about their service which was causing me some concern .
neutral	my lens arrived today , in perfect_condition , 0_weeks after my original order was placed .
neutral	was the wait and low price worth the worry that i may have been_scammed ?
neutral	probably .
neutral	overcharged for product on website , emailed query and was asked to provide photograph of product pricing label .
neutral	no further correspondence as yet .
neutral	updated - they have now replied and refunded the difference so i '_ve changed my star_rating .
neutral	yep tyres there as ordered , premises look tired toilet needs pressure wash and coat of paint , preferred time appointment as only one tyre bay , fitter had bad back some time taken to do change longer_than_expected they should have change rolls with others for day to rest his back or should be off sick not the cheapest price as per advert out side but suited my purpose for day not sure if torque tool used ... a little motivation for the crew would assist customer_relations and perceptions no friction involved so rating should be 0 * plus would be better
neutral	got charged for both normal delivery and fast track very expensive
neutral	great technical_support but sales don_'_t reply to enquires until the next_day which has lead them loosing 0 sales from me in the last 0 months .
neutral	placed an order as the item wanted was a great price and indicated as in stock .
neutral	turned_out not to be in stock ... the advised 0_weeks turned into 0_weeks ... then 0_weeks - we only found out by calling to check each time - so we had 0 call at the start and 0 right at the end , but nothing to keep us posted as the delivery date kept slipping - poor after sales service
neutral	mixed group of experience meant some folk probably got more out of it than others .
neutral	the experienced anglers took up most of terry '_s time ( the trained tutor ) perfecting their fly_fishing skills .
neutral	as a beginner i was shown how to set_up the rod , attach weight , bait line and hook and also how to cast which was really useful .
neutral	but would have liked more practice at that .
neutral	i also had a shot at fly casting which although interesting , personally i ' d have preferred more tuition on the basics .
neutral	how to test depth ( and why ), what sort of rod & line to go and buy for a beginner etc .
neutral	the 0 hour experience was over priced for a beginner .
neutral	considering the day permit for the loch was £ 0 , this isn_'_t worth £_00 .
neutral	lookout for the groupon deal - more realistic at £_00 .
neutral	with excellent quality food on offer , why oh why don_'_t sainsburys provide enough staff at their checkouts ?
neutral	my branch in frome , somerset often has queues of customers waiting to pay while staff are running around with earpieces or watching shoppers getting more and more frustrated .
neutral	no wonder the tills at asda are constantly ringing .
neutral	comfy sloggies
neutral	part of order was missing , awaiting missing part
neutral	great price , great availability but awful service .
neutral	let_down by their couriers - checkout allows you to leave delivery instruction , waste of time as the couriers do not read them .
neutral	my wife did receive the flowers eventually but no thanks to yodel .
neutral	i also emailed serenata about the deliver disappointment and have yet to receive reply or comment , disappointed but not to the extent i would not use serenata again .
neutral	check out other_peoples feedback , the courier service takes some flack , serenata need to kick them into touch !
neutral	however very happy with the flowers albeit received a day late thanks to yodel
neutral	good website , good delivery time but shoes did not fit_properly .
neutral	too_tight , not wide enough .
neutral	surprised that i had to post these abroad .
neutral	postage was expensive .
neutral	i will have to visit an ecco store now .
neutral	they managed to get product that was out of stock everywhere_else .
neutral	minor_niggle is that i only placed the order because the website said it was in stock .
neutral	very frustrating when website says in stock only for an email to come later saying the product is actually on order .
neutral	however they came through and managed to secure the product which was then delivered quickly .
neutral	as a frequent customer you would think they would eradicate the on going issues to the customer .
neutral	im not going to tell you everything is great as its not .
neutral	the only thing what draws me to dominos is the on going offers and the idea that if your pizzas are not right you can phone them up with out a great deal of hassle unlike the other competitors .
neutral	i '_ve had pizzas take nearly two hours before as well as under cooked and over cooked pizza '_s .
neutral	and how is it that i seem to get bashed up wedges and chicken strips , it '_s obviously had a beating before getting delivered .
neutral	keep it up dominos as this is the way to keep customers !.
neutral	not !.
neutral	i use interparcel for both delivery and collection .
neutral	the collection service is unreliable and unchecked and unaudited by interparcel .
neutral	i have several parcels still with clients not collected that i have paid interparcel for in advance .
neutral	interparcel will say " but we expect you to track the parcel yourself " call theft a good service .
neutral	if their tracking was reliable .
neutral	i would be a credible excuse .
neutral	however quite often a collected parcel arrives wit no tracking evidence that it has even been collected , sent to my depot or even loaded_onto a van !
neutral	to get a parcel that has not been collected ( and my irate customers have usually waited in especially all day ) is the annoying for them and for me to contact by phone , live_chat or email is a nightmare .
neutral	i outstanding non collections with the complaints_dept .
neutral	( lisa i think ) probably owing me £_00 + probably much more .
neutral	the 0star is due to a reasonable delivery service .
neutral	rsvp
neutral	unfortunately the christmas_tree sillhouette i recently_purchased was
neutral	much smaller than i realised and for the price was extremely expensive as
neutral	the same size silhouette can be purchased for £_00 . 00 at most garden_centres
neutral	who sell christmas_lights .
neutral	great overall service but as the survey is only valid for 0 months i had to do what they call a desktop re - survey .
neutral	again this was very cheap but i did have to chase for a couple of weeks to receive the re - validated survey .
neutral	the first order was very good , good price and arrived almost next_day .
neutral	after repeated_emails nagging me to re - order i did so , and after the order was placed i went back and looked at my original order and realised i had paid almost twice the price the second time round .
neutral	then i had to wait over a week for my lenses to arrive as despite them nagging me to order again , they had no stock .
neutral	good price but ...
neutral	0 ) bombarded with emails asking why i hadn_'_t purchased when i had .
neutral	0 ) no response to my email so i had to call
neutral	0 ) despite_being in stock it took almost a week to dispatch
neutral	not sure i ' d use them again - lots of hassle for a few_pounds saving
neutral	dont_know who does quality control on these rads but when blanks opened to receive rad valves edges on inside bit rough ie not smooth so need extra attention to prevent weeping . this should not happen on what is purported to be a quality item
neutral	bought some pre_- owned , almost new audi wheels for use in the winter .
neutral	wheels were shipped in good time , arrived by citylink in 0 boxes .
neutral	looked ok when received but on further inspection one of the boxes had been dropped on it '_s edge .
neutral	the packing_material in this particular box didn_'_t protect the wheel sufficiently and a large_chunk of paint was removed by citylink '_s mishandling .
neutral	paint chips were found in box .
neutral	contacted tyremen .
neutral	as these were pre_- owned , they had no more stock to replace it .
neutral	they said that citylink would maybe only refund £_00 , which will not cover the cost of repairing the wheel , claim that citylink cover items based on weight not value .
neutral	i asked them to pursue this but so_far have heard_nothing back .
neutral	assume that i won_'_t .
neutral	given that they send out wheels all the time , you would think there would be a better compensation mechanism in place to cover damage .
neutral	so i '_m going to be out another £_00_-£_000 to have the wheel fixed .
neutral	not what i expected for something that was done by a courier .
neutral	*********************
neutral	update_: 0 / 0 / 00
neutral	i have now had the wheel repaired and tyremen have refunded £_00 as promised .
neutral	this was an one - time deal and they did say they would have replaced the wheel if they had stock .
neutral	overall now satisfied with the outcome and would be happy to use them again .
neutral	delivery was perfect but the quality of the custome wasn_'_t worth the money a little disappointed to be honest .
neutral	placed 0 orders recently .
neutral	these one one was prompt but the first one was delayed .
neutral	paid for next_day delivery on 0 large items , but was called the next_day to be told that there was no next_day delivery on the items even_though the website accepted the additional payment for the next_day service .
neutral	was told that the additional_fee would not be charged , but the glitch in the website needs to be sorted !
neutral	have shopped with dp for over 0 years , but with expansion , the service seems to have slowed a bit .
neutral	the wing_mirror was as i ordered it was well_packed but took a lot longer_than the 0 to 0 days to arrive but i put that down to the bad_weather and was close to easter maybe
neutral	all the stores are generally entertaining and fun with a wide_range of media and gadgets .
neutral	the prices are very much average with little deals .
neutral	what puts me off about hmv is the postage sucks always late !
neutral	and the staff rarely help out .
neutral	but over all not to bad .
neutral	ordered assos leg_warmers .
neutral	site says if in stock will be delivered in two_days and if not , they will call me to advise .
neutral	well nothing arrived and no call so after me calling them , very helpful person advised not yet in but would be soon .
neutral	then another call to find that they had arrived and would be sent out .
neutral	to be fair they cancelled the delivery charge but better follow_up when goods not in stock would lead to better confidence in using again .
neutral	the shop is great but this mail order is bettered by wiggle etc .
neutral	ok as far as company '_s go got the part i needed in the end but only after having to ring up loads of times and then wait for someone to call me who never did !
neutral	having used mch 0st time around and had an excellent service , i was a little disappointed 0nd time around when the radiator i ordered turned_up on the doorstep ( at the time / date agreed ) but was then informed the valves weren_'_t available and would be sent out separately .
neutral	it appeared one office didn_'_t talk to the other .
neutral	the revised date for the valve delivery was ' wooly ' to say the least .
neutral	after 0 days of nothing turning_up i called hq , to find they knew nothing about it , but then said wait a couple of days .
neutral	a couple more days passed , and nothing arrived .
neutral	a 0nd call to hq with my disgruntled tone , got some action and they were good to send it out straight_away .
neutral	clearly the branches hadn_'_t communicated with one another here and i was the person putting up with the hastle .
neutral	i had to re arrange a plumber , not once , but twice , and make_sure i was in for 0 deliveries not just one ...... all a cost an inconvenience to me .
neutral	i appreciate companies may have teething_problems , but this goes to show that despite one great service first time around ( a delivery to my door within 0 days of order and good communication all along ) it can so quickly be undone , leaving me to remember the poor service .
neutral	i '_m sorry to have to write this review , as i was nothing but glowing 0st time around .
neutral	maybe some lessons can be learnt within the company so this doesn_'_t happen for future customers .
neutral	quite fast delivery .
neutral	problem when delivered .
neutral	the box was all mangled and the bottom on the bike was all scratched
neutral	i was booked in for an mot having used national several_times in the past .
neutral	as usual the workmanship and skill off the technicians were not in doubt .
neutral	however , i booked my car in for 00am for an_hour long mot , and didn_'_t manage to get away until 00 . 00pm or so .
neutral	if the waiting areas were more pleasant , e . g .
neutral	warmer , coffee_machines etc , it wouldn_'_t be so bad , but i found it a very long wait .
neutral	i bought some make - up for my granddaughter for her_birthday which when i received it was very nice .
neutral	i doubt it was ever the price quoted " but " i believe it was a bargain at the price i paid and i am sure my granddaughter will be pleased with it
neutral	two comments if i may : first conduct of courier .
neutral	she placed the box up on end in our doorway which was upside_down , rang the doorbell and left although my wife answered very quickly .
neutral	second the quality and amount of flowers for the price did not seem to represent the normal value for money .
neutral	as such i am_afraid i will be looking for an_alternative supplier next time .
neutral	but thanks for past business .
neutral	regards
neutral	james
neutral	the car was not clean and there was so much damage around the car dents and scratches etc a lot of marks was not on the paper_work i was handed , i had to call the rep out twice so he could correct the paper_work , if this is not correct i would have not receive all of my access , this is very misleading , the paper_work should be correct , i think for the future for me to use rental_cars again you should do your job properly
neutral	i paid £ 0 . 00 for next_day delivery and had to wait a full week to receive it .
neutral	it was a last_minute present but had to get something else instead .
neutral	however i have made use of the speakers i purchased and really happy with the price and quality of them , just a shame they came too late .
neutral	hard to see the products well and bit of faith needed that you are picking the right thing
neutral	order 0 tops on line .
neutral	took 0 days to despatch , 0 days to deliver .
neutral	not really impressed with the service especially when l ordered a £_000 camera from_hong_kong the same day and received in 0 days .
neutral	if you had of emailed me i would have known that my payment had not gone_through i was still_waiting for you to deliver the item but i was giving you a bit more time before starting a dispute case with ebay
neutral	cheap quick service
neutral	the process to purchase was extremely easy and my items arrived quickly through the courier .
neutral	i used the tracking_number given to track the parcel and found this helpful .
neutral	i have only rated it 0_stars as i think the £ 0 . 00 pre_paid return voucher that you may or may night need is a little_harsh , perhaps if customers don_'_t need to return the items then this could be refunded to the card .
neutral	failing that offer free returns and you might get more sales .
neutral	i bought two office_chairs and was impressed with the swiftness of delivery .
neutral	both chairs were the same and each was self - assembly .
neutral	one chair was perfect but the second identical chair was difficult to construct .
neutral	overall , i would not buy the same chairs again from homebase - i would choose another product instead .
neutral	this happened several_times but the last time it worked well .
neutral	it would be good to have a dedicated area for prepaid cars .
neutral	useful , have had problems with the connection too my bank once couple months_ago and now
neutral	having paid for item . item not received .
neutral	issue has now being resolved with the telephone con with the owner .
neutral	i '_ve ordered about 0 orders form exante 0 have never turned_up although they did replace them but having to wait 0_weeks when on this diet before they '_ll reissue them is rubbish , a maximum of 0 days should be enough especially as they use a courier company .
neutral	when asking for the tracking_numbers haven_'_t been given the information until the replacement orders have been sent , not good when this diet is supposed to keep you in ketosis , also some items i '_ve had only had 0_weeks or so until they became out of date and other items they covered the date label with a sticker , so not really that impressed with them .
neutral	the glow_sticks where pretty good i got multi colours ones the white ones are pointless the stop glowing after about 0 mins and all the rest say they glow for 0 hours but they are only bright for about 0 hours and then a very dim light for the rest of the 0 hours .
neutral	green ones are the best they stay brighter for longest
neutral	delivery and products are excellent .
neutral	but this is the second order i '_ve placed when the advertised " free_shaker " has not been included !
neutral	!
neutral	delivery was fine and everything seemed good until i attempted to put the flush together and realised the refill tube was missing which meant i could not install the toilet .
neutral	i called customer_services and they agreed to send one but it will not be with me for 00_hours which puts my schedule out completely .
neutral	my fault i suppose as should have checked everything immediately but as the bag was sealed i wrongly_assumed everything would be there .
neutral	also , £_00 for delivery is way too high , only ordered because this was one of the few toilets i could_find that will fit easily into my existing plumbing .
neutral	my tip would be to carefully check you have everything you need before you start installation ( luckily i did ).
neutral	we '_ve_used just - eat many_times in the past when we lived in watford .
neutral	they had a great selection of various_types of restaurant , and bar a couple of occasions the food turned_up quickly and correctly .
neutral	a couple of times however , the food didn_'_t turn_up , and we were told on the phone " just wait , give it a bit longer " etc .
neutral	after an_hour we phoned , a bit more willing to complain , and were informed that our order hadn_'_t been processed at all !!
neutral	i think we received a £ 0 voucher as compensation for our empty tums .
neutral	the restaurants involved in the scheme don_'_t seem to have much incentive to stay in it , as we were twice offered a percentage discount on our next order , if we made it direct to the restaurant .
neutral	now that we live in hemel_hempstead we haven_'_t used just - eat , as the selection of restaurants on offer is quite poor - just 0 restaurants to choose from , 0 of those pizza places .
neutral	i '_ve_used moonpig about 0 times in the past 0 - 0 years .
neutral	each time has_been an_emergency of sorts , such as a missed birthday or late purchase of a card .
neutral	the prices are high for a card compared to the already high prices on the high_street , although the opportunity to customise the wording and names on the card is a nice_touch .
neutral	i find the size and quality of their selection to be disappointing - the focus seems to be on lowest - common - denominator tat that people get excited by for a few_seconds , and i '_ve found it difficult to find anything a bit more interesting , or even truly funny and original .
neutral	cards received from moonpig have always been of a very high print quality , which is a definite_plus .
neutral	i have used play . com for over 00 years ( it was play000 . com back then ) and used to find them fantastic for finding rare or hard - to - find albums .
neutral	their prices were also very good - cds , dvds and video_games were all cheaper by at_least 00_% ( often more ) over high_street prices .
neutral	for the last couple of years though i '_ve seen a trend for their prices being the same as the high_street , but you still have to wait 0 days for the items instead of grabbing them there and then .
neutral	you can have next_day delivery , but that '_s at a cost of another £ 0 .
neutral	what '_s worse is they advertise rrps higher_than the price they ' re selling at , making out you save 00_% or whatever , when in reality they ' re selling at the standard price , same as everyone_else .
neutral	they have added various_departments lately , including clothing and sporting equipment .
neutral	on the surface this is nice for anyone looking for that stuff , but in reality i believe they have lost their focus on what they were good at .
neutral	buying things work fine .
neutral	but i can not get an answer to my emails .
neutral	website and delivery was great .
neutral	took a bit of sorting_out from the paper_work as was not too sure what parts tied up to the order , however , got there in the end .
neutral	some damage to bench top and one part was wrong but a drill and bolts sorted it out , however , if you are not practical would have taken a bit of sorting_out .
neutral	get the paperwork better i . e .
neutral	t - bar bench made up of items ..... and it shall be easier to collate the order .
neutral	having attempted to use the my t - mobile portal i couldn_'_t login .
neutral	i contacted the service desk and it took several days to resolve .
neutral	a few_months later the same issue_arose and again it is taking several days to resolve .
neutral	i would normally have a good time with e spares . but it took 0 goes this time to get the part .
neutral	if it had not have been for mr martin , i dont_think it would still be the right part .. very poor and cost me money . i will be looking for a fixing_kit for the same soon i hope it goes well this time .
neutral	my 00 : 00 appointment was cancelled at 00 : 00 the day before as they couldn_'_t get the tyres in time .
neutral	was told i would receive a call the next_day when they arrived .
neutral	was phoned at 00 : 00 , rescheduled for 00 : 00 .
neutral	lucky by boss is flexible !
neutral	turned_up on time and was kept waiting nearly 0 hours , was charged an extra £_00 for tracking and the wheels were left covered in black dust .
neutral	last time i had my tyres changed it only took half an_hour and tracking was included , plus they brushed the dust off !
neutral	not really going out of their way to impress here !
neutral	usually the first place i look at when buying cables .
neutral	however recently i have been less_than impressed .
neutral	i ordered a micro b usb_cable that didn_'_t connect properly .
neutral	i sent it back for a refund but apparently they never received it ???
neutral	also for my last purchase i missed an item off my order .
neutral	when i rang back an_hour later i was told i the order had already been dispatched so i had to pay another delivery fee !
neutral	not impressed
neutral	svp used to be a reasonably small company , but it worked well , you saw what goods they had , you ordered them , they had real - time stock control so you knew what was actaully going to turn_up , and in general it did , the next_day .
neutral	i used to order from svp on a weekly_basis , sometimes more , but in the past year their poor stock control , faulty item and appalling delivery has meant i have had to look_elsewhere .
neutral	sometimes things go_wrong , sometimes company changes causes teething_problems , but in this case there would have to be a dramatic difference before i would use them again .
neutral	tried to order head phones reviewed by computer active .
neutral	took over 00_minutes , very frustrating .
neutral	just acceptable draft printing don_'_t think i would use them again
neutral	hi , i recieved my order and was not to happy that one of the sd_cards was a class0 not the class 00 card i ordered .
neutral	we arrived at the compound at the appointed time , very early in the morning , to find it open , unsecured and completely deserted .
neutral	there was a tiny locked office hut , a very scrubby unsurfaced parking_area covered with gravel and sprouting stinging nettles , not a soul in sight and no luggage trolleys .
neutral	we rang the mobile number shown on one of the parked shuttle vehicles and we were answered by a driver who was apparently on his way either to or from the airport with passengers .
neutral	he came back to the car_park about five or ten_minutes later to collect us .
neutral	this shuttle driver asked us to take the car keys with us and after checking our car for existing damage on a pre_- printed chart , we were asked to sign it but we weren_'_t given a copy .
neutral	consequently , any other damage which might have happened while we were away could easily have been added .
neutral	on our return around lunchtime on a thursday , the shuttle was waiting on the pick - up road outside the airport but as we approached the vehicle he drove_off and left us there !
neutral	a couple of phone_calls to the ' office ' brought him back to pick us up about ten_minutes later , again to a completely deserted compound with no manned on - site office or facilities .
neutral	although we were let off the shuttle close to our car and the driver helped_us to load our_luggage into the boot , we were quite concerned_about the apparent amateur nature of the whole_operation .
neutral	there appeared to be no security at all and the fact that we were not required to leave our car keys meant that if there were a fire or any other incident none of the vehicles could be moved .
neutral	that also implies that none of the only two staff we saw was qualified to drive other cars .
neutral	although our car was parked near the airport and we were taken there and back satisfactorily , i feel that this business is in sore need of a little regulation .
neutral	they could try to reduce the price of their products .
neutral	the same products , with same quality and same standard , i '_ve seen else where sold for even low_prices , e . g .
neutral	such as india and even some european_countries .
neutral	i guess they are okay for british market ( as they appear to have lower prices then their rivals ).
neutral	its not so bad , when you , think britain , is known as rip_off , capital of europe .
neutral	may take the opportunity to thank_you , for your kind and generous reminder , to my review .
neutral	i was asked by trustpilot to express my honest_opinions and not to bestow appraisal on anyone in particular .
neutral	i simply expressed general opinion of the state of uk market .
neutral	i would like assure you , that you were not target .
neutral	i would like to thank_you again for time and custom .
neutral	thank_you , best luck with the future .
neutral	terrible trip going out as the ship left calais 00_mins late and then hung around dunkerque harbour for about 00_mins for no reason , then when it finally docked our cars were still kept on the ferry for another 00_mins for no apparent_reason , all of this without a single announcement over the loudspeakers telling us what the delay was making us 00_mins late for a meeting , i will not be sailing to dunkerque again .
neutral	homeward trip from calais was first_rate and seemed to be run by a different company !
neutral	i only use dfds because they are cheaper_than p_+ o , on the outward sailing i could see why they are cheaper and wished i had booked p_+ o !
neutral	i have placed many orders with just_miniatures and maybe 00_% of the time the wrong miniature is sent to what is described and shown in the photo .
neutral	they then can be difficult to deal with in returning an item for exchange , and will not refund the postage for sending wrong items back .
neutral	want email contact details for breakers not premium phone no which i wont ring
neutral	waited 00 days and no delivery , emailed and was told the order had been missed , parts were put in the post next_day .
neutral	the guy from the counter , where we had to pick_up the car , was downright_rude and stupid .
neutral	i asked_him what it means " young driver " and he said : " you have to have your driving_licence for at_least 0 ... or 0 ... years , otherwise you pay 0 euro_per day ".
neutral	when we challenged that ( the correct answer is : if you are between 00 and 00 years old , and all drivers have to have at_least 0 year of driving_licence ), he became rude and dismissing .
neutral	and we waited for 0 hour and 00_minutes to pick_up the car .
neutral	there were 0 counters but only 0 people were serving customers .
neutral	most of the time i '_m able to connect to a server in the region that i want to .
neutral	and , if it '_s not at a peak time , the speeds can be almost up to 00_% of my regular connection speed .
neutral	although there are frequent times where it will disconnect when you ' re in the middle of something it doesn_'_t happen every time and some locations are better_than others .
neutral	i '_m a benign occasional hma user and the country that i '_m living in is pretty free so it isn_'_t a huge concern to me yet that my usage data is kept and handed_over to the us government anytime they want .
neutral	but that is something that a customer in other_countries might want to keep in mind if they ' re worried_about midnight black bag arrests or teams of american lawyers siezing their assets and then suing them for newly invented us laws .
neutral	everything considered it is a solid middle of the road product offered by an american it company .
neutral	draw from that what you will .
neutral	i have been trying to get my game sorted as my cards were not being marked and i could not see what numbers were needed and when anyone won the name was always blurred out .
neutral	plus i asked several_times for my points to be redeemed and still have had no joy .
neutral	it took a little_bit long for my check to come
neutral	going through the ordering_process online was quick and easy with cheap prices .
neutral	however , when you select which date and am or pm you want to have your tyres_fitted there is no certainty that this will be achieved . the tyre_fitter in my case , i selected to fit the tyres in the morning but they did not have them in stock , so i had to wait for the delivery of tyres which ended_up being in the afternoon .
neutral	it may be best to check with your selected fitter to see if the tyres are in stock before you choose am or pm .
neutral	i have placed orders with 000 blinds twice - very recently and about 00 months_ago .
neutral	on the first occasion the order was promptly dispatched and the quality good at the price .
neutral	recently , an order placed on the 00 th january was not received until the 00nd_february .
neutral	i didn_'_t receive any communication from 000 and only received an explanation for the order delay , after asking .
neutral	i understand , that the company do not notify buyers re dispatch .
neutral	the delivery date i was given was wrong .
neutral	while the product remains good , i would urge the company to improve communication with buyers and to notify of dispatch , with parcel tracking_information .
neutral	ordering from the web_site was v easy .
neutral	however , one of the parts i ordered was out if stock but this was not stated on the site , and only came to light when i called to chase .
neutral	customer service team i felt weren_'_t particularly friendly and seemed disinterested .
neutral	second part finally arrived after i called & chased again
neutral	ordered some prescription_sunglasses for my holidays but from order to receiving them took nearly a month .
neutral	lost my glasses in the post and we ' re hard to get answers from .
neutral	but eventually got the glasses very late
neutral	we booked through rentalcars . com as it was cheapest .
neutral	next time we '_ll probably pay a little more and hope for better .
neutral	arrived at pisa and there was no queue so we had the comprehensive sales_pitch to sell us the extra_insurance as otherwise we would have to pay € 0000 excess ( this amount was reserved on my credit_card anyway and paying € 00 per day extra wouldn_'_t have changed this ).
neutral	this was boring and time wasting but i had expected it and managed to resist this rip - off .
neutral	we were given a free upgrade to bigger car , thank_you , and told to go over to collect the car that had no scratches or damage at all , but if we saw anything we should bring it to the attention of the man there .
neutral	having been ripped_off previously ( by europecar ) i knew better_than to accept their word but i was surprised to find that the car was covered with scratches , some damaged paintwork , a damaged mirror and 0 damaged hubcaps .
neutral	maybe they just save_money by having us punters do the work for them or maybe they would just have charged me for the damage if i hadn_'_t spent 00_mins documenting it , either way that could have been better service if they had made an accurate record of the damage instead of telling_me there was none .
neutral	car was ok , hadn_'_t been washed , windscreen_washer didn_'_t work but nothing serious .
neutral	on returning car the man barely checked it ( apart_from the fuel gage ) ( but did check the car before me quite thoroughly and found some damage that may or may not have been there before according to the user ) and sent me off with the paperwork to the office .
neutral	unfortunately there was a queue of people waiting to go through the insurance sales routine in front of me and each one took 00_minutes so with just one person on the desk , it was an_hour before i could drop_off the papers .
neutral	fortunately we had allowed 0 hours before the flight so we just managed to get the shuttle_bus , go through check - in , grab a sandwich to eat through security , and then board with no time to spare .
neutral	could have done without the stress .
neutral	suggested_improvements :
neutral	offer insurance with a reasonable excess to start with .
neutral	make_sure the damage inventory is complete and accurate .
neutral	wash cars
neutral	fix minor_issues ( windscreen_washer )
neutral	have separate pick - up / drop_off people on the desk .
neutral	thank_you for :
neutral	free upgrade
neutral	allowing us to return with full_tank ( instead of saying it had to be returned empty and charging a flat_rate €_000 to re - fill as happened to my sister with a different company at pisa )
neutral	polite and friendly staff .
neutral	they often have very useful products which mostly " do what they say on the tin " but don_'_t be_fooled with all the " free offers "!
neutral	they overload your mailbox with way too much spam !
neutral	to cut a long_story_short , i have the 00mbit fibre package but most times don_'_t get it , even using an ethernet connection .
neutral	i don_'_t do file sharing so it can '_t be due to the traffic management policy for 00m customers .
neutral	but , fortunately , i still get most of what i need done in good enough time so i won_'_t dwell too much on this .
neutral	the biggest beef i '_ve had with them though is with their billing .
neutral	i received a call from a vm rep one time offering me free phone and tv on top of my 00m package .
neutral	i made sure i asked_him multiple_times what '_s the catch and whether i will be paying more money per_month than i was at the time ; he answered an emphatic " no !"
neutral	a week before the installation for the upgrade , i even called vm and asked another rep to confirm i wasn_'_t going to pay more than what i was paying at the time .
neutral	he kinda sounded a bit surprised the rep was able to offer me the package he did but after " checking with his_supervisor " confirmed , " no , you '_ll be paying the same money you ' re paying now !"
neutral	well , it was installed and i got a new contract in the mail which showed my monthly_fee to be £_00 or so more .
neutral	i called cancellations before the 0 day period and was assured i '_m not being charged for the tv and phone and that he would do whatever in the system to ensure i '_m not charged more than i '_m currently paying .
neutral	you ' d have thought they ' d get it right by now , woudln '_t you ?
neutral	well , it took about 0 or 0 months for me to get it sorted and for me to get in touch with a nice lady in disconnections who understood my frustration and who not only fixed my bill but also ensured i '_m receiving a £ 0 loyalty_discount for the next 00 months .
neutral	i never use the landline phone and don_'_t really watch the tv because that basic package is essentially freeview .
neutral	plus , i have sky , which has better channels for the money .
neutral	however , i won_'_t even think about calling virgin_media and asking anyone to mess with my package .
neutral	what i have will have to stay until either the contract_ends or another fibre provider is offering services in my area , where i can switch if vm doesn_'_t get it right again !
neutral	it '_s a mixed_bag with vodafone in my experience .
neutral	as for phone service , i '_ve never had any_problems_whatsoever .
neutral	the service is pretty good .
neutral	data , while not bad is not great ... it gets even worse when it comes to mobile_broadband .
neutral	customer service is hit or miss .
neutral	i '_ve had mobile_broadband with vodafone for just over a year and have to say i '_m mighty glad the contract is coming to an end !
neutral	i can only think of a couple times in which i wanted to use it that it actually ran_smoothly without multiple drop - outs or failed utterly by just showing me the vodafone landing page .
neutral	it could be the locations i '_m in at the time but as it '_s always a different location each time , i '_ve just come to the conclusion that their real world 0g broadband coverage needs some serious work .
neutral	sometimes i just either ended_up using my phone ( dunno if it uses a different access point to the mobile_broadband service ) or just driving along and waiting until i reached home or the office where there '_s wi_-_fi .
neutral	while , thankfully , the data issues don_'_t affect me too often , since i '_m usually at a location where i can get excellent wi_-_fi , what has affected me and left me irate is their customer service .
neutral	sometimes you '_ll call 000 and get someone_who seems to know what they ' re doing and leave you with a pleasant_experience while 00_% of the time , you might come_across someone that doesn_'_t appear to know either what '_s going on .
neutral	worst , they ' re times one rep will tell you one thing while 0 other reps tell you 0 totally different things , leaving you not knowing which is correct .
neutral	i recently tried to cancel 0 business lines .
neutral	i called 000 and was told , " oh , that '_s easy : you need to give us 00 days written notice so all you need to do is go to our website , click this link and then that link and state that you ' d like to cancel the lines .
neutral	you should get a confirmation_email back ; if you don_'_t , you '_ll know it ( the email ) hasn_'_t gone_through properly !"
neutral	easy enough ...
neutral	i did exactly as he explained and received the confirmation_email .
neutral	then , after receiving two emails from two different customer service persons at vodafone asking me to verify my details , i replied with the information they requested .
neutral	over the next two_weeks , however , i received around 0 other emails from other reps providing me with conflicting_information and telling_me the lines will be cancelled at the end of their contract period , instead of the requested 00 day period even_though i agreed to pay the early_termination fees .
neutral	it took me to call vodafone again , explain the situation to someone in the small business team who actually did have sense and who made a note in the system explaining what i needed done .
neutral	the same day , a different person from the customer_services team called me and did not seem to " get it " either until i explained myself again to her .
neutral	finally , she seemed to get it and i '_m keeping my fingers_crossed and waiting_patiently until next month to be sure they finally did get it right .
neutral	vodafone , if you ' re listening , you need to go back to the drawing_board and work on your customer service !
neutral	people need to be re - trained and need to demonstrate they understand what '_s going on before they deal with customers , else you will lose more customers .
neutral	i was prepared to cancel all my services with vodafone if i had to explain myself to another rep ... of course , that would probably have been another hypertensive exercise !
neutral	paypal is a very convenient method of payment .
neutral	it '_s also convenient and free to send personal funds to persons in the same country .
neutral	however , paypal can be a bit expensive for sellers , especially sellers who ' re already paying through the nose in ebay fees for expensive goods like smartphones and computers .
neutral	after paying ebay £_00 for items £_000 or more , there '_s then the paypal_fees to contend with , even_though paypal is an ebay company .
neutral	there should be a reduced fee for sellers who sell through ebay , especially for more_expensive goods .
neutral	for buyers , the paypal experience is generally smooth , unless a buyer has to open a case against a seller who didn_'_t provide a good in the allotted_time and who is refusing to communicate or respond to the paypal claims team .
neutral	in this case , buyers have to wait 00 working_days if the seller refuses to communicate before they can get their money back ; this is in addition to the 0 days the buyer probably waited already before filing the claim .
neutral	also , i '_ve also thought that a buyer could defraud a seller by claiming they returned an item when , in fact , they just returned some garbage so they can provide paypal with a tracking_number .
neutral	likewise , a seller could potentially defraud a buyer with the same " proof ".
neutral	thankfully , i haven_'_t had any situations like that , either as a buyer or a seller , so i '_m not sure how paypal would deal with a situation like that .
neutral	for me to give paypal 0 or more stars , i think they should shorten the time they give non - supplying sellers to respond to 0 calendar days or 0 working_days at the most .
neutral	also , they should look at a solution that allows ebay_sellers who aren_'_t business sellers with special rates to receive a slightly_lower fee so sellers don_'_t just opt for free sites like gumtree ( which , incidentally , is another ebay company last time i checked ).
neutral	had paid an extra £ 0 for next working day delivery and ended picking it up from the post_office myself a week_later .
neutral	order seemed to be accepted fine we had arranged to pick this up from our local warehouse as we needed the wood quickly .
neutral	we did not hear_anything re times for collecting it so i phoned up and the gentleman said he would contact the warehouse to see when this could be done and phone me back , he did not phone back but sent an email which was fine , when my husband went to collect the item they had no record of it and after many phone_calls from the warehouse it was discovered that it had been requested from a warehouse in another county and being delivered , it was sorted_out in the end but without the help of the warehouse i dont_know what would have happened .
neutral	web_site confusing about delivery didn_'_t give options .
neutral	placed order on saturday_morning 00th of may but could not get anyone on the phone until tuesday 00th i don_'_t know why as it wasn_'_t a bank_holiday or anything ... oh well :-/
neutral	poor communication between different staff and customer .
neutral	otherwise reasonably fair sevice .
neutral	shame that one person spoiled it .
neutral	bathing aids : cast & dressing protectors : cast and bandage protector - adult - long leg ... not suitable to use with compression bandaging .
neutral	believe this should be stated in description .
neutral	great service in terms of speedy delivery , but damaged box when it arrived
neutral	ordered the otho pen and arrived as usual in quick time but the refill jammed and wouldn_'_t retract .
neutral	returned it and got refund .
neutral	first time ever i got a dud but ill stick to my usual caran d ' ache brand in future for quality that works
neutral	well as per_title .. its good but for the extra money i don_'_t see the difference really .
neutral	rather save_money for the same product .
neutral	happy with the service on the day of order .
neutral	delay in delivery , failure to inform_me .
neutral	overall happy with goods but will be using them first in august .
neutral	the product selection is pretty good and the web shop is clear and easily_navigable .
neutral	i found the prices fair and the options for bulk buy are useful .
neutral	i '_ve only used the service twice and found the turn a round time to get the order processed longer_than_expected .
neutral	to be fair both orders were placed close to bank_holidays , but this should '_ve been calculated into the estimated delivery time .
neutral	tracking facilities are standard and good .
neutral	delivery excellent .
neutral	mats not a good fit for 00 plate auris , edges scuffy and eyelets had to be modified to fit front driver side hooks .
neutral	back seat mats seem too large .
neutral	price well below toyota official product so you get what you pay for ..
neutral	good service prompt and efficient , was disappointed that my phone was found to be " not working " owing to wear and tear on the menu button ( iphone ).
neutral	i have been using the phone for 00 months so of course wear and tear will happen .
neutral	but , my argument remains that the button worked .
neutral	this is a grey_area that requires greater clarity in your t &_cs / faqs as i '_m_sure i '_m not the first to feel hard done by .
neutral	lovely_flowers but left_outside house without ringing bell when occupants were in
neutral	i '_ve only just purchased this policy and it hasn_'_t even come into force yet .
neutral	so_far the process has_been fine with quick online responses and a quick e_- mail with my policy_documents .
neutral	however , the real_test will come if i ever have to claim and then we '_ll see how good they are .
neutral	never having used made before i thought they were ok except for the way they packaged the framed limited_edition photo that i bought .
neutral	the corners were not protected so it arrived slightly_damaged .
neutral	i deliberated for ages about whether to send it back but in the end decided that it wasn_'_t worth the hassle because i wanted to put it up quickly before my house warming party .
neutral	unfortunately upon_arrival at the airport it was almost 0 hours before our shared shuttle took off .
neutral	this resulted_in a significant delay over the quoted arrival time and the villa owners we were meeting had to wait_until the middle of the night to meet us with the keys .
neutral	further stress was seen when we found we couldn_'_t be dropped_off anywhere close to the place we booked the travel to ( i had to get a taxi at additional_cost ), there was plenty time for resorthoppa to get in touch with us on this .
neutral	finally finding out our pickup time proved almost_impossible as it never got put up on the website and after me finally phoning them ( at significant cost to me ) i got it sorted_out with them , however the representative was rather snippy .
neutral	next time i would be booking a private shuttle , however i would still use resorthoppa .
neutral	the items i ordered arrived in a very short time , iwas very satisfied with what i had ordered .
neutral	the only_downside was that at the top of the advert it stated that all deliveries were free , but i then found that my items attracted a delivery charge that was nearly as much as the items themselves . buyer be aware of this
neutral	you matched a rival comp on price , you also said you would throw in some firelighters free but did not arrive .
neutral	had a really good time searching through the website and i found the ordering_process one of the best i '_ve ever_seen , however upon delivery of my magnets i spotted bubbling on the finished surface of the magnets .
neutral	some areas of the surface was even flaking off .
neutral	so to some it all up i ' d say that the website is great yet the product needs refining .
neutral	as above as above
neutral	the quality of the work which was carried_out was great , but it took along time to deliver , after having to chase the order a couple of times ... would i use them again ?
neutral	probaby , but would be on their case a bit more .
neutral	the service from nationwide was very good and they made sure that everything was perfect for a smooth_transition to leasing .
neutral	although delivery was 000_miles_away so this put 000_miles onto the car that i did not do .
neutral	then the driver asked to be dropped_off to the train_station which would have been a 00 mile_round_trip .
neutral	this is what let a superb service down to just average .
neutral	the vibrater and double ender are brilliant but the two so called real_life dildos might as well go in the bin to small look nothing like the picture you display sorry phil
neutral	ordered online as sale prices were very good .
neutral	still_waiting on the items 00 days after ordering , after being charged £ 0 for delivery .
neutral	customer service a little frustrating , as advised that one of the in - stock items is in fact out of stock .
neutral	after suggesting the same item in another colour it was added .
neutral	after being advised the second choice item is out of stock , i choose a third item .
neutral	i cannot understand how items that ' have been added to my order ' can then be out of stock - assuming their stock system would only allow in - stock items to be selected .
neutral	by comparison i have previously ordered from another site and have the received the items very quickly with no delivery charge .
neutral	in summary - good deals but not so good service .
neutral	i paid for a parcel to be delivered and as far as i know , you did !
neutral	the frame didn_'_t fit together that well and it required some brute_force to assemble it !
neutral	i was disappointed that it didn_'_t come with the file box sections and the price of buying these through you was insult to injury !
neutral	i just wish there wouldnt be 0 hours
neutral	in between sails due to roadworks
neutral	i was 0 minutes late
neutral	i asked the lady to redirect me over dunkirk
neutral	but she said there was no ferry too
neutral	so i had to wait 0 hours
neutral	this was a sail forseen at 00 : 00
neutral	on friday oct 0th
neutral	im sailing every week from wednesday outbound to friday inbound
neutral	kr dr reygaerts
neutral	not quite the eleventh_hour ...... but near enough fer me ;-) ordered !
neutral	paid for !
neutral	and nearly delivered on time ............. all hell broke loose when even the carrier was confident the delivery did not make the van in time to be shipped ..... oooooohhhh no i will have to take tomorrow off !
neutral	it arrived the same day as promised .
neutral	yeyyyyy very late but yey anyway .
neutral	the batteries in the camera packed up the same day as opened ( christmas day ) the team said no liability on batteries .
neutral	the other thing is that the camera nikon_coolpix l000 does not employ a driver for the software that comes with the kit .
neutral	ie you can not upload straight to your comp via the camera and usb supplied .
neutral	top tip ditch the usb and supply better batteries !
neutral	good as listed in magazine
neutral	superb product poor logistics
neutral	thought they would be bigger , seemed a lot of green in the bouquet so bit overpriced for what was there .
neutral	we were attending a family wedding and meeting family who had flown in on other flights before picking_up the rental car .
neutral	unfortunately the rental pick_up isn_'_t land - side at malaga and to get back thru to air - side is very difficult .
neutral	dual desks on either side would be sensible .
neutral	that said the car was superb , very clean and comfortable and perfectly served our requirements .
neutral	great idea and easy to use .
neutral	payout speed varies considerably from one merchant to another .
neutral	website very easy to use .
neutral	still_waiting for £_00 . 00 from may
neutral	it took too long for the drivers to arrive at the terminal after notification .
neutral	i ahd to wait in the rain to indicate to your driver where we were parked .
neutral	also on return , it would be better to call prior to collecting bags to minimise waiting time for cars return
neutral	took longer_than said to finalise deal due to the fact i hadn_'_t deactivated the icloud which i didn_'_t realise had to be done wasn_'_t till i contacted them that i was informed about this issue once i ' d deactivated the deal went straight though but if id been contacted immediately that this needed doing it would of been more beneficial to both party '_s .. other than this small but time_consuming issue everything else was acted on professionally ..
neutral	flowers were as shown although some roses looked several days old and were already_wilting .
neutral	well what can i say ??
neutral	i rang twice prior to putting the album pages together in photoshop , to find out what the useable area of the page was .
neutral	got 0 different_sizes given to me by the ' help ' staff .
neutral	not a good start !!
neutral	album arrived damaged on one corner .
neutral	the packing seems very flimsy .
neutral	( speak to amazon about packing , their '_s is brilliant ).
neutral	spoke to laura on the help_desk and she was extremely knowledgeable and helpful and resolved my issues very effectively .
neutral	thanks laura .
neutral	just awaiting the replacement album and fingers_crossed .
neutral	software needs to be a little_bit more finite / accurate for the pros that use this service .
neutral	helps when loading pages buuuuuut the paper quality and printing was brilliant .
neutral	many_thanks for your help laura .
neutral	unable to purchase due to bank security check each time i try to make a purchase from gamesbite resulting in purchase being turned down untill check complete .
neutral	which means i am unable to re - order for 00_hrs due to failed order while completing security check .
neutral	which means i have to source points else where so i don_'_t miss the offer i was hoping to purchase .
neutral	meaning not sure if after 00_hrs i would still be able to purchase .
neutral	maybe you should add paypal to your payment options or once a successful purchase has_been made log the details so that there is no need for security check everytime .
neutral	bought an_epiphone ej000e acoustic from them recently , which was poorly set_up out the factory - no fault of reidys here .
neutral	this resulted_in issues with intonation and was always out of tune when fretted .
neutral	i called them and they were very happy to give advice and just asked me to change the strings and give them a call back .
neutral	i tried to give them a call back to speak to the same person and on 0 occasions they said he was busy and he ' d give me a call back .
neutral	it never happened and i '_m still_waiting .
neutral	disappointed , i also emailed them and asked for a return under dsr - which they ignored .
neutral	very poor from a customer service perspective .
neutral	pleasant staff over the phone , but disorganised and uninterested in after sales support .
neutral	i gave up in the end and sought to sanding down the bridge_saddle and adjusting the nut and truss_rod myself and now it '_s far far better .
neutral	i just don_'_t feel like i had a very good experience as a customer so i thought i ' d mention it .
neutral	delivery however was quick and spot on though , no_problems there .
neutral	i use it all the time to ship things i buy and sell .
neutral	i strongly_recommend it to others . it is however , far from perfect .
neutral	one thing that is crap is that i cant save the " ship to " addresses in the address book .
neutral	the booking_procedure does ask me if i want to save the delivery info but it does not work which in my opinion is inexcusable .
neutral	great site but flawed through arrogance and intransigence of the operators .
neutral	ordered underwear for my girlfiend 0 days ago and it was delivered today , inside the packaging i found 0 of her cami '_s thrown in a mess not even in wrapping like the other was , thats not on in itself . also im returning 0 items which are real poor quality for the money i paid , again not on !
neutral	pretty_much like i shopped in a pound store except i paid more than a pound . not happy with their service at all over the past year ive spend well over £_000 on very few items with them and the way i recieved my goods today will be the last i shop there . regards
neutral	car was delivered to and collected from our villa at the times requested .
neutral	would have preferred the car came with a full_tank of fuel with the option of either returning it full or being charged for fuel used .
neutral	being delivered with only a 0 / 0 of a tank meant our first priority was finding a filling_station rather_than going for a drive to see the island .
neutral	our car was ok but the bodywork was scratched in many places .
neutral	we had a problem with the brakes the first time we drove the car which was very quickly rectified by returning the car to the office and another was supplied .
neutral	the chap_who delivered the car must have been aware of the problem as it turned_out a brake lining was missing from the brake_pad - sounds dangerous but i have mechanical experience and was able to get the car back to the office without problems .
neutral	i would use this company again but i would test_drive the car with a member of staff before accepting it .
neutral	there was no ability to " be creative " - it was unclear how much variety of presentations there were .
neutral	when delivery date was asked , the next_day , mother '_s day , took me to another page and it was unclear whether or not my original order had to be re - inputted or was no_longer valid .
neutral	i had to do this 0 - 0 times before i understand to ignore the leap to a new page .
neutral	buying was simple enough and we '_ll see whether or not the flowers arrive .
neutral	good luckk
neutral	i ordered the product on the 00th_may , it finally arrived on the 00th_june - not particularly acceptable .
neutral	used dpd and they were particularly poor .
neutral	product looks good and is well_packaged but haven_'_t used yet
neutral	the price was pretty reasonable , about 00 quid but when i saw the flowers they weren_'_t great and very small .
neutral	....
neutral	i suppose it '_s what you have to accept with choosing something online and not seeing it in person , so maybe i '_m being a little_harsh ...
neutral	the woman i sent it to was happy about them and i got my leg over so i shouldn_'_t complain i suppose .
neutral	only problem was with delivery date .
neutral	took day of work .
neutral	stayed in all day and waited .
neutral	no show .
neutral	neighbour had to sign for delivery as i
neutral	had to work .
neutral	the hot_water_pump i wanted was cheapest with hie ( the plumbing shop ).
neutral	i ordered it on the 0 to 0 days delivery .
neutral	after 0 days i phoned to see where it was : " it will be going out today ".
neutral	the next_day , nothing so i phoned again and was told it would be delivered the next_day which it was .
neutral	so it was 0 days in total , rather_than the maximum of 0 stated on the website .
neutral	as we had no hot_water without the pump we weren_'_t impressed with the delay or the fact i had to chase twice .
neutral	it turned_out that the firm was selling to me from the channel_islands ( presumably to save vat ), and the goods were mailed from a small town in switzerland .
neutral	all to save a couple of quid .
neutral	silly .
neutral	waited for three_weeks for order to arrive , when i checked my order it said it had still not been despatched .
neutral	when i emailed them to ask why it had still not been sent i received no reply but my delivery did arrive the following_day .
neutral	plumbing place seemed efficient with emails etc .
neutral	but the shipping company driver was an unhelpful person .
neutral	would have given them 0 or 0_stars but for that .
neutral	on the desk they tried to sell several services and upgrades .
neutral	i said , ii orderd that car and nothing else .
neutral	my son would have driven two_days with the car and they asked 00dollar for each day we hired the car .
neutral	our son left us after those two_days so he could not have driven more .
neutral	asking 000dollars for that was wrong and made me angry .
neutral	it took one our before everything was all right and we could drive , thats not good .
neutral	i like the company and the product .
neutral	but the use of the distributor is causing inconvenience .
neutral	the stuff is good and quite well priced .
neutral	they sell like they were still in the 00s though .
neutral	into the office .... hard_sell on wax protection and insurance etc .
neutral	the worst part is they suggest ( up to ) 00 days delivery and try to sell you an earlier delivery at cost .
neutral	they need to catch up with the customer service improvements of modern companies .
neutral	i refused the extra_cost , complained about the wait for the furniture and asked if they could do anything for free .
neutral	they refused , and i considered cancelling my order .
neutral	amusingly they confirmed early delivery ( 0days_later ) by text ... 0 minutes after i left the shop .
neutral	previous service was outstanding , unfortunately this time the rose ordered was lifeless and died within 00_hours of receiving it , even_though in a vase of water which was part of the order .
neutral	arrgh well can '_t win them all .
neutral	was okay , car was still there when we got there which was a good start !
neutral	shuttle_bus was regular .
neutral	just not very well sign posted and we ended_up spending about 00_minutes driving round in circles trying to find it !
neutral	over all was okay .
neutral	overall good but had a few issues with out of stock items and wrong information via_email etc .
neutral	also some orders a few_months back were slow to dispatch with no mention of reason until i prompted - this has_improved for me at_least more recently .
neutral	one thing they must change - given that the privacy is rather important subject these days i hate the fact that every item you click on has the name of the item in the url too - hardly private browsing .
neutral	change that please .
neutral	car parking good and accessible
neutral	generally a good experience , the items all arrived and i paid much less_than if i had bought things at a supermarket .
neutral	the delivery wasn_'_t up to scratch however : i ordered on a thursday_evening and expected everything to arrive on the monday as next_day delivery is advertised , however when i called on monday it turned_out that it hadn_'_t been sent , i got an_apology but no explanation .
neutral	i got the order on tuesday but had to wait in all day for it , another company i order from uses_dpd and is able to give me a one hour delivery slot , dpd offers this service to their customers for free so it would make_sense for sushisushi to make use of it and keep their customers happier .
neutral	i was also given no tracking_number with my delivery confirmation_email , simple things can mean the difference_between repeat_custom and looking for better service elsewhere .
neutral	a simple item such as a clip i would expect to be available .
neutral	while the order process and order status feedback was great unfortunately the automated_responses were not quite fitting for a funeral .
neutral	always used vodafone on my mobiles throughout the years , they are pretty reliable , never had a problem with them , the signal is sloppy in certain_areas but i imagine thats the case with most of the network_providers .
neutral	i needed to change my booking - that was done pretty quickly and efficiently and did not cost too much extra so that was good .
neutral	the hassle was at the airport ( manchester t0 multi - story ).
neutral	they are meant to detect your booking via your license_plate - that didn_'_t work ( and i suspect that was a problem for others trying to enter at same time ).
neutral	i didn_'_t have the qr_code ( or confirmation_email ) to hand and had a queue_behind me , so pressed the green button .
neutral	once parked i then located my email , and realised that it was probably safer to leave as once you have pressed the green button your booking is not recognised .
neutral	so i left ( getting charged £ 0 . 00 ) and tried again .
neutral	still didn_'_t recognise license_plate and didn_'_t recognise qr_code , but could speak to someone via intercom and give booking number .
neutral	still don_'_t know if i have done the correct thing - therefore i think it is quite complicated ( and i am £ 0 . 00 out of pocket )
neutral	booking was easy - site was easy to navigate and understand .
neutral	but - don_'_t add the booking_fee art the end - be honest and either include it in your prices ( it '_s not as if it '_s an optiona ; extra ) or show it up front .
neutral	iwm
neutral	good price - matched applicances online with whom we '_ve had excellent experience in past , it '_s just that they ' d not got the model in stock when we wanted it .
neutral	communications we ' re ok , but nowhere_near as detailed and informative as aforementioned company .
neutral	had an e_- mail / automated phone_call on the day prior to delivery stating the time , but there was no way of confirming the date / time online , prior to this .
neutral	the allotted_time - slot came and went and had to contact hughes_direct to find out what was going on twice .
neutral	was told it would be delivered in the next two hours .
neutral	two hours came and went and was then told we should contact the delivery company direct ourselves .
neutral	my wife replied that hughes should contact them and let us know the answer , as the couriers were the company employed by them !
neutral	hughes_direct did eventually contact the couriers and call back with the reply that ' i really don_'_t know what to say .
neutral	.
neutral	. it will be delivered sometime today '
neutral	the couriers eventually delivered the fridge later that evening around 0 . 00pm - the scheduled delivery was between 00am - 0 . 00pm !
neutral	if my wife hadn_'_t happened to have the day off work it might have caused a lot of hassle .
neutral	other wise very good
neutral	medals are lovely but the engraving doesn_'_t stand out at all
neutral	lenses are good and match those supplied by high - street store but lower - priced frames leave a lot to be desired .
neutral	the cabinet i ordered was to store a large_quantity of music c . ds .
neutral	the cabinet arrived in good time and in good condition .
neutral	my only_criticism was that the on - line information lead me to believe that each of the drawers would be provided with separation inserts for storage of my cds in three rows .
neutral	after receiving my cabinet without such dividers i re - read the on - line information which only stated that cds could be stored in three rows .
neutral	my original interpretation could be said to have been wrong , but it would have been good , at the price paid , if ( for storage purposes ) inserts had been provided to maintain necessary separation between each row .
neutral	as it is i have had to resort to another separation solution which looks much less neat and less professional .
neutral	looking neat and professional was the idea behind making the acquisition in the first place .
neutral	the process was straightforward and went well .
neutral	however the price for oil disposal was not shown upfront , but came up when i clicked on making a purchase .
neutral	this should have been included in the initial price .
neutral	another disadvantage was that i could not choose the type of oil .
neutral	ideally i wanted a semisynthetic for a lower price , but it was not possible to choose .
neutral	i will have to see how the oil_change goes ...
neutral	booked 0 trips through viator but had contrasting experiences . canyon trip : late being picked_up from hotel , not very informative during flight and bus trip , requested gluten_free lunch for wife and son , these were not supplied . almost directed onto wrong bus for journey back to hotel .
neutral	asked driver twice which bus we needed and told wrong one both_times . luckily other persons on bus gestured to us to get on correct bus .
neutral	atv tour : very good trip , very informative guides , small group ( 0 ) made it more personal and son got gluten_free lunch .
neutral	good price but bed_frame arrived damaged .
neutral	telephoned mattress shed on thursday and sent email with photos but am still_waiting for a response ( tuesday 00th_march ).
neutral	great service but expected a better price for my phone
neutral	just use royal_mail ...
neutral	they drop_off automatically with neighbours or leave a card for a local_depot
neutral	i ordered the 00 red_roses for my wife as a gift for our first wedding_anniversary .
neutral	i unfortunately couldn_'_t get them delivered on sunday but to no_avail .
neutral	most florists deliver flower bouquets in water to keep them fresh but these weren_'_t in water either so had dried out a bit by the time i gave them to my wife .
neutral	not the best present but there you go .
neutral	love the product , sounds great !
neutral	delivery very quick , staff friendly .
neutral	however , disappointed with the ' deal '.
neutral	on paper / website it all seemed like a good deal until it arrived and i saw the quality of the connectors .
neutral	no way those cables and connectors were worth £_00 .
neutral	i put my trust in the website marketing claims but it seems i should have shopped_around more .
neutral	in my opinion , i could have just bought all the items seperately and it would have cost the same .
neutral	in fact , with more extensive ' googling ' i later found a similar but better deal ( 0m of same cables instead of 0m ) £_00 cheaper .
neutral	disappointing , but granted , my own fault .
neutral	would have sent it all back but i didn_'_t open all the bags etc very carefully and as the returns_policy seemed strict on this i didn_'_t think it would be an easy process .
neutral	i clicked the radio button to not have travel_insurance but the price still included it .
neutral	this was rectified when i refreshed my browser , but not before i had experienced some concern .
neutral	great prescription prada_sunglasses .
neutral	i can '_t fault the communication from fashion_eyewear , but the first time they told me they had despatched my glasses , there was no such tracking_number with royal_mail and they had vanished into thin_air .
neutral	this meant a lengthy delay whilst another frame was ordered from italy .
neutral	now they are with me i like them very much .
neutral	the chocolate_trading company has an easy to use website , with a very wide_choice of chocolate .
neutral	my order was acknowledged and dispatched on the day that i placed the order , monday .
neutral	it was sent royal_mail tracked and arrived , well - packed , on thursday .
neutral	this really isn_'_t good enough .
neutral	i am a frequent internet shopper and the best traders that i buy from , ensure that their goods arrive within 00 - 00_hours , which meant wednesday at the latest .
neutral	this is not cheap chocolate and with p_&_p at £ 0 . 00 and stated delivery of 0 - 0 days , this company isn_'_t performing as well as it could to keep customers , at_least this one , happy .
neutral	recent increases in parking charges are spoiling the airport .
neutral	ordered sky phone with fiber internet they arrived to install my internet only to find out my phone did not work one week latta i asked why has my phone still not been fixed was told fault at exchange , then was told o we might cut you off if we like as we have noticed you have a old dept with us witch i don_'_t have , so only after 0_weeks with them they did agree to cancel my contract free of charge due to the phone not being repaired witch was nice of them , so not all bad some times can be nice people but this time my time was wasted
neutral	received faulty goods so had to return .
neutral	customer service was good and efficient , postage was refunded , my only additional comment would be an email to say the item had been received by yourselves as the replacement item was sent out as i was concerned you hadn_'_t received the item as it took about a week to get the new item .
neutral	i did get proof of postage
neutral	the site is great and really good at getting the products out it time , but the hellboy costume was really poor quality the mask ripped straight up the back and was really thin .
neutral	for the money that was paid i think it was very poor .
neutral	very happy with the service provided , but a little disappointed with the actual flowers .
neutral	good service and platform .
neutral	easy to use and would use again .
neutral	very poor response to advert i placed from the platform , however i think has to do with the market for renting in my area rather_than rentify .
neutral	when you return the proper length of led_lighting , ie .
neutral	000cm
neutral	i give you a full rating .
neutral	disappointed with the packaging which was torn , split and crumpled .
neutral	the fare type should be clearly_displayed as well as changes and cancellation_fees of the ticket .
neutral	i placed an order with golfbase in excess of £_000 , i was then contacted by them to say one of the items was not in stock and would be given a refund for that item , i conducted a web search for the item and found it still available in their ebay site .
neutral	i rang them and they apologised and said they would take it off their site .
neutral	the refund was prompt and also refunded the £ 0 . 00 delivery charge as well , good communication with golbase
neutral	i use dfds newhaven dieppe because it '_s a good route for my destination in brittany , but there are times it is so expensive that i make alternative travel_plans . the worst thing is that i have friends who work on the ships and say they have the spare capacity . so by being too pricy i know they loose clients . wish they would have a clearer frequent_traveller set_up . at present if you join the frequent_traveller scheme it '_s a lotttery as to if you can get on . it '_s getting to the stage where with friends we are thinking of keeping a spare / or hire car in dieppe and just go over as foot passengers .
neutral	im happy with items i ordered . i was promised a free_gift with my first order . i entered the code at check out as requested . the order arrived without the free_gift . i contacted frost . they didn_'_t bother to reply . i will think_twice before i will have any future dealings with them .
neutral	i remember the first time i logged in to facebook , amazingly just 0 - 0 years_ago or so and was intrigued by the concept , it was all so new but was also still in it '_s infancy so i soon lost interest and didn_'_t visit it again for over a year !
neutral	when i did log back on i saw that the site had evolved massively and was much more than just an half - hour interest visit to check on zombie or vampire challenges or some such gubbins .
neutral	it had become a genuine ' social_network '.
neutral	clearly , fast evolution is required in any early e_- project if it '_s to grow and survive in such a competitive world but after a while you simply have to stop twatting about with it !
neutral	you listening zuckerberg ?
neutral	i am utterly threaders with having to relearn where everything is every few_months , and as for you deciding what you think i might find important , well ... you ain '_t god dude .
neutral	let your baby go man , improve by all means in the back - end but leave the front bits alone .
neutral	if you don_'_t , as soon as a viable_alternative comes along , everyone will jump ship .
neutral	i '_ve been looking at twitter but it '_s sh ! t .
neutral	maybe i should come up with my own ... craniumkindle maybe !!
neutral	;-)
neutral	seriously though ... leave it alone now !
neutral	!
neutral	this is a comprehensive site standing for the internet movie database and has_become very popular amongst the proletariat as well as the executive in recent years .
neutral	but , as massively successful sites are wont to do ( facebook !
neutral	), they become a victim of their own success and have been criticised in a number of areas in the past , most recently for publishing ages of actors without their consent .
neutral	you might say wgaf but actually , it '_s an important_factor when casting agents , well , cast so it becomes an accepted grey_area and actors may find it useful to misrepresent themselves occassionally .
neutral	there has also been allegations of the site refusing to ' display ' and therefore advertise certain films .
neutral	still , if ever you recognise an actor but can '_t get his_name off the tip off yer tongue then imdb ( or wiki ) will be there for you to put yer out of yer misery .
neutral	although the packaging was not damaged the surface of the corotile was damaged on the top sheet and the odd edge on the remainder .
neutral	i think the surface is easily damaged .
neutral	i have touched up with a anti - rust paint .
neutral	the screws were not always long enough for fixing through overlaps and i would of preferred a self_tapping screw to ensure a tight fit .
neutral	i replaced some of the supplied screws with self tappers swapping the rubber washes and again painted them grey .
neutral	otherwise it did the job .
neutral	the part that i ordered through partmaster was as_described and cost £ 0 . 00 with an additional £ 0 . 00 postage a total of £_00 . 00 .
neutral	i subsequently ordered and received the same part from a competitor for £ 0 . 00 delivered .
neutral	maybe partmaster should look at their delivery costs as it seems to be standard across their business and rather high .
neutral	service was good .
neutral	flowers delivered before 00am ( as paid for ).
neutral	can track delivery online too which is a nice feature .
neutral	email enquiry responded to in good time .
neutral	however , the actual product was not up to scratch .
neutral	paid for a large and extra large bouquet .
neutral	the roses_died within 0 days .
neutral	not what i was expecting considering how much i paid for them .
neutral	dont quite fit car
neutral	the website is very inviting and professional .
neutral	ordered the flowers just fine but that '_s when it all went wrong .
neutral	trying to get contact with the company is almost_impossible , they don_'_t respond to emails there telephone_number doesn_'_t work and seems to be disconnected .
neutral	all together my experience was very stressful and i probably wouldn_'_t use them again .
neutral	needless to say the flowers were delivered within the time and they did look amazing .
neutral	but the customer service unfortunately is what i '_ll remember the most .
neutral	ok , they are usually the cheapest when you ' re after something , especially electronic products .
neutral	recently i '_ve been reading about their 0 hours staff and the terrible work schedules .
neutral	they are cheap but what what cost ?
neutral	product fine - could have just posted it through letter_box rather_than insist on specific slot .
neutral	handlebars incorrect , tyres incorrect , alternative rims / wheels supplied look terrible compared to the original dt swiss .
neutral	a few minor_issues i know but at £ 0 , 000 . 00 you would expect it to be spot on !
neutral	if it wasnt for the two week wait to recieve the bike i would have returned it for making right !
neutral	the service from the staff was great .
neutral	he was happy to help including letting_me know how far away i was travelling .
neutral	upon making the booking , i booked a volkswagen_golf ' or something similar '.
neutral	i do not believe a nissan_note has any similarities to a vw_golf .
neutral	it remindered me of the advert , sounds_like a golf .....
neutral	it wasnt .
neutral	booked a subcompact citroen ds0 through sicily_by car_rental to pick_up from bergamo airport .
neutral	booked online so that was all hassle_free .
neutral	got to airport to pick the car up and all the rental desks are together in the arrivals_hall .
neutral	should be easy to find the sicily_by car desk then ?
neutral	not so !
neutral	it is a shared desk with several other_companies like dollar and thrifty whose signs are far more prominent than sbyc .
neutral	the hertz_desk pointed_out the sbyc desk in a manner indicating that it was certainly not the first time a weary traveller had to ask the same question .
neutral	didn_'_t get the citroen ds0 car unfortunately , but i did get upgraded to the bigger brother ds0 model which did the trick .
neutral	straight on the shuttle_bus to the compound to pick the car up and off i drove after zero familiarisation from the sbyc employee .
neutral	good job i '_m experienced in renting_cars and driving in unfamiliar locations around europe .
neutral	there was a scuff to the drivers_side wing_mirror which wasn_'_t noted on hand over and the car was infested with ants - not nice !
neutral	generally the car could have been a lot cleaner .
neutral	handing the car back in took far too long as i waited_patiently ( 00_mins ) to hand the keys over and point out a few things to the agent ... ants for example !
neutral	he simply said i should have pushed in to the head of the small queue outside the tiny office .
neutral	found bravofly after_searching with kayak who directed me there .
neutral	i booked & paid .
neutral	i could not then find the booking on the airline website .
neutral	i then read some reviews of bravofly .
neutral	whilst i accept that people only post bad_experiences , they looked pretty scary .
neutral	then found my booking on the airline site .
neutral	all looks good , but we '_ll see what happens when i try to check in and go to the airport .
neutral	on the 0 of september_0000 i '_ve made my order for 0 products on this web_site .
neutral	the next_day i paid the amount of money !
neutral	the next week i received only 0 product ...
neutral	the rest of the products came on the 00 . 00 . 0000 .
neutral	during this time i had to make a lot of phone_calls to spain , i '_m from romania , in order to understand what was the status of my order , i would like to add that i was not informed about any_problems before i made the calls .
neutral	at first 0 pair of skies was out of stock , than the oder one was out of stock , after that the ones that i took as a replacement had problems .
neutral	it was very frustrating to keep on asking about the status of my order and nobody could tell what was the exact problem .
neutral	in the end it was all good because i received some better pairs of skiies at the same price .
neutral	the main_reason_why i '_m not so dissapointed is that we had no snow in romania during that time of the year :).
neutral	for me it was not the best online experience , but in the end i '_m very happy with the quality of the products that i received .
neutral	at this point i can '_t really say if i am going to buy anything from this website ...
neutral	when the product was bought there was no mention it was not in stock and we were promised delivery within ' i think ' 0 working_days .
neutral	the day before the last delivery date we were told it could take a further month to be delivered .
neutral	expected better quality packaging , most of the items were stuffed_into one box with the packaging ripped_open and badly taped_up .
neutral	would suggest that the weight of this package was way over the maximum safe working load .
neutral	my order was delayed twice .
neutral	no contact by them after 0nd delay .
neutral	when i eventually got hold of them having left messages .
neutral	delivery was near instant .
neutral	so bad communication , bad record keeping , bad order progressing .
neutral	good radiator , good price
neutral	initially i was sent the wrong product .
neutral	apparently this was the fault of the supplier rather_than buttercup farm , who dealt_with the problem reasonably swiftly and courteously by phone and email ( the whole_process took around 0_weeks from placing an order to finally receiving the correct product ).
neutral	however , communication was less good when it came to informing_me about collection of the incorrect product : a courier turned_up unannounced one evening , before i ' d been told about plans for a replacement ; despite_being told that someone would phone me to let_me know that a replacement was on its way , i received no such call and came home one evening to find the box propped up against the side of my house !
neutral	also , i ' d been led to believe by bf that i ' d be supplied with a complete replacement .
neutral	when i received a replacement , though , it was clear that i ' d simply received the original package with the incorrect parts taken out of the box and replaced with the new ones .
neutral	also , i have some mild concerns about the product supplied .
neutral	firstly the measurements weren_'_t quite right for the trellis component , which was 0mm or so too_narrow to fit the posts to either side .
neutral	secondly the instructions were confusing : the product included a main set of instructions , which don_'_t quite relate to the parts included in the box , since it shows the posts with a ' u '- shaped groove to attach them to the crossbeam rather_than an ' l '- shaped groove .
neutral	a second set of instructions is included with the screws , which shows the correct ' l '- shaped posts but shows the screws being placed differently from in the first set of instructions .
neutral	this is all most perplexing and i wouldn_'_t say this is the easiest product to assemble !
neutral	!
neutral	the furniture is top_notch .
neutral	but it took a bit long to come .
neutral	finding that my joyetech ego cc is leaking if i leave the battery turned on .
neutral	i sometimes end up with the liquid in my mouth , which is a bit_worrying seeing as the bottle of liquid says toxic on it .
neutral	the item i bought was as_described , the response to my offer was dealt_with quickly and communication was generally good .
neutral	however there was a major problem on delivery , the item i purchased was a 00 year_old gibson_guitar with its original case with a current value of approximately_£ 0000 .
neutral	the guitar arrived in its case with no protection / packaging whatsoever , it just had a cable tie around it , to stop the case from opening .
neutral	the gibson logo on the case had gone_missing thus de valuing the item significantly .
neutral	i did negotiate a small refund for the damage but to send a £ 0000 item through the post with no packaging shows a lack of care and professionalism
neutral	part ordered on backorder , apart_from that fine
neutral	our 00 year_old hotpoint_washing_machine ' died '.
neutral	options were to change the electronic controller (£_000 ) and or the motor (£_000 ).
neutral	all in all it had given good service and deserved retirement .
neutral	ao came up as the best supplier of a replacement that met our needs and it was delivered in a very timely_manner .
neutral	just as the delivery was due we got a call from ao to tell us that it was due any minute .
neutral	included in that call , amidst all the other stuff he chatted about , was some comment about appliance protection which was ' included ' at £ 0 . 00 a month and confirmation of the card number .
neutral	at the time it did not register that i had just bought protection until the policy arrived from domestic and general .
neutral	we did not want to be paying for support that the manufacturer was providing in the first year although we had thought about extended_warranty .
neutral	we immediately phoned dom & gen and cancelled .
neutral	going on line and checking out extended_warranty we found domestic and general offering manufacturers + 0 years extension at £ 0 . 00 a month giving a total of 0 years cover .
neutral	when we rang dom & gen they were not surprised we were cancelling the ao offering .
neutral	all in all ao were not professional in the way they offered / sold their appliance protection insurance at an inflated price .
neutral	the dom & gen offering at £ 0 . 00 pm gives exactly the same protection as that offered via ao .
neutral	to discuss an additional purchase on the phone , and imply its included , whilst a customer is distracted , looking out of the window , for the delivery truck and think about all the matters associated with the delivery is very unprofessional and verges on deceitful
neutral	i am seriously_considering referring this matter to the relevant trade body or trading_standards .
neutral	this appliance protection issue spoilt what was otherwise a 0_star experience with ao .
neutral	when enquiry was made as to delivery of item the response was rather off hand and not very helpful .
neutral	that fact that the christmas_rush was causing delays ought to have been mentioned on the website and although this was anticipated by me no explanation as to delivery time was made on the website prior to the order
neutral	was told a different a figure that i would be getting then told it would be less , not happy at all not really dealt_with professionally not offered any form of compensation just stated its a training issue not really good enough considering how much money they make as a company
neutral	+ ve : goods were cheap .
neutral	customer servive were helpful once problem identified .
neutral	- ve : took too long for items to arrive .
neutral	no_indication that goods weren_'_t in stock .
neutral	had to chase when items didn_'_t arrive when expected .
neutral	took 0 days to arrive in the end .
neutral	had to cancel one of the items as was needed quicker .
neutral	the order tracking on the site was useless .
neutral	if need items in a short_timescale be cautious .
neutral	however if not pressed for time then would recommend .
neutral	oneclick - please sort_out your order tracking and give indication if items are in stock and when they will be delivered .
neutral	wij hebben de afgelopen twee jaar via corendon geboekt .
neutral	ook nu hebben wij onze vakantie bij corendon geboekt .
neutral	toen wij eerder deze week de boeking online wilde maken werd de boeking tot driemaal toe om technische redenen afgebroken .
neutral	uiteindelijk verschenen er 0 verschillende boekingen in mijn emailbox .
neutral	ik_heb toen snel de_klantenservice moeten bellen om twee van_de drie boekingen ongedaan te maken .
neutral	uiteindelijk goed opgepakt en opgelost door de_klantenservice maar het gaf mij een onrustig gevoel .
neutral	vervolgens ging ik '_s morgens om 00 : 00 uur de aanbetaling regelen via ideal , om 00 : 00 uur was de aanbetaling die ik had gedaan nog niet zichtbaar in ' mijn boeking '.
neutral	vervolgens heb_ik de_klantenservice gebeld die mij de boodschap meegaf ' soms is er_een storing bij betalingen via ideal en dan duurt het een_dag '.
neutral	de_volgende ochtend direct in ' mijn boekingen ' gekeken , weer was mijn aanbetaling niet zichtbaar , dit gaf mij weer een onrustig gevoel .
neutral	vervolgens heb_ik gebeld met de_klantenservice , die gaven mij de boodschap dat_ik dan maar een screenprint van_mijn bankrekening met daarop de afschrijving moest mailen naar de administratie , wederom gaf mij dat een onrustig gevoel .
neutral	uiteindelijk kreeg ik later op_de dag een mailtje terug dat mijn aanbetaling alsnog was verwerkt .
neutral	om_een lang verhaal kort te maken , niet alleen de vakantie op_de locatie dient leuk te_zijn maar ook het voortraject in dit geval de boeking dient leuk te_zijn .
neutral	ik_heb aan_de boeking twee dagen lang een onrustig gevoel overgehouden .
neutral	annoyingly , 0 out of the last 0 items i ordered , ( hestre ski_gloves and a salomon origins air ski_helmet ), despite_being shown as in stock in the size / colour i required , turned_out not to be , and they refunded the payments .
neutral	a refund is fine , but it was the goods i wanted , not a refund .
neutral	refunds don_'_t keep your hands warm , or protect_your head if you fall over on the piste !
neutral	i would urge_anyone ordering to phone and check stock first - don_'_t rely_on website .
neutral	it would have been helpful if i had clearer or any guidance on the fuel required for the particular vehicle
neutral	ordered 0 items ; swing frame and quadpod .
neutral	the swing frame arrived in a timely_manner , without the quadpod .
neutral	there was no details of when quadpod would be delivered ; no part order reconciliation .
neutral	had to chase up order by phone .
neutral	was delivered fairly soon after chasing up .
neutral	basically poor communication .
neutral	even so , we are happy with order , and would probably order again .
neutral	the service wiggle gives is ok but on bike returns i had to wait some 0days before someone answered my very urgent problem .
neutral	when they did the service was fast and efficient .
neutral	i would use wiggle again but only for small items but for now i wait to see how soon my refund is credited .
neutral	last time you sent it to the wrong_address and caused a great nuisance to my neighbours in getting it back before you would send it to the correct address .
neutral	very happy with the product not so much with the delivery service , it clearly says orders delivered after four working_days been waiting five days now and still not been dispatched .
neutral	the ps_vita was described as 0g .
neutral	but it wasnt .
neutral	the box was but the console wasnt .
neutral	i bought a t000 laptop that should have had dvd combo fitted .
neutral	it was delivered with a dvd cdrw i emailed tier0 asking for a replacement and they did not bother to reply at all
neutral	when ordering through plumbnation i found out that you are not dealing_with one joined - up company but a call_centre which is relying on ( apparently indepedent ) distributors .
neutral	unfortunately , it does not appear that the distributors have any idea of maintaining the good service delivered by the customer face of the company .
neutral	unfortunately , my order of five radiators came from two different_locations , at different times and not within the time - frame i was expecting .
neutral	i was orginally told that my order had been delivered in full after receiving only two radiators , to find out that three more radiators were coming from a different location .
neutral	i then received one radiator which was the incorrect_size .
neutral	this was rectified but not within a timely_manner .
neutral	the delivery was also not made at the anticipated time .
neutral	the radiator was collected 0 hours before the the delivery guy came back with the correct radiator .
neutral	one grill was also damaged .
neutral	again , this was also rectified through the good work of the call - centre .
neutral	i have been a loyal_customer , i am remembered when it comes to email sales shots but time each time i order , never am i remembered .
neutral	even if i follow a link to sales from an email shot sent to me i am not recognized !
neutral	each time i have to input my details - never is there any customer recognition .
neutral	i am constantly targeted with email but never i am i offered any loyalty_rewards .
neutral	i have noticed links to mr_memory offering discount or promotion_codes .
neutral	it doesn_'_t seem to pay to be loyal to this company although the service is great !
neutral	i couldn_'_t have asked for a better delivery time as they were left_outside the recipients house around 0 . 00 in the morning so they could simply step outside and see a surprise waiting .
neutral	however the selection i chose isn_'_t exactly_what was received as some flowers were already_dying and some hadn_'_t even bloomed .
neutral	not quite sure how that makes any sense but it happened .
neutral	i had also chosen not to write a message as i had one already planned but a plain card was sent with text inside saying " the sender has not chosen to write a message " or something along those lines and the recipient just looked at me as if to say well that was pointless .
neutral	unnecessary card if you ask .
neutral	anyone overall the service was okay but i wouldn_'_t spend so much money or something i could have done better myself using a petrol_station or a supermarket .
neutral	i don_'_t consider myself to be lazy either so i would have happily done it myself but using a service like this you ' d expect something special ... not in this case i guess .
neutral	the max events day of activities was great although they decided on the day to not provide any lunch ( a bbq was described on chillisauce .)
neutral	we were told " no bbq today " without_any reason_why and with that we spent the rest of the day hungry .
neutral	people who suffer from hypoglycemia need food at regular_intervals and a venue that puts people through physical activity for a day with no proper food is irresponsible and asking for trouble .
neutral	we were miles_away from any shops so out of desperation i managed to get a pizza delivered but had to miss some activities to go meet the guy .
neutral	not a fun experience on a hangover !
neutral	i heart from some people they are not honest
neutral	...
neutral	i got stung for charges during a transfer of funds back to me .
neutral	cheeky !
neutral	......... but they don_'_t deliver to bfpo .
neutral	they do however deliver internationally now .................. just not to bfpo .
neutral	bit of a slap in the face with a wet fish really .
neutral	not a fast moving company , from my email record , over a week to be dispatched & if my memory serves me correctly then some time before delivery .
neutral	the £_00 . 00 battery arrived too late for the holiday :-(
neutral	just over a year later they ask me for a revew .
neutral	0_stars is given for a acceptable experience , which ended with the promised product being delivered in the desired quality .
neutral	if it is not common order in plentey of time .
neutral	the battery worked well this march holiday
neutral	great glasses at a great price .
neutral	eventually .
neutral	despite over 00 years successfully buying glasses online with a self measured pupillary_distance , this firm decided to take issue with it and refused to accept my measurement .
neutral	eventually they offered to take the reading from a pair of specs i already_owned , they sent me a pre_- paid_envelope and case and so i sent them a pair .
neutral	ironically , that pair was bought online from a different company with my own , and the very same , pd i offered to glasses_direct .
neutral	i don_'_t need the hassle .
neutral	i '_ll go_elsewhere next time .
neutral	if pupillary_distance is such an issue why isn_'_t it supplied as part of the prescription an optician supplies ?
neutral	purchased a camera on the basis that it had certain features as_described on the website .
neutral	but when i received the goods i asked customer_support and they said it was incorrectly advertised online .
neutral	cjs provide some of the cheapest prices found on the web for games - on that front they get 0_stars .
neutral	the problem is that i pre_- ordered cod : ghosts for pc and got some rather mixed messages .
neutral	the game description says instant delivery of the key - not true .
neutral	when i try to get my key it says it will be delivered 00_hours before release - not true .
neutral	support say it will be released in time to preload - not true ( unless you have insane (> 00mbps ) broadbnad ).
neutral	facebook says keys will come out at_0000hrs on 0th_nov - not true
neutral	key is finally available at_0000hrs
neutral	the game was cheap but the communication was rubbish - if they had just said upfront that i would get it a few hours before release i would be happy and have ordered , instead they give the impression before you order you will get it ' instantly ' in reality it was 0 days_later .
neutral	be honest guys and you will have a customer for a long time ( if you keep the prices this great !
neutral	).

neutral	got back to leeds_bradford after a weeks skiing and couldn_'_t get out the car_park .
neutral	i had pre_- paid and had printed out my booking form but it said details would be forwarded , but they weren_'_t .
neutral	if it wasn_'_t for a friendly car_park bus driver who arrived on the scene after a 00_minutes wait i would still be there now !
neutral	i thought i was a hard phone case when i bought the item , but was disappointed when i discovered it was a sticker that didn_'_t fit the die - cut aperture was not in the right position .
neutral	hotel not as good as expected - looked in need of a refurb , but the staff were friendly & the food good .
neutral	the network itself has decent coverage , although the 0g_signal is not as good in certain_areas as other_networks .
neutral	i found customer_services were quite unhelpful when experiencing problems tethering on my iphone
neutral	myprotein offers good quality protein at a hugely competitive price - it is a pity that their free delivery catered for by yodel is absolutely_appalling .
neutral	my last four orders have been delivered by this company and even_though the instructions were to leave the box at the reception to my flat complex if i am not in , every_single time the delivery company has just left the boxes outside .
neutral	if it were not for this , myprotein would be getting 0_stars !
neutral	its been 0 week since its daipatched and i am still_waiting for the cartds ro arrive :/
neutral	purchased pure evoke 0s digital_radio with an apparent fault when unit switched on .
neutral	excellent communication up to and including delivery .
neutral	when i returned the item 0 days_later , however , they would not send a replacement until the fault was identified , totally_unacceptable as i had only just purchased and returned the item .
neutral	eventually received a refund as they were out of stock .
neutral	can do a better job didn_'_t put much thought into what the was ordered nothing like ad or picture .
neutral	i must_admit that the products received were a little more used than_expected .
neutral	as an ex_demo i expected a few scratches here and there .
neutral	apart_from the 0 year_warranty there is not real difference than buying on ebay .
neutral	some pictures of the real products would have been useful .
neutral	i just hope that i get a long service from what i consider to be a quality brand of tools ( metabo )
neutral	love the text_alert and automated_message with a 00 hr warning but not getting an am or pm or a date is not great when you won_'_t be in .
neutral	if argos do your deliveries , why was it yodel ?
neutral	!
neutral	partner ordered a chair for me for my bday 0_weeks in advance , got told was guna b 0 days then had a phone_call saying it was out of stock and b no_longer_than a week ( no_problems , plenty of time to get here for my bday ) actually ended_up being 0_weeks !
neutral	this was after various calls to 0000 numbers which has cost me god_knows in phone_calls .
neutral	caravanning round the uk i was looking for a network that supported iphone & gave good service .
neutral	o0 has done this though i am surprised with the various ' blackspots ' in coverage in scotland & middle england compared to my wife who '_s phone is orange .
neutral	quality / depth of service is certainly better_than hers when we both have signal but she has signal more often than i
neutral	well impressive online offer if you bought 0 tyres , so i did and booked appointment .
neutral	to only receive an email to call regards my order - only two tyres in stock left , probably be a month until new stock of same tyre !
neutral	alternative offered at a whooping £_000 more !
neutral	so no option but to get the two fitted and get a refund for the other two , but as i got refunded less_than half back , will have to save up for full_amount !
neutral	no apology or offer of half the amount back as a good will gesture ?
neutral	?
neutral	on a positive_note i would definitely use ' national_tyres spon end , coventry ' again as service was first_class a very ' can do ', professional and friendly service .
neutral	very fast turnround .
neutral	price great with my discount_voucher . content quality fine_except for the full a0 pages and cover which were disappointing with striations in the blue sky . though the church were happy i was not and would think_twice befor i used this service from jessops .
neutral	was quoted between £_000 and £_000 , then the price came in at £_000 plus_vat !!
neutral	i was then harassed to make a decision on whether i wanted my information !
neutral	been full flu and with a number of other projects pressing i needed more time to consider the price .
neutral	at this point steve became pushy and when i told_him to back off he hung_up on me ( i did swear but not at him !).
neutral	i called straight back to talk to a manager and spoke to jason , who after listening to me , offered a reduced price , in line with my original quote .
neutral	on calling back my intention was just to have my hard_drive returned and frankly i wanted nothing more to do with the company but jason saved the day .
neutral	in terms of data , all was there that i required , 00 %.
neutral	cant_fault the data retrieval but the customer service and quoting was questionable at first .
neutral	the service is prompt and the canvas_prints are great quality .
neutral	unfortunately on this occasion , we were sent the wrong order .
neutral	however , when we phoned to explain the situation , a member of staff apologised and arranged pick_up of the wrong item and our actual order was delivered the next week .
neutral	we were quite excited when ilumi appeared as it seemed that they had so many positive things to offer .
neutral	unfortunately reality did not match our expectations .
neutral	we ' re vegetarians and found our choices to be very limited and , a year later , we still find the selection to be too small .
neutral	also small is the pack size , great size for a snack or a child '_s meal but not for an adult .
neutral	whilst we would be prepared to " live " with bland tasting food , as that '_s easy to remedy at home , we are much more challenged by the packs all tasting as if they are over - cooked .
neutral	for us , the food is too soft but perfect for someone with no teeth !
neutral	:-)
neutral	we have tried the most_recent offerings and , sorry to say , all of the above still applies .
neutral	overall , we would rather see no discounts and the money saved by not offering those discounts put into increasing the pack size .
neutral	less of an over - cooked feel may be more difficult as we guess this level of cooking may be necessary to ensure that the packs can be stored in the kitchen_cupboard or desk drawer .
neutral	great idea for a range of food , regrettably not for us although we will sample from time to time to see if things change to better meet our expectations .
neutral	i was pleased with the products and prices but the time between ordering and delivery was 0_weeks which was too far long .
neutral	i ended_up having to purchase half the products elsewhere which defeated the object of ordering in the first place !
neutral	it would have been helpful to have received an email to explain that they were waiting on one item so i could have cancelled the order but i wasn_'_t given this information until i emailed asking where my order was !
neutral	i can '_t complain_about the service i received with you , easy to order and quick delivery , but the drills i ordered were not up to the job and all broke after a few attempts .
neutral	goods arrived from uk tools in good condition but 0 days_later than the one hour time_slot stated by interlink_express . as i had to cancel urgent appointments to be there at the stated time i was not at all impressed especially as they didnt even have the courtesy to tell me . this inevitably reflects_badly on uk_tool_centre as the ultimate supplier .
neutral	all that seems to good to be true usually is too good to be true .
neutral	been waiting over 0_weeks now for the money to arrive .
neutral	phone was received by them before the end of march .
neutral	the company made some excuse that they cant send the cheques all out at once , sounds_like a cashflow problem to me .
neutral	update .
neutral	the owner mark went out of his way to put my money in the bank within an_hour of him learning of my problem , i have revised my original review to reflect the good handling albeit late of the person in charge ,
neutral	thumbs_up for better service after a bad start .
neutral	i went for the ' make deluxe ' option , so i wonder what the ordinary version would look like ?
neutral	i expected a few more blooms .
neutral	made an order , which arrived ok , but had to return as to small .
neutral	i enclosed the returns paperwork requesting a larger_size and had the confirmation_email that they had depatched the item but on the email they had depatched the item to the incorrect_address ( as they had my old address set_up as the default address ), so i rang them straight_away to let them know that they had made this error .
neutral	still_waiting for the item to arrive ?
neutral	first of all will say that the service from workwearexpress was second to none .
neutral	from placing the order , reviewing the artwork to the actual delivery was very professional .
neutral	but , the sizes of my garments has left me a little_confused .
neutral	trousers , 0 pairs at esmall - perfect
neutral	shirts x0 at esmall - perfect
neutral	sweatshirt x0 at esmall - miles to big
neutral	fleece x0 at esmall - couldn_'_t even get my arms in the sleeves !
neutral	so , out of 0 products , all ordered at the same size , 0 were perfect , 0 was miles to big and 0 was miles to small ?
neutral	we were so late , and phoned ahead to be told that the ferry was also late by 00_mins so not to worry .
neutral	once we got there we were told we had missed it - must have been by seconds .
neutral	we could see it and it seem to stay there for ages .
neutral	anyway 0 hours_later we_boarded the next one , and then ate the worst fish and chips i have ever had .
neutral	good is you can grab a great bargain
neutral	bad is if you are not careful , chances are you will be conned by some dodgy person of your hard_earned_money !
neutral	if you don_'_t pay by paypal then your money will be lost for sure !
neutral	the web_site is very easy to use and not a bad price .
neutral	but living in leicestershire and sending to the isle of man i have no idea weather they have got there .
neutral	an email to confirm that they have been delivered would just make the hole better .
neutral	go - electrical offered the best price for the roberts digital clock radio which i wanted .
neutral	the internet record showed that they had 0 in stock so i placed an order on 00 december .
neutral	00 days_later i wondered what had happened as i had not received any updates so i looked at the website to see if there was any information .
neutral	apparently 0 in stock , maybe they were swamped just before_christmas but recent reviews were showing that deliveries were taking place quickly .
neutral	christmas_eve after sending go - electrical a message they told me they were waiting for a delivery from roberts .
neutral	i think the messages crossed rather_than there message being a response to mine .
neutral	i would recommend not relying too much on what the web_site says about the product being in stock .
neutral	just after christmas when the item was received the delivery went impressively well .
neutral	the website information from dpd about where the parcel had got too was impressively good .
neutral	so much so we could have a cup of tea ready for the delivery driver when he arrived .
neutral	if the product had been in stock or the website told me it wasn_'_t it would have been a 0_star_rating .
neutral	no place to wait for your car , people were standing in the rain .
neutral	slow for the cars to come up , quicker to go on the bus to mid term
neutral	i ordered the flowers , and was impressed by the speedy delivery and the emails i received notifying_me of there dispatch from the depot to the delivery address .
neutral	however when speaking to my girlfriend about the flowers she said that one of the roses was just a stork , without a flowers head .
neutral	also the rst of the roses were not of a high_standard relating to the price .
neutral	the lillie '_s were ok and looked to be in good shape , however they did not last that long . i had to supplemented them from asda with lillie '_s that cost £ 0 . 00 !
neutral	and they out ; lasted the serenata ones by 0 days !
neutral	call plans are ok if your a home customer , choice of phones is average but worst of all is customer_services - it '_s ridiculous trying to sort a problem , get answers etc .
neutral	recently went in to comet to purchase a new washing_machine .
neutral	the experience had it '_s good points and it '_s bad points !!!
neutral	!
neutral	the washer was good value , delivery was free and they took my old one away .
neutral	the sales_rep was ridiculously pushy , constantly trying to push us to a more_expensive washer despite telling them our budget .
neutral	at the checkout he tried for 00_minutes to get us to take out extended_warranty - in the end i said i would think about it so we could leave !
neutral	0 hour later i received a phone_call asking if i was ready to take out the extended_warranty and he wasn_'_t best pleased when i said no .
neutral	overall : good value , shame about the pushy_sales .
neutral	goods ordered were received quite quickly , and i was happy with the goods themselves .
neutral	since i am resident in the channel_islands , upon delivery i requested a refund of the vat component of the purchase price ( since vat is not applicable for goods supplied here ).
neutral	this request was agreed by customer_care within 0 . 0 hours , and i duly awaited a refund back to my credit_card .
neutral	sadly , it then took 0 months , and another 0 sets of requests - the responses to each of which informed that the accounts_dept .
neutral	would process the refund as a matter of urgency - to finally resolve the issue .
neutral	overall , i would have to think long & hard before using them again .
neutral	black_circles sell tyres at very good prices and previously i have had excellent service too but on this occasion i was contacted to say that the fitting at the garage would have to be delayed as , although the tyres were in stock they could not deliver them .
neutral	i aaid fine and arranged to borrow a car as i had to leave my car at the garage .
neutral	the tyres did not arrive and the appointment had to be rebooked for a second time , now 00 days since i ordered them .
neutral	due to be fitted on saturday , not convenient for me but i need the tyres .
neutral	heres_hoping its third time lucky .
neutral	two items of the order were not delivered to the requested room .
neutral	the reason given was that due to health and safety rules they could not lift items above waist height .
neutral	surely this needs to be looked at as this was not communicated prior to the delivery and makes me question how you are able complete the delivery of a number of your items and commit to the service being promised .
neutral	he arrived early and got straight to work .
neutral	just a service so an easy job .
neutral	not impressed he left muddy foot prints all over my kitchen_floor and even managed to get dirt and mud on my freshly painted kitchen walls .
neutral	fast service and delivery
neutral	the rental company was away from the airport and we had to telephone them to come to collect us .
neutral	this took about 00_minutes .
neutral	after that , the paperwork seemed to take an age , and the guy in the office grumbled about holiday_autos giving me a free second driver .
neutral	on our return we had to pay £_00 for a hardly noticible scuff on the hubcap which may or may not have been there before we picked_up the car .
neutral	having said that we got a good car for our money and the online booking and follow - ups were efficient although i could have done without the persistent nagging about taking up their excess_insurance .
neutral	ordered before 00 : 00 .
neutral	e_- mailed me to inform_me of next_day delivery but arrived 00_hours_later than scheduled .
neutral	not sure if courier was at fault .
neutral	but no follow - up e_- mail from simply baby to explain the delivery would be delayed or apologising for late delivery ,
neutral	merchandise spot on but the delivery was a shambles waited in for two_days because they said th delivery was one day then the next arrived day 0
neutral	this is the first time i have used bulk_powders , referred from men '_s health .
neutral	the ordering was simple and fast though done if the tick_boxes were so out of place on the product pages i had to sit and workout what flavour i was ordering .
neutral	i asked for guaranteed next_day delivery but sadly , due to an internal error on bulk_powders part and an issue with parcelforce it took 0 working_days .
neutral	i had to call bulk_powders 0 times and each time was treated very well , but they were calls i shouldn_'_t have had to make .
neutral	great company , great products but my experience has_been muddied by the delivery and personal effort i had to put into getting me delivery .
neutral	as always my protein was great on price and product , however false statements on product descriptions and refusal to refund 0 products i ordered and did not need as a result of their mistake , let them down completely and i was left very frustrated .
neutral	they really didn_'_t seem to care that i was annoyed with their service either .
neutral	also beware of their points system , it '_s very poorly ran , my account had gone into minus figures , and i had saved numerous points whicheck theh wiped at the end of the year without warning ( it does say in the t &_c '_s but a warning would have been nice ...) if ordering from these just make_sure you are 000_% certain with your order before you place it as you can '_t edit an order after paying .
neutral	you have to cancel , get a refund and order again !!
neutral	very annoying company but great products and price .
neutral	arrived for breakfast at 000am , member of staff crossed my name off but that was the only contact staff made .
neutral	i wanted a veggie breakfast as advertised but non was on offer .
neutral	there was no staff around to ask how breakfast works & another guest showed me where to get tea and coffee from .
neutral	the hotel is sited well for airport and bus 000 from airport goes reasonably close .
neutral	a 00 min_walk from the bus_stop .
neutral	if you have heavy bags you might want to take a cab .
neutral	security / bed good .
neutral	no window to open .
neutral	the main_reason to purchase was price , customer service ok but after 0_weeks of hearing_nothing i had to chase a delivery date & was never given a reason_why it appears my order was forgotten .
neutral	liberty bathrooms however did not forget to take my money promptly .
neutral	well i bought a yamaha np 00 from ebay and it was supposed to arrive on thursday but it hadnt arrive so i phoned inter linked and said they hadnt recived the order so i phoned fair deal music and told me they had the purchase but hadnt send the order and said they will send it for tuesday week after thursday hoping it '_ll come
neutral	booking the appointment and the fitting were by two completely
neutral	different_departments .
neutral	booking the visit was pointless .
neutral	i originally booked for the the tuesday .
neutral	i was telephoned the day after i ' d booked and told the tyres wouldn_'_t be at the branch until the thursday .
neutral	also , could i ' phone the branch on the thursday_morning to make_sure the tyres were there .
neutral	when i ' phoned the branch they had no knowledge of my appointment and had to ' phone me back to comfirm the appointment .
neutral	the branch was faultless , though i did have to wait about 00_minutes which i would have done if i ' d just turned_up .
neutral	i had thought that by making an online booking i would have been fitted in straight_away without the wait .
neutral	therefore when i need new tyres in future i shall just call into my local_branch and take my turn , which i did anyway .
neutral	online booking i give 0_stars , local_branch 0_stars ( because of the wait ) hence the rating at the top !
neutral	could not fault the service , flowers looke fine , however when i arrived home to see them , i asked my fiance where she had put the rest of them , but there were no more .
neutral	i ordered online initially with my irish visa_debit_card - order accepted , no problem .
neutral	email next_day to say the order was declined as my address was different to my postal ( uk ) address - they had still taken the money out but cancelled the order .
neutral	i called and they explained this was for my protection ?
neutral	i next paid on my uk visa_card , order accepted again online - no problem , money debited from my card .
neutral	0 days_later i got an email_saying they wanted proof of my address before they ' d release the order for delivery - again for my " security ".
neutral	my order was 0 days late as a result of all this - the tiles are great and look great , but the customer_relations is very icy and security a bit over the top .
neutral	why do they need all this security - after all they ' d already had two payments from my cards ?
neutral	delivery excellent , do not expect as much when returning items .
neutral	recently_purchased a guitar_amp from these_guys .
neutral	the amp was shipped in only the manufacturers cardboard_box which offered minimal protection and , as a result , several of the plastic corner ' bumpers ' were broken on arrival .
neutral	obviously this is partly the manufacturers fault for poorly packaging the product in the first place but i would have thought it would have been obvious to the vendor that damage was highly likely in the courier system and they would have double_boxed it .
neutral	bought tickets for springsteen at cardiff millenium stadium .
neutral	all went well , but tickets priced at more than double gate price .
neutral	only bought because wife really keen to go .
neutral	wouldn_'_t use viagogo again .
neutral	no furtther comments !
neutral	i have always found valueshop deliver the correct order in a timely_fashion .
neutral	i used to get a 0 %_discount for subsequent orders but that seems to have stopped now .
neutral	p_&_p_charges are an issue .
neutral	i prefer to order larger_quantities to spread the cost of p_&_p but the cost doubles when you spend £_00 , even_though one extra ink_cartridge probably doesn_'_t add much weight .
neutral	good company , good deals and service but not always the strongest signal .
neutral	i believe that amazon '_s own service is always excellent .
neutral	the only potential area for improvement is the service offered through 0rd_party vendors .
neutral	not always as consistent as amazon itself .
neutral	i ordered a silver tuxedo for a cruise .
neutral	it said delivery in three working_days .
neutral	when i rang to chase it up i was informed that it was not kept in stock and the supplier was on holiday until the 0th_jan .
neutral	my cruise leaves on the 0th .
neutral	however they accepted the cancellation and refunded the money quickly .
neutral	its great to able to find the items i like at a better_than high_street price .
neutral	as buying shirts would prefer to have a better description of the collar ie large / small as i have brought the wrong items a couple of times .
neutral	maybe a larger magnified picture would help .
neutral	packing in a box would be better as these are supposedly more_expensive items of clothing .
neutral	not only are the items poorly protected , visually the presentation is bad , everyone wants things to look nice surely .
neutral	despatch really good , product does what it is supposed to do .
neutral	courier a problem , advice said city_link who '_s website did not recognise the courier number .
neutral	i had an e_mail from interlink which i did not read because i had not ordered anything via that company , however i went_onto there website where my number was recognised .
neutral	there local driver had been to the wrong adress and left a card ( the parcel adress was perfect ).
neutral	local interlink sorted it at last and i collected .
neutral	good service let_down by the carrier .
neutral	... unfortunately i got a phone_call shortly_after finalising my online purchase and fitting date to say that in fact the tyres weren_'_t in stock and wouldn_'_t be able to be fitted until 0 - 0 days_later .
neutral	so the website booking system isn_'_t perfect , but if you ' re like me and like to confirm arrangements with a real_person , you '_ll phone to check things with the fitting_centre anyway .
neutral	having said all this , they offer the biggest range of tyres i could_find on the web , with clear info & the best prices .
neutral	word of advice though - check your tyre spec with your insurer & manufacturer & don_'_t just copy what '_s on the vehicle already .
neutral	i was happy with product but was no happy because i payed extra for before 00am delivery and they arrived at 00 . 00 i will not use this company again
neutral	the drink_shop has an amazing product range , if you want it , hey have it .
neutral	prices are about right especially as many items can '_t be bought anywhere_else .
neutral	delivery charges have always felt a little high , especially for one bottle .
neutral	perhaps a discount or free delivery at a certain order level ?
neutral	what '_s more annoying and doesn_'_t help your perception is delivery timescales .
neutral	sure , i can pay for next_day delivery for a lot more money which is fine as that '_s what the courier charges , but if i place an order using the cheapest delivery you should despatch same day rather_than make me wait and despatch 0 / 0 working_days_later because that '_s the delivery service i paid for .
neutral	other_companies won_'_t guarantee a delivery date unless you pay but will despatch asap meaning it probably will get to me earlier but no guarantee .
neutral	please don_'_t sit on the orders ....
neutral	why did you send me 0 different products ?
neutral	as in different manufactures .
neutral	disappointed as one of the products is not effective at all .
neutral	the fact the drug is the same , does not mean the manufacture is any good .
neutral	when providing this product , you should let people know who is the manufacture .
neutral	this is a bit of a con , had i know this i would not have made the purchase .
neutral	no , not all drugs are the same , and some have better results than others .
neutral	good value contract and excellent free virgin to virgin calls but the foreign call_centre is appaling .
neutral	if you can get through to the uk call_centre then they are extremely knowledgable and helpful .
neutral	fitted quickly , but drove_off with the steering off centre .
neutral	complained and told that tracking was extra .
neutral	i said i did not mind this but why on earth was i allowed to drive off without being offered this ....?
neutral	see_above lack of any instrusctions
neutral	paymemt made immediately but not traced until i reminder them i had paid . order therefore was delayed by three_weeks
neutral	fundamentally it is a great service , but the machine on arrival back was broken , which appears to be a common problem .
neutral	i also bought a coffee to travel back with , only to be told by the driver that i couldn_'_t take it on the bus , so that was a waste .
neutral	wish i had known before .
neutral	on arrival at hire car desk we were given the option of a fiat_000 or a vw beetle .
neutral	on booking we were told we would be given a ford_focus or similar so we were a bit surprised at the offer of a fiat_000 !
neutral	we decided to go with the beetle which thankfully turned_out to be a nice car .
neutral	it would have been even nicer if budget had valeted the car in advance !
neutral	i didn_'_t fully understand at the time but i went for the pre_- paid fuel option which meant that i could return the car with an almost empty_tank .
neutral	i returned it with a full_tank so budget did rather well in that respect .
neutral	i feel that this could have been better and more concisely explained to me at the time .
neutral	i did feel that the chap_who dealt_with me at the pick - up just wanted rid of me as soon as possible !
neutral	dropping the car off was easy and well_signposted .
neutral	the gentleman that dealt_with us was polite , courteous and efficient .
neutral	he pointed_out about the full_tank of fuel and said that if i could prove that i ' d purchased the fuel ( show receipts ) i would be able to re - coup the cost .
neutral	i didn_'_t have the receipts to hand at that point so declined his offer .
neutral	i don_'_t know if this is something that i can do retrospectively ?
neutral	overall the car was great to drive and would use car_hire 0000 again .
neutral	my girlfriend was over the moon with the flowers , so can '_t complain .
neutral	however , after struggling to pay via the internet and having to change browsers to make payment work i then chose a ' heart ' card with message .
neutral	the card arrived and was just a folded piece of card with no heart image with my message , so feel a bit misled .
neutral	the destination for the flowers was brazil and although they turned_up lovely , they only lasted 0 days .
neutral	personally i feel the 00 red_roses was too expensive for this final_outcome , but they arrived and my girlfriend was happy .
neutral	products are okay but then service needs to be more professional .
neutral	paid extra for next working day .
neutral	ordered thurs , delivered tues ( mon & fri were bank hols ), but since parcel_force deliver on sats , it shouldve arrived on sat .
neutral	called gearforgirls stating that i wasnt happy , but they quite_frankly were not interested .
neutral	so i suspect their after - sales arent very good .
neutral	having said that , the item was packaged well and as_described .
neutral	generally good however the stitching is already going on the inside of the pocket after a couple of wears and the sleeves are slightly shorter_than i would have liked .
neutral	ordered frontline - 0 packs .
neutral	received only one despite having paid for two .
neutral	problem resolved with no_hassle but clearly should not have happened in the first place .
neutral	havent decided if i '_ll use this company again .
neutral	will think about it in a few_months time when i run out of frontline ...
neutral	i ordered some replacement bulbs for my christmas_lights online on 00 / 00 ; which i appreciate is near christmas .
neutral	however , they arrived on the 00th_january , having only been despatched on the 0th_january ; well after christmas .
neutral	the order confirmation said they were " in the dispatch process to be delivered shortly 0 - 0 working_days by courier " at point of order which was rather mis_- leading .
neutral	from the delivery note it looks_like they were in fact back ordered from a supplier and it would have been helpful to know that at point of order and in this case i would have bought elsewhere because of the urgency .
neutral	i have not had the chance of inspecting my purchase yet ... despatched on the 0nd still_waiting on the 00th
neutral	spoilt birthday_gift
neutral	we pay for delivery it has_been a failure in terms of purchase
neutral	use a reliable carrier
neutral	the initial order delivery i received had a 00g bottle of rosa mosqueta instead of 00g .
neutral	i sent an email pointing_out the error .
neutral	later i phoned to check they had received my email and asked if it was alright to ship 0 more 00g bottles to make up the order , which i accepted .
neutral	so only issue really is that they didn_'_t do that in the first place !
neutral	service was great , always able to get through with any_queries .
neutral	always did what they said they would do .
neutral	let_down by a shoddy product , i guess you get what you pay for .
neutral	the shed £_000 was poorly put_together and broken in areas .
neutral	the sides were warped and nails hanging out in places .
neutral	radiator is perfect for my needs , and a very fair price but i had to wait 0_weeks after being told the wait would be 0_weeks .
neutral	rather disappointing
neutral	using the web_site was easy and helpful but my experience of national_tyres customer service was poor .
neutral	they were inflexible and i was made to feel awkward because i was 00mins later than planned in arriving for tyres_fitted .
neutral	the tyre_fitter wouldn_'_t move a used tyre from front to back at the same time as he was fitting new tyres ...... he said he ' d have to charge me for that .
neutral	poor customer service at national_tyres , their attitude was like they were doing me a favour and i was the paying customer !
neutral	the cabins and ship was nice .
neutral	but i think you should keep hen and stag dos apart_from other couples which are there for a different experience . we also found getting off the boat at each end was a pain .
neutral	we had to wait around like_cattle just to get off the boat which made our stay short in amsterdam .
neutral	so we never got to see what we wanted to .
neutral	i would like to thank_you for the experience but if i want to go back to amsterdam ill fly
neutral	i did not feel the item justified the retail price of 00 . 00
neutral	car_rental from hm rent - a - car dubrovnik in sept_0000 .
neutral	the car had not been washed / cleaned before delivery .
neutral	lots of minor_damage and scrapes which i was expected to observe and ensure were recorded prior to taking car ... made me uneasy that i might be charged later for unnoticed damage ... and believe me the car was very carefully examined upon return !
neutral	you can expect to be charged for damage_caused before your rental if you don_'_t spot it in advance .
neutral	scam !
neutral	i ' d advise several careful time & date recorded photos of a car '_s condition prior to hire .
neutral	the car i was given had a loose rattling rear number_plate and the wipers needed to be replaced .
neutral	fuel_policy is that the fuel level is noted at time of hire and you ' re expected to return it with the same fuel level .
neutral	more scam opportunity !
neutral	all hire_cars should be delivered and returned with full tanks and economycarrentals should not use hire_companies that don_'_t have this fuel_policy .
neutral	ordered some roses for valentines_day and although the delivery and overall service was good the actual flowers looked a bit worn and tired which was bit_disappointing .
neutral	you were recommended by a friend .
neutral	the original product i wanted was not available so i bought a lower spec usb_flash_drive .
neutral	compared to competitor prices gizzmo is high ( even with the offer it '_s over 0 * more_expensive ) and the delivery was slower ( eg i often get it the next_day ), so although gizzmo might appeal to technical specialist i do think it needs to offer something unique to encourage people like me back .
neutral	i purchased the flowers for my wife '_s birthday with a discount_voucher so value for money was excellent but i didn_'_t receive an email on the day as i was supposed to , the flowers didn_'_t arrive until 0 . 00 so i waited in all day for nothing & the surprise for my wife was spoilt because by that time i ' d thought they weren_'_t going to arrive & had told her about them so i was left a little disappointed to say the least
neutral	the price i paid for my barbour gilet was a price i though it was worth despite it being dramatically_reduced in the sale .
neutral	there '_s no way i would have paid the full price however if i did , the order processing and delivery time would have been the same which weren_'_t brilliant .
neutral	average delivery time however this , plus a strange delay between ordering and dispatch seemed a long time .
neutral	on its own an fair performace , when compared to other online_retailers no better or worse .
neutral	i am unluck enough to be in an area where i have little choice but bt , expensive and setting_up was a nightmare , was without a number for weeks .
neutral	on balance for a rural_area 0meg speed aint bad .
neutral	i have been a big tesco consumer but recent experience with there credit_card has changed my mind , i was forced to have a low limit ( 0 . 0 x less then i was offered with my bank ) but because of double club card points i took out the card .
neutral	i kept being charged fee '_s i could do nothing about that more then cancelled out the fees , trying to phone them was a nightmare as they seem to share lines with little woods ... go figure .
neutral	rubish , won_'_t be re - insuring my car with them out of principle and shop there rarely now ( before i spen approx_£_000 a week + £_00_-£_00 on fuel ).
neutral	your loss tesco .
neutral	really efficient , booked the tickets on the user_friendly website without issue and they arrived really quickly .
neutral	however i thought the admin , postal , service charges were very high , with two £_00 originally priced tickets coming to £_000 .
neutral	but in all happy with viagogo .
neutral	as long as you don_'_t expect them to stock any of the stuff they advertise on the website they are ok for the odd deal .
neutral	however , my local_store has got into a bad habit of pushing certain brands ( do they get a bonus for this ?)
neutral	which can make in - store browsing a bit tiresome ( have you considered an lg sir ?).
neutral	note to self , always wear headphones when entering shop to drown out the sales_pitch :)
neutral	great prices if you are close enough to pop_into the store to avoid postal_charges .
neutral	the only black_mark is the amount of grey_import stuff they sell which means any warranty may be with scan rather_than the manufacturer ( samsung disk drives are a case in point ).
neutral	i haven_'_t had to return anything yet so i can '_t comment on their customer service .
neutral	great prices if you wait for a sale , but the quality of their gear varies wildly .
neutral	i '_ve had walking boot from them that have started to fall_apart in a week , and others that will probably outlive me !
neutral	i '_m no fan of their ' discount card ' gimmick either , but the sheer range of goods they stock instore keeps me going back and the staff are always very helpful .
neutral	i stopped using this company a few_years_ago after a very poor experience trying to send back a faulty motherboard .
neutral	they insisted that i had to accept a repair rather_than a refund ( on a brand_new item ) and refused to accept the law of the land that states i should have the choice of a full_refund .
neutral	it '_s a shame as i keep seeing links to gear on their site at very tempting prices .
neutral	maybe i should give them another go but once_bitten ...
neutral	a couple of years_ago i would have given screwfix 0_stars , but prices keep rising in relation to other_sellers , stock_levels haven_'_t kept up with the product range and the discounts given at the new ' trade_counter ' are being paid for by everyone on the other side of the dividing wall ( cheers for that !).
neutral	add to this constant issues with account numbers changing and it '_s just not the same as it was before the takeover .
neutral	i still use them when i have to , but begrudgingly now rather_than happily :(
neutral	another convenient store that repeatedly fails on stock_levels , partly_because the way they store stuff means if they say they have 00 in stock , 00 are probably broken / missing / on a pallet somewhere_else .
neutral	at_least the big stores store some of the wood horizontally , unlike wickes where 00_% of it is warped and twisted !
neutral	another gripe is the new ' trade_counter ' that means if you are buying 00 sheets of plasterboard from a b + q warehouse and don_'_t have a trade card , you now have to lug the stuff through the old dears buying begonias to pay at the normal till !
neutral	i use tesco every week as it '_s convenient .
neutral	scratch that , it '_s not just convenient it '_s everywhere !
neutral	from a point of view of customer experience they are better_than the co - op ( where do they get their staff ?)
neutral	but still found wanting compared to other stores .
neutral	maybe a little staff training is in order , or possibly just give them more money ?
neutral	i bought the witcher 0 off you guys .
neutral	it took about 0 - 0 days after it had released for me to be able to play it though .
neutral	if next time you get the games ready for download on the release day , you would get a 0_star_review and a few more customers .
neutral	sadly the product did not work our as hoped for so returned .
neutral	paperwork for return was very efficient and communications were good .
neutral	status from 00 days ago ( 00 / 0 / 00 ) was good received .
neutral	refund not yet made .....?( 00 / 0 / 00 ).
neutral	i hope it will be done by end of the month !
neutral	nothing wrong with the blinds but the incessant advertising has put me off using them again
neutral	looked for some good value tyres and found them on the national web_site .
neutral	two for one on avon .
neutral	checked with their online help to make_sure ok for my jag x type .
neutral	called local centre for price to compare with web .
neutral	centre was 0p cheaper .
neutral	howeven none in stock .
neutral	so waited for avon delivery , called again - still none delivered .
neutral	ordered on web for fitting at this centre - gave them 0 days to get tyres .
neutral	hope they are there when i arrive .
neutral	running on a space_saver at the moment .
neutral	will also take the opportunity to get my front pirrelli zeros checked as i keep having to put more air in them every other week .
neutral	good templates for my purposes , which are mainly to communicate with friends across the world .
neutral	i use my website as a glorified blog , holding old photographs and background information as well as maintaining a blog .
neutral	the option to email key people after each update is good .
neutral	navigating between pages is sometimes hard work .
neutral	on oa couple of occasions i have lost work by inadvertantly coming out of a section when lost - a better auto save option , rather_than the full save & review , would help .
neutral	======== ok ==========
neutral	ordered 00th , supposed delivery 00th , then told by parcelforce 00th , contacted both company and parcelforce ( parcelforce 0 times today by phone , twice by email , westin '_s line had switched to an answer phone by 0pm ), order finally delivered sat am , not to the right house ( yes we were in ), but 00 is close enough !
neutral	have to say i have no idea why parcelforce can '_t understand the instructions when they are plastered in a large label on the top of the box " perishable - do not return to depot ".
neutral	now contacted their customer_services by their emailed ' ticket ' system and await their response to wether the meat is indeed consumable still as it is right at the limit of the 00_hours and all the packing had melted .
neutral	sadly , our first order and a terrible experience .
neutral	amended to 0_stars from 0 : as i said , to be fair to westin , they seem to have been let_down by parcelforce .
neutral	a week_later , a ticket opened with customer service , and answered , and one phone_call and a refund agreed without_any quibble .
neutral	if it was just westin i had had to deal with i ' d certainly have given 0 or 0 .
neutral	placed three orders and sent together , recived payment within two_days .
neutral	did not pay full price for all phones .
neutral	during the ordering_process , there is a section ' special delivery instructions ' - i duly stated that if i was out to leave the parcel in my garden under the patio or in greenhouse .
neutral	image my frustration when i got home on 00nd_may to find a returned to depot card from royal_mail_stating it was too large for letterbox .
neutral	i asked for it to be redelivered via internet but also expressed my unhappiness to the post lady the next_day - especially as there was a specific request to leave in my garden .
neutral	the parcel was duly redelivered but i had to eat humble_pie when the postlady pointed_out that all that was showing on the parcel was my address and no other instructions !
neutral	so what was the point of asking !
neutral	thankfully i got the medals in time for my event but feel you should be aware of my experience .
neutral	i was confused at first , but once you weed through the b . s .
neutral	their are some good deals . waiting to see how long it takes for delivery .
neutral	always good that we could talk to a real_person - the woman_who answered the phone , politely & promptly .
neutral	but - we had some technical problems & she always went off to ' ask someone '.
neutral	it was not until several calls later , were we able to talk directly to an engineer who , immediately , was able to solve our problem / query .
neutral	this involved the lack of a suitable connector for the replacement pump with the hose .
neutral	why was the connector not sold with the pump , as had been done originally ?
neutral	supplier was europcar gatwick_north .
neutral	all was routine except that after driving away i found an empty drink bottle rolling around the floor along with an empty samosa bag .
neutral	overall it seemed the car was not cleaned after the last hire
neutral	had a string of successful transactions and then one that tracked but the money never came through .
neutral	i felt duped in all honesty .
neutral	i bought a product ( car insurance ) in good faith and the money ( around £_00 ) the vendor i was expecting never arrived .
neutral	when i chased it i discovered it was ' sorry too late to do anything mate '.
neutral	i won_'_t be using that insurer again and haven_'_t used this website since - why should i when it is clearly hit and miss .
neutral	i may as well go direct to the insurer and haggle for a better price and definitely get a discount .
neutral	you ' re only as good as your last transaction topcashback .
neutral	i may still come_back to your site ( for stuff where there is no scope for haggling e . g .
neutral	consumer electronics ) and use it but once_bitten twice_shy .
neutral	sorry .
neutral	somebody has my cash_back money and i '_m not happy about it .
neutral	the only redress i will accept is to get back what i was promised , but no chance of that .
neutral	ordered a shower redring active 000s 0 kw which is still shown on the fastlec web_site but was sent a different model redring active a0 0kw .
neutral	although they had my email address the only time i found out about the substitute shower was when it arrived and i queried why they had sent this model .
neutral	my customer had wanted the 000s model and i now have to return the a0 and try elswhere to find the correct model .
neutral	everything was fine , flowers were as nice as i expected however the card which meant to go with it didn_'_t arrive which made it ' an anonymous gift '.
neutral	the service is fine but the site can be a bit_confusing .
neutral	the filters aren_'_t very clear .
neutral	prices are pretty good though !
neutral	a huge price to go with them .
neutral	definately shop around ( don_'_t forget that alienware are owned by dell ).
neutral	you '_ll get a similar spec machine for a good few_hundred_pounds elsewhere but it won_'_t look as pretty !
neutral	i was unlucky .
neutral	i asked for a delivery to another address but paid by paypal but nothing warned me that this would mean it was sent to my home address and the one i had asked for would be ignored .
neutral	i picked this up but on sat when no - one was there to stop the delivery .
neutral	when i rang on monday the chaps said the paypal thing was a bit of an issue which needed to be ironed_out and he would recall the laptop , refund me and ring me when it turned_up to see waht i wanted to do .
neutral	£ days_later no call .
neutral	i rang again and got a lady_who said the paypal issue was in your ts_&_cs and i should have realised .
neutral	i said it was astupid place to put it and it needed an upfront warning or even refuse to allow paypal payment if you wanted a non - home address .
neutral	the laptop hadn_'_t come_back yet so she said i should wait .
neutral	ok but no need for the hassle .
neutral	i got a refund a couple of days_later , but no phone_call .
neutral	i reordered the laptop online , paying by visa .
neutral	next_day i get a text ; problem with the order , please ring .
neutral	i ring .
neutral	same lady .
neutral	why did i want to send to non - home address .
neutral	i explained i was buying the laptop for my sister who_lives in belfast .
neutral	i live in london .
neutral	she said they didn_'_t usually deliver to a foreign address .
neutral	i said belfast is not foreign .
neutral	she said it was over the water !
neutral	i said there was nothing about this on the site and i had paid the non - mainland postage .
neutral	she said it was in the ts_&_cs .
neutral	i had read them by this time .
neutral	like the paypal thing it isn_'_t .
neutral	she reluctantly said she would release the laptop .
neutral	next_day i get a text saying delivery refused by addressee .
neutral	i discover from dpd that this is because i have put my own postcode in not the belfast postcode ( stupid mistake on my part ).
neutral	i ring again .
neutral	same lady .
neutral	you put in the wrong_postcode so laptop in woodford , she says .
neutral	could it be changed i said , expecting a fight .
neutral	yes , she syas and does it .
neutral	phew .
neutral	laptop turns_up next_day in belfast .
neutral	amazingly quick .
neutral	next thing i discover i have been charged_twice on my visa bill .
neutral	i ring .
neutral	chap said he would have to look into it and would ring back .
neutral	no call back .
neutral	left it a few_days .
neutral	rnag again .
neutral	told repayment had been authorised on 00 / 0 .
neutral	left it a few more days .
neutral	repayment eventually turned_up on 0 / 0 .
neutral	good points ;: excellent price , good text comms about delivery , you do the right things eventually .
neutral	bad points ( which could be fixed ) - no - one ever rings back and over - defensiveness when things go_wrong .
neutral	need tp refuse paypal for alternative address .
neutral	a little disappointing if i '_m honest , i ordered 0 items and rec ' d an email a couple of days_later to say that one of the items was out of stock and that they were expecting further stock in 0 - 0 days .
neutral	i emailed back immediately saying don_'_t worry just cancel that item off the order and send the other two items ( one of which was charcoal i needed for the weekend ) , no response so i emailed again 0 days_later , still nothing .
neutral	i then get an email_saying that my order was going to be shipped ( a good week_later ) but although the initial item that was out of stock was now available one of my other items was now out !
neutral	anyway two_weeks after ordering 0 items arrived although i didn_'_t need them as i had to go get the items from elsewhere .
neutral	poor experience and not sure i would use again based on that .
neutral	0_stars is being generous !
neutral	sent 0 se x00 phones , both in perfect_condition in same package .
neutral	upon_receipt by envirophone i wa informed that one of them had a cracked back , reducing the offer price by 00 %!!
neutral	!
neutral	i asked for photo_evidence of the damage and was told they cannot do that .... l .
neutral	whilst acceptingbthat damage can occur , to lose £_00 in value over a plastic back costing a couple of piunds smacks of greed .
neutral	i shall not be using this service again as i am required to assume fault with a phone without being given evidence to confirm such a matter actually exists .
neutral	shockngly poor service .
neutral	ordered salomon ski_boots which were out of stock , quoted 0 days !
neutral	needed them urgently for a ski_trip , so paid air freight delivery !
neutral	they arrived by parcel / land route 0 days after i returned from holiday .
neutral	no one will talk or communicate with me to obtain money back for the difference in delivery costs , which is approx_£_00 . 00
neutral	no confidence that if a product had to be returned , whether you ' d get a replacement or money back !
neutral	hi all ,
neutral	i customised my cyberpower pc from the " ultra amd silent edition 0 core " increasing the memory to 00gb 0000mhz and twin raid 0 ssd .
neutral	£ 0000 seemed fair and comparable to other specs seen from pc_specialist etc so i was quite pleased with what i ordered .
neutral	the pc arrived approximately 0_weeks after_placing the order .
neutral	i felt the packaging could of been better as it was a box within a larger box and there wasn_'_t much packaging protecting the main pc .
neutral	however there were foam packs inside the case to keep all the components in place .
neutral	the assembled pc was pretty neat and tidy inside and out , so no_complaints there .
neutral	over the 0 days i '_ve had it running , it has crashed twice .
neutral	the second time it asked for a system restore and i lost all the software i installed on day 0 ( norton_000 & iolo system mechanic , vlc player ) plus a load of downloaded tv .
neutral	i '_ve reinstalled minimal software monday_night and system mechanic didn_'_t reveal any_issues , so here '_s hoping ?
neutral	i '_ve yet to contact customer service or tech_support as hopefully i '_ve resolved these issues now .
neutral	so_far my contact with them regarding ordering , delivery and system specification have been positive and so no criticisms there .
neutral	the system is quick , although windows 0 . 0 is a nightmare to use and i '_m pretty fluent in most windows os .
neutral	i '_m still trying to find the system event viewer to find out why the pc crashed .
neutral	i '_m not sure if i can add to this review in the long_term .
neutral	the flowers were of a good standard but the box they came in was half open .
neutral	complained to driver who claimed the damage was done before they took possession of the flowers .
neutral	the company in question are not very popular around this area for similar reasons .
neutral	only advice i would give to serenata ... rethink the delivery company .
neutral	the food so_far has_been really nice , only_downside was that one of the packs of sausages was open on arrival .
neutral	builders recommended bbe ( not good - conflict of interests ) i seemed to be kept out of the purchasing loop , to the point where the sales office on the development were updating me opposed to bbe .
neutral	some small issues after completion , bbe weren_'_t interested , they had their money and won_'_t like to upset the developer possible loss of new clients no doubt .
neutral	if buying a house i suggest going with a totally independent solicitor
neutral	to start with i had heard a number of reviews before purchase which brought me to the site .
neutral	during the ordering_process i was given the chance to receive a free welcome_pack , continuing on the payment it was made clear that i wasn_'_t able to enter any discount_codes unless i was registered as a user .
neutral	so i signed_up in the hope i would be able to use a code the website however when i signed onto the site i was no_longer able to receive my welcoming pack :( on to the delivery it was good however the mini shaker i had order was dirty and required a wash before use .
neutral	product tastes good and cheap which is something i ' d about this service .
neutral	feedback is welcome to my email on my account .
neutral	lanzarote .
neutral	the collection was easy enough at the airport but i wasn_'_t informed that i needed to depress the clutch to start the car so i was a little upset to start with .
neutral	also i was not told where to return the car to after the holiday .
neutral	i wrongly_assumed it would the be the same place as previous ... in the main car_park .
neutral	but no ....
neutral	i then had to rush around to get some change to find where to pay for the parking to moving the car to another car_park which made me late booking in for my flight .
neutral	there were no car manual / instructions in the car so i couldn_'_t look up any_problems i had .
neutral	the air_conditioning needed topping_up .
neutral	basically a little more care and thought would not go_amiss .
neutral	all the reservations around the world worked very well .
neutral	of course some airlines are far better_than others .
neutral	quite astonishing differences .
neutral	although this may not be within the remit , it is information that would have been relevant if a choice of airline was available .
neutral	the service that we required was for flying , without the requirement for hotels etc_., we chose to fly emirates for the start of our journey around the world and their service was superb .
neutral	as we opted for business class .
neutral	the outstanding comfort of the airplane an the superb service from the staff made the qantas flights seem positively barbaric .
neutral	the limousine service as part of the ticket was the icing_on the cake .
neutral	the ba flight was somewhat better_than qantas but some miles from emirates .
neutral	in fact the 0 hour flight we had on malaysian airlines in economy was a match for the qantas business seats .
neutral	the biggest irritation on the journey was that we were not able to check in on line for any but emirates and qantas .
neutral	this forced us to get to airports earlier_than necessary - just in case something was wrong .
neutral	we only discerned the pattern in the last flight check in while chatting with airline staff .
neutral	i ordered a camera , lens and a tripod head , i also wrote and asked that before they go_ahead with the payment , to get me a quote for more kit .
neutral	results : after three calls to their online department , the results was that they completely_ignored my request , and sent by next_day courier a camera ( without lens ) and tripod head .
neutral	i had asked 0 times that everything was to go on the same bill , but to no effect .
neutral	i '_ve since had emails saying that some of the items i asked to be quoted on ' have now arrived ' (?!)
neutral	i '_m also seeing that they are far over anyone_else '_s prices .
neutral	tempted to send everything back for being such a pain ….
neutral	if i behaved like this with my clients i ' d be out of a job .
neutral	great range of spares took over 00 days to for 0nd_class delivery suspect item was not dispatched when email claimed .
neutral	i booked for some simple repairs to my bathroom .
neutral	the procedure was quick and easy and i was informed via_sms of the arrangements and phone personally when to expect the engineer .
neutral	on the day the engineer arrived promptly and was well - presented .
neutral	the standard of works seems to be good as no issues after 0 days .
neutral	i would say that despite all their attention to detail for a simple service they are quite expensive as i ended_up paying over £_000 for replacement of 0 tiles and some re - sealing of a shower_door .
neutral	the deal that was offered represented good value .
neutral	the food arrived in a timely_manner but i wanted to change my order before it had been dispatched and this was not possible .
neutral	item was marked as dispatched last monday via cash_generator confirmation_email but then actually only dispatched this tuesday as notified by paypal .
neutral	i ordered a product and paid for next_day delivery .
neutral	there was an issue with the supplier , and it took at_least 0_weeks for my items to be received .
neutral	with no refund for next_day delivery !
neutral	i had to contact them to chase up my order a number of times , the guy i dealt_with was very helpful but an issue with a supplier shouldn_'_t have been at my expense .
neutral	the night before collection , we used online facility to extend the rental_period and request a collection earlier in the day .
neutral	on arrival at the collection office at the new time , we found the office was not aware of the online changes .
neutral	why can '_t online booking revisions be relayed to collection points in less_than 00_hours ?
neutral	also , the gps system was useless .
neutral	the software was far too slow for inner city travel .
neutral	we had driven past the turnings before the gps caught up .
neutral	and the gps was unable to find one address .
neutral	you provide decent cars , why do you offer bottom - of - the - range satnavs ?
neutral	despite these administration disappointments , the service from the office staff was excellent .
neutral	the front office is doing it '_s job , the back office must shape up !
neutral	this product is described as dewalt de0000 charger 0 . 0v - 00 . 0v 0 . 0ah and 0ah nicd batteries .
neutral	beware there are no nicad batteries included in the sale .
neutral	this just means that the charger will charge 0 . 0 and 0ah_batteries .
neutral	charger is cheaper_elsewhere on the net .
neutral	however the charger arrived quickly and is the genuine_article .
neutral	i have ordered several items , and been quite satisfied .
neutral	but on the last 0 occasions i have got the wrong_size , so i have given up trying .
neutral	all fine , but considering the money we spent , ' would rather have a discount than a free mirror we do not really need .
neutral	any suggestion in this respect fell on deaf_ears , not really what we expect in this competitive day and age .
neutral	no_problems purchasing the products .
neutral	when it arrived i thought it had been damaged .
neutral	turned_out the box used was too small and the product was put in ( in its own box ) without anything to protect it ( bubble_wrap etc_.)
neutral	found blinds0go while looking for a replacement blind for our kitchen .
neutral	very good website , smooth_transaction , excellent price and delivery was quick .
neutral	once blind arrived , it fit the window perfectly , which was great .
neutral	unfortunately , the main disappointment was the fixings for the blind .
neutral	they were made of very soft steel , and didn_'_t fit the blind properly .
neutral	i had to modify the blind housing to get the fixings to close , and while applying pressure to the fixings , they bent very easily .
neutral	repairs were required to get the blind up in the end .
neutral	overall .
neutral	the fixings let_me down somewhat .
neutral	i ' d be happy to have paid a few more pounds to get better quality fixings .
neutral	clearly great craftsmanship in the production of the blind , the company shouldn_'_t be supplying cheap fittings to go with it .
neutral	this merchant is fine if you can work out the part number from the manual and order it online .
neutral	support is useless as they never answer the phone or respond to email , though this is normal for r / c model shops , none of which seem to care to support the complex and fallible products they sell .
neutral	beware also a noticeable snobbishness in favour of petrol and against electric models !
neutral	the price was pretty decent and the staff friendly .
neutral	but after receiving a very good quote i was told the hotel wouldn_'_t honour the price offered and i would have to pay more .
neutral	this was quite a shame !
neutral	i still ended_up booking , with no added perks to compensate for the mis_- quote , which was a bit_annoying .
neutral	in future it may be worth getting deals with the hotels where only live prices are offered so that customers can be quoted the price they will pay .
neutral	the loading process was a shambles , those of us traveling on motorcycles were treated_like second class citizens . we were directed into a tiny area with barely enough room to dismount from our motorcycles and not enough room to open our_luggage cases . we were made to park our bikes so close together there was no room to move between them . we were left to secure our own bikes with filthy ratchet_straps with no help or guidance from the deck crew . some riders were on their first ferry trip and were at a complete loss as how to secure their bikes , this could have led to a serious situation . i was disgusted with out treatment i had a meeting with the first officer on the bridge to explain the situation in detail on the motorcycle problem .
neutral	the music in the lounge was great and really_cheered us up , the food in the 0 seas buffet although very very expensive was very good . the prices in other areas seemed very expensive also , 00_euros for a pizza sounds_like a mistake but that was the price !
neutral	!
neutral	the cabin was cool clean and comfortable but no soap_dispenser in the shower only at the sink made showering difficult , the cabins could do with some better quality pillows .
neutral	breakfast again was excellent but just far too expensive , why not have an continental buffet instead at a lower price , the cooked buffet was too much after the evening buffet .
neutral	apart_from the ridiculous area allocated the passengers traveling on motorcycles and the shambles during loading , the high food and drink prices and the expensive fares it was a fair trip .
neutral	+ ve
neutral	- happy with the quality of the product
neutral	- phone_call to agree a delivery date once unit was ready
neutral	- 0 man delivery team who waited whilst i checked the unit over

neutral	- t &_cs around returns are over bearing & were nearly enough to put me off ordering from them .
neutral	- did not get promised text_confirming delivery
neutral	- did not get told that deliveries start at 0am on saturdays and we were first drop of the day !
neutral	:-(
neutral	- pricing policy is a joke .
neutral	they run a separate site with sky high prices to enable them to quote massive_discounts on the main site .
neutral	does anyone really fall for it ?
neutral	would be happy to order from someone_who claimed " we sell competitively products that are made in a country with low labour_costs but subject to our design and build stds "
neutral	i bought 0 brixton hats one ` gain ` dress hats ( charcoal ) and one mens black ` station iii ` snapback cap the second arrive in proper way the first came with the feather on reverse side and it left as quick as i touch the cap , inside the fabric was damage .
neutral	i dont want to send the product back but next time i will buy brixton caps at hatsandcaps . co . uk because they never_let_me down .
neutral	best regards .
neutral	what a gig !
neutral	two great bands backed by a full orchestra , played out on a grand stage .
neutral	an epic event that completely blew me away surpassing all expectation .
neutral	get me in got me in but i had to pay a wee_bit extra to secure the tickets , then had to pay additional fees on top .
neutral	website great to get around , great prices but service from local_dealer let the whole_experience down .
neutral	whilst overal we were extremely satisfied with the rental i was dissapointed with the cost of ' a full_tank of fuel ' which worked out at € 0 . 00 per_litre , as_opposed to a forecourt price around € 0 . 00 !
neutral	i would much rather have taken the vehicle full and returned the car full of fuel ( as most uk car_rentals operate ) having sourced my own replacement fuel at the lower costs .
neutral	there is also pressure to purchase ' additional_insurance covers ' for things such as windscreen , tyres and undercarriage .
neutral	these are clearly ways for the hire company to ' add value ' to their own profits .
neutral	the likelihood of damaging these is remote and you can take the risk and not purcahse the cover although i would recommend shopping around on - line in advance to cover such eventualities ( we purchased cover for £_00 as_opposed to the € 00 euro '_s requested at the airport ).
neutral	item arrived exactly as_described in very quick time .
neutral	the on - line tracking service wasn_'_t very good as it didn_'_t tell me the item was dispatched but it did arrive as planned .
neutral	i brought a blackberry for £_000 and a year later it '_s terriblely great price of £_00 . 00 but the postage was super quick but i did not receive the check very quickly so that is it they made me wait !
neutral	and a iwant a iphone get it lol .
neutral	the service was efficient and quick .
neutral	my ( husband '_s ) 0 photos were subtle in tone and colour but with a fresh ( winter ) sparkle to them - this was lost in the cards and the colours appeared dulled and in one case ' greyed '.
neutral	just usable but disappointing .
neutral	i chose small cards and would have preferred the ' cardtown ' logo to be appropriately smaller , less obtrusive and also to be left off the envelope .
neutral	i know the card source needs to be shown , but i wasn_'_t paying for showy advertising .
neutral	probably_won_'_t use cardtown again
neutral	so fare so good was accepted on 00 / 00 /_0000 not had my first payment go out yet but if they say i will be deat free in 0 years by paying £_000 a month for £ 00000 that '_s got to be good .
neutral	so we see how it goes :) my iva was quick and simple to sort_out with the help they gave_me about 0_weeks it took
neutral	highly_recommend the website for fast and efficient service .
neutral	great range of products .
neutral	slrhut offered the best price on a canon xa00 , and i am pleased with their delivery and the product , but i experienced something i have never had before - a phone_call shortly_after_placing my online order to upsell other accessories , pay for more speedy delivery etc .
neutral	full - strength us selling ( which is where the goods were sent from btw ) which was hard to close down .
neutral	makes me think that the headline prices for the cameras etc are not profitable and they have to make it up with unbranded additional items ( in my case a us battery_charger with no uk adapter supplied - now being corrected ).
neutral	their email comms can be a bit_slow .
neutral	was ok but still not heard back from my claim
neutral	products arrived quickly , good line of products , sizing was questionable on the item i bought but that is due to manufacturer however a note on the site to say sizes can be small would have helped
neutral	information and advice on sizing prior to ordering was extremely_helpful , the member of staff concerned being both polite and courteous .
neutral	after some difficulty with the website , due entirely to my own circumstances , i placed my order by ' phone , the lady concerned again being both very friendly and helpful .
neutral	as work_commitments meant that i would not be available to take delivery personally it was arranged for the parcel to be delivered to my parents ' address .
neutral	the delivery driver turned_up during the scheduled time period , but was so impatient that he did not give my mother sufficient time to answer the door_bell before turning on his heels and returning to his_van , having already signed off the item as ' non - delivered '.
neutral	when my mother did answer the door the driver was , in her opinion , extremely disgruntled at having been called back and was discourteous in his_attitude_towards her .
neutral	she is 00 .
neutral	whilst i appreciate that the fault lies with the courier company , rather_than directly with my tuxedo , their attitude and poor levels of service does leave a negative impression on the whole buying experience .
neutral	ordered shed for my daughter , with her address for delivery , and my address for cardholder .
neutral	driver then tried to deliver the shed to my address and after showing him my receipt with the delivery address clearly_shown , he delivered it to my daughter ( luckily only 00 miles_away ).
neutral	about four days_later i had a call from the delivery company saying that my shed was ready for delivery .
neutral	they had been given my name and address round the wrong way , they asked for mr findon of peacock road instead of mr peacock of findon road .
neutral	i told them i already had my shed and they asked if i had ordered two - one with windows and one without windows .
neutral	i said i ' d ordered only one ( without windows ).
neutral	anyway , i ended_up with the right parts to build a windowless shed with a load of superfluous perspex windows .
neutral	the shed is very good though .
neutral	firstly i must stress i use myhermes fairly infrequently , i have sent about 00 parcels with them now and so_far only one problem .
neutral	they left the parcel in ' a safe_place '...... which turned_out to be a bin on bin day ........ you can guess the rest :( when i spoke to the customer they were annoyed as this was the 0nd time the myhermes driver had done this despite_being specifically_asked not to .
neutral	still_waiting for the compensation though !
neutral	on the plus_side though all other parcels delivered fine , the website is good and the service has_been reliable .
neutral	i think the main problem is that i have read all the reviews and just cant trust them with more of my orders .
neutral	any modern day php developer knows that many of your applications files do not belong in the publicly accessible part of your website .
neutral	modern frameworks usually contain several folders such as application , library etc which should not be available to visitors .
neutral	000 - reg ftp only allows you to load everything into the public_html folder .
neutral	this , without having to explain myself ) causes problems .
neutral	however it is easily fixed by setting the apache documentroot to a subfolder such as public_html / public .
neutral	however , again this is another basic function which is lacking in their hosting services .
neutral	i was told none of this was possible and to start changing my code .
neutral	a quick chat with some fellow developers over irc and the general consensus is that they wouldnt touch 000 - reg with a barge_pole , for these reasons .
neutral	however , my client had already bought and paid for their hosting so i kept at the support staff and they manually changed the settings for me , pointing_out to me that they were making an exception for me .
neutral	so the site is now serving up as it should !
neutral	i have nothing but praise for the support guy_who helped_me , victor .
neutral	he deserves a medal , raise , promotion , or all 0 !
neutral	i also asked that he pass my support_ticket on to management .
neutral	in my eyes , lacking these basic functions is a serious flaw with their hosting , and no doubt puts off many developers from investing in what is a rather good platform otherwise !
neutral	overall , i am happy with the end_result , and hope that 000 - reg value customer feedback and will hopefully implement these basic features in the near_future :-)
neutral	three bookings , only one mishap , the site allowed_us to book into a fully booked hostel .
neutral	the hostel became double - booked but they thankfully accommodated everyone on spite of this .
neutral	we use the shuttle a lot on our visits to mallorca , mainly_because it is decent value when compared to the cost of a return taxi .
neutral	however there are downsides that you need to be aware of .
neutral	firstly , there can be very long q '_s at the check - in desk , the last thing you need after a long flight , the tedium of going through passport_control , and your bags coming off the carousel last .
neutral	there has to be a better way in this day and age .
neutral	secondly , there will be an almost inevitable wait of up to 00_minutes ( well that '_s what the say on the website ).
neutral	the bus will wait_until they have crammed on as many people from as many flights as they can .
neutral	unfortunately you do this without the engine running and hence no air - con .
neutral	with outside temperatures between 00 and 00 in june , july and august you can_imagine what it '_s like inside the bus !
neutral	finally , they have a smartphone_app which is pretty good .
neutral	you can check your return pick - up time but you still have to make a phone_call to confirm your return_journey .
neutral	surely this could be done from the app ?
neutral	got into the car - park no problem and found a space immediately .
neutral	on our return we thought that the signs for the car - park were really poor .
neutral	if we hadn_'_t have remembered the route we took on arrival we might still be there now !
neutral	the car itself was fine .
neutral	had to wait about two hours in the cue to collect the car at saltzburg airport .
neutral	i was charged an " airport fee " in addition to the initial fee paid online plus an " out of hours fee " despite it being a saturday_afternoon at a ski destination .
neutral	auto_europe used to be the only place i would look for a hire car , i would definitely try to get a car elsewhere next time .
neutral	the customer service was excellent .
neutral	however you need to be careful because enterprise actually did not reserve the deposit on my card , but actually charged 000_euro on my card .
neutral	my credit_card company had to charge me £ 0 . 00 .
neutral	i have been renting car and this is the first time it has happened to me .
neutral	i will be speaking to rent a car for a refund because that was not part of the deal .
neutral	i will see how they will react after my review .
neutral	overall services was fantastic .
neutral	delighted with my sideboard once it arrived .
neutral	had ordered another item from a different supplier which arrived in three_days to edinburgh .
neutral	this piece took considerably longer to get here and had to call distributor several_times before anyone answered to give me a delivery date .
neutral	delivery driver very pleasant .
neutral	i just bought the speg winter_gloves .
neutral	they arrived almost before i ' d completed the order .
neutral	they look good , but they are short , and have a ' v ' cut into them , both of which really limit their waterproof and windproof claims .
neutral	i guess you get what you pay for .
neutral	the item was a good price , marked as a ' sale ' item at the time .
neutral	postage_costs seemed ok .
neutral	however it was only after engaging with the actual payment process that an additional_charge for ' packing ' appeared on the payment invoice .
neutral	by this time i could not be_bothered to cancel the process and buy the item from other source that would have saved me a couple of pounds , and continued with the postage .
neutral	i notice however that i am left with a negative feeling towards tooled_- up .
neutral	tyres and price ok garage used one stop not so good .
neutral	tyres_fitted on friday and having to take back next week to have balancing redone , also had to go back as fitter left my centre cap of , these are about 00 quid and it was lucky i checked before i left the garage as i have been caught like this before
neutral	very quick supply and arrived exactly as stated .
neutral	rubbish chipboard_shelves and thin tabs on shelf design .
neutral	took 0 hour to assemble each unit .
neutral	will pass judgement when we see how long they last .
neutral	i would like the option to print a ticket , rather_than showing my bank card on the door .
neutral	this way if i am unable to make it to the event and want to give my ticket to a friend , i can simply give my friend the ticket print - out , rather_than having to give them my bank card .
neutral	found that the quality of the product excellent , but i '_m afraid the way the dispatch and delivery were completed let them down .
neutral	i requested , at the time of ordering that i would require either a track number or at the very least an email to state the product had been dispatched with detail of what day it could be expected , i asked them to contact me before they manufactured the product in order that i could arrange for delivery to another address if they could not supply the information / email etc .
neutral	this was very important as the company stated they would require someone to sign for the parcel .
neutral	they did non of the above , resulting in the parcel being left with a neighbour who forgot to tell anyone_else in the house , therefore it couldn_'_t be found when we went to collect it ----------- you couldn_'_t write a better scrip on how to irritate !!!!
neutral	!
neutral	contact from them would have eliminated all of this
neutral	i purchased two flights and was charged in gbp .
neutral	credit_card bill comes and is £ 0 more_expensive involving time_consuming calls to credit_card company .
neutral	i ordered on thursday_afternoon ( before 0pm ) and even_though my order came up to j00 and i paid extra for the next_day delivery as i was going on holiday sat eve .
neutral	my neighbour told me the parcel arrived on monday - three_days , that is probably what normal free delivery would take ( and did take - with the previous_orders ).
neutral	a bit disappointed with the " speedy " delivery .
neutral	i couldn_'_t fault the car or the ease of hiring on line .
neutral	however , i get annoyed when i am not asked if i want the additional_insurance for tyres and glass .
neutral	you do not have to have it and this time it cost me more than the hire itself .
neutral	they added it to the credit_card when adding the tank of fuel .
neutral	when you are tired and hungry and been waiting in a queue for a while you just want to get the car and go .
neutral	it was not mentioned to me just added .
neutral	just waiting to see if i get my half a tank of fuel back .
neutral	i didn_'_t get it all last time !
neutral	i was very happy with my costumes timely arrival .
neutral	though my costume didn_'_t come complete and that put the panic in things .
neutral	returned costumes clearly need to be checked first .
neutral	also , more accurate photos would be good as sometimes photos are very flatterring .
neutral	some quality control especially on things like armour need to be better .
neutral	but over all , best selection around and i got all my stuff in time so over all happy .
neutral	have to wait and see !
neutral	what a shame this company feel the need to spoil an excellent online ordering and delivery service with ham - fisted arrogant and insulting attempts to sell you their extra_insurance_cover .
neutral	the phone_calls i received regarding my item varied from after 0 mins asking for my sort code and claiming i had agreed to taking out their insurance ..... i hadn_'_t !
neutral	another customer service advisor (!)
neutral	didn_'_t even know if my item had been delivered although this was beaten by the one who phoned and try to sell me their insurance before the item had even arrived ...' for peace of mind during_transit '!!!!!!
neutral	!
neutral	items are great and delivery so quick but leave me alone !
neutral	body_warmer was quite a good design i liked the arm and waist elastic , but .
neutral	the size ws too small and the fabric caught in the zip every time which would have driven me to distraction , so i returned it .
neutral	camp trousers were too high waisted , but better_than scruffs from wicked as they are in the right place .
neutral	knee_pads were excellent , flexible and well_designed would buy again .
neutral	best part was being_able to return the clothes via collect_plus , very convenient as i have a collection_point close by .
neutral	this overcomes the objection of buying clothes over the internet , but your brand_name is being compromised by selling sub dickies clothes bought in for sales .
neutral	i haven_'_t received my latest order ( as of now sunday 00 . 0 . 00 ).
neutral	previously it has arrived almost the next_day so this is i suspect ( and hope ) a temporary glitch .
neutral	a good thing to judge a company by is how they respond to glitches so i await with interest .
neutral	best_wishes
neutral	peter
neutral	order now turned_up ( monday_morning )!
neutral	thanks .
neutral	i had bought the 00 luxury red_roses for my girlfriend on valentines_day , but when they arrived luxury is not one off the many words i would use describe them
neutral	the roses had holes in the petals and they were dry and withered ,
neutral	after some emails and they had viewed the photos i sent to serenata they sent another 00 luxury roses the following_day that were off far better quality and the girlfriend was very happy .
neutral	was let_down if im totally honest as it was my first valentines with my girlfriend and we all know it only comes once a year but atleast serenata actioned this poor situation
neutral	the service was efficient , and it was good to build your own sign , but a wider_choice of fonts would be good , and backgrounds .
neutral	also , there was no option to have holes_drilled in them - as they are designed as external signs they need to be mounted on a wall or post , so they would need screw_holes .
neutral	ordering was easy and it arrived quickly but they didn_'_t send any " dispatched " emails to let_me know my trainers were on their way .
neutral	i emailed querying delivery date and didn_'_t hear back but luckily the trainers arrived the next_day .
neutral	brilliant website and fast delivery but lack of communication took the gloss of a bit .
neutral	the messaging on the outer_boxes is great by the way !
neutral	package was collected ok , but waited in all day , only for the package to arrive just before 0pm !
neutral	tracker was rubbish as it only said that the parcel was in transit .
neutral	interesting that i then received an email_saying it had been delivered at 00 . 00 - yeah_right !
neutral	!
neutral	good price , items survived but the packaging was next to non - existent .
neutral	on £_000 worth of clamps i would expect more than bits of cardboard on the heads and nothing but cling - wrap on the bars .
neutral	they were bent by being taped_together too .
neutral	when the website says " box of 0 clamps " i would hope that '_s what i ' d get , not 0 pairs just taped_together and wrapped in plastic .
neutral	comms were good , and delivery was as per specified time .
neutral	however the delivery driver thought it was acceptable to hammer on the door and ring the doorbell repeatedly until someone answered , because it was raining a bit outside , thus waking the baby who had just been tucked in for a sleep .
neutral	service is good , but port facilities poor ( particularly at dunkirk ).
neutral	onboard catering is not much_better .
neutral	given the extra duration of the crossing , the experience is bearable , but not a positive part of the holiday .
neutral	the selection of goods in the shop is also limited .
neutral	may revert to p_& o dover - calais next time , and put up with the extra miles on the french side .
neutral	i was happy with the range of products available , but the item i wanted wasn_'_t available straight_away but i only found this out after i was contacted by phone .
neutral	i was told it would be about two_weeks .
neutral	i then got an email about three_weeks_later telling_me my item had been shipped .
neutral	these_guys could be so much_better , they need to sort_out their customer_services however it is becoming a joke .
neutral	just hope you speak to someone in the uk , i have heard really bad conversations with some extremely rude people .
neutral	broadband as everyone_knows is rapid , yes you never get the full speed quoted but it is more than most will ever need , soon to be increased too .
neutral	good website but i can not yet comment on the service as i have yet to have my tyres_fitted .
neutral	i found the online order system fiddly and have ended_up with my picture portrait but the calendar has_been produced landscape so i '_m not impressed
neutral	i ordered some cans of soda ... one of them was broken , possibly due to poor wrapping ... not a big deal , but if you order 00 cans you expect to receive 00 cans , not 00 .
neutral	in any case the experience was positive overall .
neutral	i missed that soda very much , i '_m quite addicted .
neutral	: d
neutral	ok website but can be difficult to find information at times .
neutral	being_able to pay things online is a good idea but there are really annoying survey popups !
neutral	product arrived well_packaged and as_described .
neutral	i have shopped with animed_direct previously , on both_occasions the product i ordered arrived .
neutral	unfortunately on both_occasions i have had to call and chase up my order .
neutral	tme to delivery is approx 00 days .
neutral	they should specify this when ordering .
neutral	apart_from delivery delay , product has_been as expected and customer service has_been polite .
neutral	first its down , oddbins is apparently bankrupt , then its up , whittalls wine merchants buy half the stores and save thousands of job .
neutral	looked on the internet today and the website was down , probably just a blip .
neutral	i dont_think oddbins can compete against much_cheaper supermarket wines .
neutral	they are trying to offer a top_notch product to a skint britain .
neutral	aldi may be very downmarket , but they are also very cheap .
neutral	i dont_think they do home delivery .
neutral	so unless you have an aldi locally you will miss out on their bargains .
neutral	compared with other supermarket_chains i would describe aldis website as boring and laclustre .
neutral	so if you want bargains go to an aldi store because the website is a waste of time .
neutral	the sun .
neutral	its not everyones favourite newspaper .
neutral	mine neither .
neutral	it trys to be too sensational rather_than provide news it looks for scandal .
neutral	i dont really care which celebrity is sleeping with another celebrity or which celebrity has a new haircut or who looks great in their new dress .
neutral	this newspaper will never change .
neutral	it may be popular .
neutral	it may be great for everyone_else , but its not my cup of tea .
neutral	i was happy when i completed my booking but as i printed out my confirmation there was a cost of £ 0 transfer each way that i was not made aware of when booking .
neutral	even if it is not a cost of yours and payable to you i feel all costs should be identified on the booking .
neutral	i paid for 0 - 0 day guaranteed delivery .
neutral	took four days to come .
neutral	not the first time it '_s happened .
neutral	however the product prices are very good .
neutral	the internet ordering_process was easy enough .
neutral	i ordered and paid for 0 tyres for my brother to be installed at garage in necastle .
neutral	when he turned_up the ordered tyres were not available .
neutral	fortunately he had printed out the order and the garage decided to full fill it with other tyres ( slightly more_expensive ) but at_least he left with new tyres on his car .
neutral	if i were to do this again i ' d ensure i called and advised the garage of the order and again call them on the day to ensure availability when i arrived .
neutral	garage service 0 *, ease of internet ordering 0 * but backend processing to fulfill order failed .
neutral	end has a wide rage of great clothing and i shop_here all them time .
neutral	although i felt they were slightly short tempered with me when i was asking for information on why a transaction wasn_'_t completed .
neutral	they didn_'_t resolve the matter but communication was good
neutral	flowers were great , but the box they were delivered in was all bashed and soaking_wet
neutral	my experience of the protein_works on the whole has_been positive .
neutral	the products are good and the service and delivery great .
neutral	however , having given across my email details as part of the order i am now inundated daily with their latest offers .
neutral	daily contact much too much !
neutral	tarnishing my experience .
neutral	i received an email request to write this feedback with trustpilot before getting the goods .
neutral	in the email i noticed that nigel havens wanted to thank me " personally for my valued business ".
neutral	i also noticed that the email was " sent automatically , therefore it is possible you have received this before your package or service ".
neutral	so not that personal then .
neutral	the delivery company , city - link messed_up their delivery because they " forgot to put the box on the van ".
neutral	city - link could not operate outside the box by making up for their mistake by just delivering it when i requested , as they needed havens authorization to deliver the package on saturday ( apparently that cost extra ).
neutral	havens gave a generic answer when i told them of city - links mess up .
neutral	probably cost me five times as much money to buy the goods online through havens as it would through a local shop .
neutral	it isn_’_t messing up the delivery that ’_s irritating , well just a bit .
neutral	it ’_s the total_lack of action to put things right by either party that make me want fart in their general direction .
neutral	when you ring this company there is nobody who you can speak to for advice there is no personal_touch
neutral	i ordered a pair of glasses yesterday and paid 00 quid for the frame including lenses , that '_s awesome given other retailer '_s prices start from 00 minimum .
neutral	but i still_haven_'_t received an acknowledgement email from them !
neutral	i was very surprised and happy about the fast delivery .
neutral	however the cartomisers i got were pretty awful .
neutral	so harsh and tasteless
neutral	service was good but the self post packaging was a bit on the flimsy side , could do with a more robust_packaging .
neutral	from a usability perspective our full width sofa_bed is great and it came at an unmatchable price .
neutral	once assembled , it is a full double_bed size when pulled_out and the sofa itself is wide enough to use as a single bed , so ideal for what we wanted - a put you up in our spare_room .
neutral	it is also a large comfortable sofa in its own right .
neutral	however .....
neutral	as clearly warned , it arrived on a pallet and really needs two people to safely take it off the pallet and transer it to the room where it is to be constructed .
neutral	it is essentially a 0d jigsaw_puzzle which has to be built piece by piece from good quality mdf ( heavy ), sponge and fabric ; the last items to be fitted are the arms ( which are pre_- constructed ) so it is not possible , as with most sofas , to lift it by the arms to move it .
neutral	in fact , it is nigh on impossible to move without it disassembling itself ; it is very heavy .
neutral	so , in summary , great value item for the spare_room , but i wouldn_'_t personally recommend it for your lounge .
neutral	we ordered a washing_machine and tumble_dryer in the same model and colour ( graphite grey ) to be delivered on the same day .
neutral	when they arrived they were the same model but the dryer was white !
neutral	you would think anyone picking the order / delivering would perhaps just check they ' d got it correct when matching models with different_colours were going to the same address .
neutral	the dryer was replaced quickly but not on the day that suited me best , i think when errors like this are made the company should have a fast track replacement service .
neutral	when the second delivery driver swapped them over he said that mistake had gone_through 0 people .
neutral	not good enough i '_m afraid .
neutral	positives_: the food .
neutral	it '_s really great .
neutral	negatives : items arrive looking battered , the gel_packs often split covering your goods .
neutral	protein arrived black with dirt , i cleaned it , turns_out the bag was white .
neutral	who knew .
neutral	no matter what you order it '_s all just bundled loosely into a big box .
neutral	explains the damage_caused then .
neutral	when you contact customer_support you rarely get any actual support or service .
neutral	it took many many emails and a conversation with a director before several issues were resolved with one of my experiences .
neutral	you get what you pay for .
neutral	this is a cheap and cheerful service .
neutral	0 times out of 00 it all works seamlessly and they systems are good but the 0 time things go_wrong can be a proper pain .
neutral	the most irritating thing is you can '_t call these_guys and instead you have to use web chat to someone_who_uses pre_- pepared answers and ha a " computer says no " attitude .
neutral	they will sympathise with you but can '_t / won_'_t do much to help .
neutral	so in summary , use them , know what you ' re getting but have a back up plan .
neutral	faro_airport was in chaos when we arrived with no signage for drive0less ( which we now know is part of guerin ). after a walking_tour of faro_airport and numerous false leads we finally picked_up the car .
neutral	the car and staff were good but the rental_agreement included a full_tank of petrol ( probably for a range_rover - it doesn_'_t take € 00 to fill a polo ) with the instruction to bring the car back as close to empty as possible - needless to say we hadn_'_t gone to portugal on a driving holiday and the car had half a tank when returned - a profit of € 00 for guerin .
neutral	ordered hat - wrong_colour sent , called and given apology and returned item for correct hat dispatch - then informed they didn_'_t have my ordered colour ?
neutral	full_refund given so 0_stars .
neutral	when i re - checked the website - it still showed my hat colour in my size in stock ?
neutral	if you are calling yourself e_- outdoors get your " e " sorted so people don_'_t waste lots of time and effort .
neutral	booked online to save 00 or 00 quid which was good .
neutral	barcode check in at tower_bridge worked well when we had identified the proper bus operators staff .
neutral	seemed a haggle of competitors touting for business .
neutral	big_bus seem to corner the market .
neutral	be interested to know how others compare as cover similar routes and others seem less busy .
neutral	lots of people on these tours but if you pick the right drop_off points lots of room up top .
neutral	annoyed to find this trip qualified for a free boat_trip which we ' d already done the day before .
neutral	entertaining guides with different_styles .
neutral	both likely to be repetitive or get on your nerves if you ' re doing the whole circuit in one go , but they did well overall .
neutral	one guide was an older londoner who engaged the passengers , other was younger and felt i was on a kids tv programme at times , but both humorous and knowledgable overall .
neutral	for some reason we had " an unavoidable detour " down oxford_street , aka a 00 minute traffic jam , and missed quite a few sights .
neutral	could have been a genuine reason for this but we didn_'_t see any other tourist buses in front or behind us , so not sure what that was about .
neutral	kids lost interest at this point !
neutral	so did i staring at selfridges window for 00_minutes !
neutral	for a product ( por00 fuel preservative & stabilizer ( us pint )) costing_£_00 . 00 to pay £ 0 . 00 postage will unfortunately make me think very carefully before buying again - sorry !
neutral	note : i used hatched nearly 0 years_ago , but they only just asked me for my opinion today (!)
neutral	let '_s be honest : selling houses isn_'_t difficult .
neutral	actually finding a buyer can take a while and need some luck , but it doesn_'_t require skill .
neutral	these days , with the internet and rightmove , all you really need from your estate_agent is a " ticket " to post some photos and a description on rightmove ( which you cannot ( could not ?)
neutral	do as a private_individual ).... so why not buy that ticket as cheaply as possible : you ' re going to end up doing all the work and chasing yourself anyway .
neutral	nearly 0 years_ago , i don_'_t think hatched had been going for long , but based on what i said above , i just needed somebody to post my details onto rightmove - which they did - eventually .
neutral	from then on it was a familiar story of poor communication , endless chasing , never returning calls , but was no worse than i expected .
neutral	at_least i wasn_'_t paying through the nose for a high_street agent to give the same level of service .
neutral	i found a buyer quite quickly - but that '_s the benefit of rightmove , not hatched .
neutral	the buyer wanted to move very quickly and that led to a lot of difficulties and hatched were useless at helping with this .
neutral	all in all , 0 years_ago , they weren_'_t very good , but they were no worse than i expected and a load cheaper_than a dinosaur high_street agent .
neutral	to conclude .... i bought my " ticket " onto rightmove through them .
neutral	that was all .
neutral	i then did the work .
neutral	it concluded successfully .
neutral	the order was for some spare bulbs for a bell push .
neutral	the product supplied was a manufacturer '_s original replacement , and the price charged was competitive with other_suppliers .
neutral	however , the delivery in 0 - 0 days slipped somewhat .
neutral	i received notification of a despatch date which was at the longest applicable under their terms .
neutral	i rang some 0 days_later to let them know the consignment had not been delivered .
neutral	i accept that they had a supply problem ( not stated at the time of ordering ), but surely some communication notifying the late despatch would have been helpful .
neutral	the run up to the stag_do was very good .
neutral	lots of communication with chillisauce , they facilitated the payments etc which saved me , the best man , a lot of hassle .
neutral	broadly speaking , the whole stag_do was a success with one exception .
neutral	we paid for guest_list entry on the friday_night and found that we weren_'_t on the list in some places which frustrated us and had an affect on the fun we were having that night .
neutral	we complained on the saturday and were told we ' d be added to a club guest_list for saturday_night .
neutral	again , on arriving at the club , we weren_'_t on the guest_list !!!
neutral	very frustrating and hence the poor review .
neutral	firstly i can confirm the company is genuine and trustworthy , so don_'_t have any concerns there .
neutral	the watch supplied was exactly as ordered with all necessary breitling international warranties .
neutral	its condition was perfect .
neutral	i was disappointed that my watch was delayed beyond the maximum stated delivery and i had to chase updates a couple of times .
neutral	i believe swiss_watches did what they could to chase the order though , delivery to the authorised_dealer appeared to be beyond their control .
neutral	my other disappointment was that the website states under the watch i ordered that the watch came with a 0 day refund policy , offering me peace of mind if i needed it .
neutral	when i placed my order i was told my watch was a special order though and therefore wasn_'_t eligible .
neutral	my watch wasn_'_t anything special , it was a standard breitling aerospace evo .
neutral	i think the website is misleading and told swiss_watches this but they state the full terms of the refund policy are available online .
neutral	it wouldn_'_t take them long to update the site so the watches that aren_'_t eligible are listed as such though , so read what you what into the way they present their refund policy .
neutral	the final price was better_than anywhere on the high_street but maybe not by the margins you ' d expect .
neutral	don_'_t write off your local official dealer before getting their best quote .
neutral	i was offered a quote within £_000 of the final price i paid swiss_watches , the watch was in stock and the fitting would have been free .
neutral	in short it was an acceptable experience and i ' d consider_using them again .
neutral	i get the impression most people have a better experience than i did from their reviews .
neutral	would be useful to know when delivery will arrive .
neutral	many carriers now give approx time slots .
neutral	please stop putting stickers on the 00 ".
neutral	some labels often make real effort to have good designs made and printed on good quality materials ( often reflected in a higher retail price ) and then you go ruin it by putting silly stickers on .
neutral	i used to use you very time when ordering items online .
neutral	no i use you as a last_resort when items sell out elsewhere .
neutral	boomkat , redeye , mirage0000 , phonica , juno , bleep all do not have the need to put stickers on , so you shouldnt either .
neutral	i '_m happy with the speed and price of the service i received , but after wearing the glasses for a couple of weeks now , i have noticed that one of the lenses has not been correctly fitted to the frame .
neutral	each time i clean my glasses , the lens pops in and out of position .
neutral	it feels_like only a matter of time before the lens will pop completely out .
neutral	i am now going to contact gd to follow - up on this issue .
neutral	i parked in short_stay car_park 0 .
neutral	the number_plate reader wouldn_'_t recognise my car on exit although it had on entry .
neutral	the instructions said to press the call button and speak to an expert operator in case of difficulty - which was fine_except there was no button marked for assistance .
neutral	eventually tried another exit lane , had same problems .
neutral	pressed all buttons at random and found one that gave a dial tone which an operator answered .
neutral	she took my details and let_me out .
neutral	apparently my number wasn_'_t readable because i ' d included spaces between numbers and letters when making the reservation ; but that doesn_'_t stack up as the plate was read without problem on entry and there was no guidance at the reservation stage that this was a critical issue .
neutral	also , the lack of an assistance button sign apparently was because the label must have fallen_off ... on both machines ?
neutral	overall a good , but pricey experience , marred_by the exit problems .
neutral	although the site was quick and easy to use i '_m left_wondering_whether i '_ve been done .
neutral	i am still not able to view , download or print the accomodation voucher link that you are sent to .
neutral	the site tells you there is an error or that its temporarily down .
neutral	emails sent regarding problem isn_'_t acknowledged either !!!
neutral	!
neutral	i have waited in all day for my parcel .
neutral	went down to the garage to find it in there .
neutral	no knock on the door and no note left through the door , so i waited in all day for nothing .
neutral	suggest dpd get more reliable drivers who are prepared to deliver to the door , or at_least advise that they have been .
neutral	following my review , after a phone_call from the driver , he insisted that they had knocked and received no answer .
neutral	he could not explain_why if that was the case , there was no note left through the door .
neutral	i am however increasing my rating on the assumption that he is not a liar .
neutral	i have upgraded my opinion of interparcel , because although their response to my non collection issues by hermes ( who should be avoided at all costs ), was slow and cost me my sale , eventually tried to rectify the situation .
neutral	interparcel need to be more careful about the couriers that they support , as ( was in the case with my customer ) the seller gets the blame .
neutral	hermes who were the culprit got away scott free ( or so they think ).
neutral	i do not think with the reviews that hermes are getting on trustpilot . com and also facebook that they will be around for much longer .
neutral	interparcel should drop hermes as soon as possible before it tarnishes their reputation !
neutral	it took a long time to get my order refunded
neutral	good service , friendly website
neutral	my order was late because due to an error it wasnt passed_onto their warehouse , that said once i reported the delay the matter was quickly rectified and i had my order within
neutral	00_hrs .
neutral	product arrived very quickly , but should have been packed much_better , since both the cans i ordered were badly deformed .
neutral	so much so , that i thought they might have leaked product ( it turned_out that in fact they did not ).
neutral	either the cans was deformed during_transit or were sent deformed .
neutral	ordered additional product from a different vendor .
neutral	it was sent by royal_mail and the can was perfect .
neutral	i was massively_impressed with the customer service offered through the excellent website .
neutral	i used the online_chat several_times and the team answered my questions fully every time .
neutral	a big tick !
neutral	unfortunately my experience was much less_than satisfactory once the orders had been made .
neutral	your website said that everything i ordered was in stock - i needed to know this because i had a very quick_turnaround on a bathroom_project .
neutral	i received a confirmation_email_confirming this .
neutral	it was only after i happened to phone up to ask for some details that i was told that the bath i ordered was not going to be available for some time - it was out of stock .
neutral	if i had not phoned - i would not have been informed .
neutral	annoying - i cancelled the bath ( ordered from elsewhere in the end ) but kept other elements of my order .
neutral	i was then later emailed to say that the shower_riser and tap was out of stock and would not be in for another week or so .
neutral	a pain , but ok as long as it arrived in the time i was told it would .
neutral	subsequently i have received and email to say it will now be much later than initially specified .
neutral	this is a real problem .
neutral	i have tilers etc all lined_up an waiting to go ( yes i know the recommendation is to not do it this way around but one has to sometimes ).
neutral	major groan i know but really it '_s about communication and also stock control .
neutral	don_'_t advertise something as being available if it is not - simple .
neutral	if you could sort these issues out you would have a brilliant service .
neutral	experience with rentalcars absolutely fine .
neutral	experience with sixt , not so .
neutral	overall , no_problems until drop_off .
neutral	the petrol needle was a hairs breadth below full - unless you are aware of the shell station , hidden away in belgravia ( sixt certainly don_'_t tell you ) then there is nowhere obvious to top up , if indeed it had been possible given how full the tank was .
neutral	that '_s when i was told that it wasn_'_t full ( it was a darn sight fuller than when i picked it up ) and that i would be charged for a % refill and at double the cost of the petrol , plus_vat .
neutral	not satisfying !
neutral	sold a working phone only to be told it wasn_'_t .
neutral	it was working when i put in bag to you but had an email two laters to be told it wasn_'_t .
neutral	so got half back for the phone then what i was expecting .
neutral	satisfied with the quality of the shed structure but a shame that the doors supplied did not fit resulting in a great deal of time and effort re - cutting and re - shaping to make the shed secure .
neutral	the woodstain provided is awful , barely covering the wood and despite six coats is being now being washed away by rain !
neutral	!
neutral	on a positive_note the delivery was on time as promised despite heavy_snow at the time .
neutral	swift delivery but left by hermes on my doorstep in full view claiming secure_location on card put through door !
neutral	i was away for a week , only saved by neighbour .
neutral	i ordered 0 packs of shelves , both of which were in very poor condition , all bashed and scratched when received .
neutral	i called big_dug and they promised to replace them .
neutral	they agreed to replace both packs on the friday as no one was to be home on the thursday to allow the damaged shelves to be picked_up .
neutral	despite this , they delivered the replacements on the thursday when no one was in .
neutral	they did however leave them on the back step , and came back on the friday to pick_up the damaged shelves .
neutral	so they got there in the end .
neutral	i don_'_t know how the original shelves were delivered though as it was so obvious they were damaged - bid visible dents and split packaging .
neutral	the packaging was flimsy .
neutral	good service but did not respond to follow - up email query re .
neutral	black_plastic hunter_wellies bags .
neutral	i sent my package on thursday 00th of september and i didn_'_t receive payment until the following friday which was a little annoying as i expected the process to be much_quicker .
neutral	other than that i was happy with mazuma '_s services .
neutral	afterwaiting the 0_weeks for delivery it became 0 then they told us they only had 0 chairs so we had to wait even longer
neutral	disappointed that i received a renewal_notice which quoted an increase of 00_% on last_year !
neutral	after discussion reduced to a mere 00_% more than last_year !
neutral	didn_'_t receive an order acknowledgement by email so contacted customer_services .
neutral	then received an email_saying that there was a delay with the order .
neutral	goods then received 0 days_later , all ok per the order .
neutral	should have received an email_explaining the delay before i had to contact customer_services ?
neutral	i ' d rate the service as only avarage i '_m afraid .
neutral	as i sent a parcel off on the 00 june and it '_s still not been delivered ( r0mtvnt ).
neutral	as this was an ebay item i have received negative_feedback due to the fact it has still not been delivered !
neutral	this has affected both my confidence in collect_+ and my ebay selling profile .
neutral	not a happy_chappy .
neutral	i ordered a seed and was given a gift of another 0 seeds even confirmed on my email . when my package got here there was only 0 free seed . so but of a let_down !!
neutral	!
neutral	i have taken out a policy but no details of my logins etc ... seems to be struggling to get details reset / resent as well !..
neutral	i hope it is not this difficult to claim if i need to ...
neutral	the delivery of the chocolates was very fast indeed .
neutral	however , the products are a little disappointing .
neutral	don_'_t get me wrong , they are nice , but not really worth the very high price paid .
neutral	the fruit flavours are a little bland , should have had more depth .
neutral	i would also say that the chocolate is not of the highest_quality .
neutral	these chocolates are no better_than what you ' d get in m & s or thorntons but are a lot more_expensive .
neutral	i bought a super mario costume and i it was brilliant for the one night i needed however this costume can be really tight and it is easy to damage and stain , i loved it though .
neutral	i used this company for a while although i was never thrilled with the service .
neutral	the sales_team are quite pushy and say there is a minimum of 0 hours for a two bed flat which is more than i wanted , but went with it .
neutral	i recently received an email offering a one of 0 hour service for £_00 but when i called they said my post_code wasn_'_t eligible .
neutral	the cleaning was generally ok but never great value and the first cleaner broke part of my shower and didn_'_t mention it .
neutral	edit_: i '_ve since been contacted by fantastic cleaners who have apologised and insisted they will amend the marketing and not repeat this mistake .
neutral	overall i am happy with the quality with the furniture .
neutral	disappointed with a sales_guy_who basically lied to me , saying that the only way to get the interest free finance done electronically was to buy insurance , he would also throw in free furniture polish , i however declined then the next_day someone phoned me offering to do the finance electronically , i said to them i thought you had to buy insurance for this they said it is the only way they process finance , when i complained about the sales_guy i asked to speak to a manager i was told they would call the next_day , needless to say i have heard from no one .
neutral	my order simply hasn_'_t turned_up , it '_s stuck in a logistics system somewhere .
neutral	i can '_t say who the fault lies with ( probably not with animed '_s dispatch in fairness ) but a budget delivery company gives budget results .
neutral	0 - stars is based on it turning_up in 0 days , 0 days_later than promised .
neutral	fingers_crossed !
neutral	been with them for years , several contracts service can be very frustrating as they go from absolutely_brilliant ( recent upgrade dealings with wales and manilla ) to absolutely shambolic ( manilla ) tech call lasting 00_mins brilliant , tech call moments before cut_off after 0 min hold ( agent did not know how , so i listened to them type for for at_least 00_mins before they put the phone down .
neutral	on the one hand , they have all the bike parts i '_ll ever need and the staff are always helpful and willing to part with a little advice on bike maintenance .
neutral	on the other , trying to get them to do work on the bike themselves is an_absolute chore .
neutral	long waiting times despite nearly empty schedules and the work is too often of questionable quality .
neutral	one particular example is when i took my bike in for a yearly once - over ( i do regular maintenance myself ) and they replaced my chain .
neutral	that night , cycling home from work , the chain snapped in the middle of a busy junction .
neutral	i always used to love going into game .
neutral	they always had what i wanted and the staff knew their stuff .
neutral	of late , however , they '_ve been slipping badly , with poor availability and damaged stock .
neutral	this was best highlighted when the cancelled all mass_effect pre_- orders shortly before release .
neutral	even worse , they deposit was refunded only as store credit .
neutral	the products are as you would expect , but given i specifically paid extra for them to be delivered within 00_hours , had the email confirmation and they didn_'_t arrive ( with no explanation or forewarning ).
neutral	i had to chase up and they arrived 0 - 0 working_days after ordering , what '_s the point ?
neutral	i was having_difficulty opting for delivery at the checkout so tried the online_chat_facility .
neutral	don_'_t bother .
neutral	it took an age to get an answer to a simple question so i hung_up and spent time trying to find the answer myself , which i eventually did .
neutral	lovely good value blinds well made .
neutral	courier left two large blinds in full view on my doorstep but told company i had signed for them - a lie .
neutral	i complained the company said it wouldn_'_t happen again but when i ordered another blind same thing happened .
neutral	i was lucky .
neutral	tive algumas dificuldades na validação do meu cartão e não fui informado que iriam ficar com uma quantia igual á que eu gastei de reserva .
neutral	bought grips as per_usual and they were as always delivered promptly and correctly .
neutral	however 0 sharpie pens on my order ( ordered blue and light blue ) were green and pink , which is annoying , but it won_'_t stop me using the shop in future , just won_'_t buy pens
neutral	i have 0 pairs of ecco_shoes that i like very much .
neutral	they are well made and comfortable .
neutral	the ordered shoes when delivered were the wrong_size and the colour was not as shown online .
neutral	it lead to disappointment .
neutral	shes were returned .
neutral	but i shall think_twice about buying from ecco another time .
neutral	but i shall live in hope .
neutral	0 ) sometimes when i looking for some hostels in city i '_m going hostel has a very good rating and comments , but when i '_m coming there it '_s so - so hostel ( nothing special ) so overrated .
neutral	0 ) we are as customers paying 00_%+ 0 , 0 dollars to hostelworld ( not to the hostel we '_ve booked )
neutral	0 ) i don_'_t understand this " hostelworld recommends " thing , why sometimes they recommends bad hostels ( about 00_% rating )
neutral	beautiful_flowers , but when looking at the picture online it makes them look bigger
neutral	it was not clear when placing the order that it was going to take two_weeks to deliver .
neutral	missed my departure as a result .
neutral	got really prompt delivery but was packed with scraps of waste polystyrene - customers aren_'_t for waste_disposal !
neutral	apart_from that , spot on service at good price .
neutral	.... if i ' d realised that the lenses make me look like some demented insect i would have asked for reflector goggles .
neutral	i am disappointed that this was not indicated on the website .
neutral	in the meantime i reserve judgment whether the system really will avoid the sort of fogging problems i have had with glasses .
neutral	ah
neutral	ordered item early on thursday ( item was in stock ) but did not receive it until late the next wednesday , there was no way of tracking its progress
neutral	they need to use a better delivery company other than royal_mail
neutral	great service - once you have arranged an appointment online or by phone .
neutral	i made an appointment for friday am which was confirmed online .
neutral	on the thursday i got two calls , one from a lady confirming friday_morning , then a second from a man saying they could not make the appointment , i would have to wait_until monday .
neutral	this was after i had arranged to have time away from work .
neutral	the fitter who eventually came was pleasant and efficient , the tyres were exactly_what i had ordered , and the whole job was done in about 00_mins .
neutral	having just purchased a bottle of medicine from chemist_direct , i was shocked to find that the carriage_costs were more than double that of the item , i did try to buy more than one of the same but was limited to one for some reason , where '_s the sense in this .
neutral	until i can buy at an economical rate i will_continue to look_elsewhere .
neutral	good computer , good delivery service .
neutral	only_downfall is the free_gift ( computer pouch ), no use whatsoever , the free pouch is more like a pencil case .
neutral	the computer purchased is for a bicycle ( small and delicate ), making the free_gift useless .
neutral	kettle as ordered but took four days from confirmation of address to dispatch .
neutral	ordering easy though paid twice the face value !, account info easy to view .
neutral	originally led to believe ticket would arrive two_weeks before event but when it didn_'_t , each time i viewed my account it said it could arrive later and later !.
neutral	kept telling_me not to worry but eventually got e_- mail four days before event saying it was despatched and would arrive three_days before .
neutral	the good points :
neutral	- easy to use website
neutral	- good value for money
neutral	- excellent delivery service using dpd ( i . e .
neutral	choice of day and lets you know what time to expect it )
neutral	the bad points :
neutral	- did not respond to my email about changing delivery address , i called up directly but was told to email a certain address
neutral	- box that arrived had the ' 0 year_guarantee seal ' broken , product looks as new but haven_'_t tried it yet and it '_s never nice to think you '_ve been sent a return .
neutral	hopefully the machine works ...
neutral	- i set a different delivery address to the invoice_address .
neutral	they then sent a letter to my delivery address asking me to call number to verify this was okay .
neutral	a commendable control , however , frustrating since the reason i gave a different delivery address was that i no_longer lived at the invoice_address .
neutral	hence a long delay before delivery .
neutral	everything was positive initially .
neutral	i pointed_out the tyres may need changing as they were close to the limit on last mot but they tested ok again and they could have been dishonest and got me to buy new ones , but they did it by the book .
neutral	very big plus .
neutral	the problem was that i had mentioned on booking ( over the phone ) that i was using an aa voucher for a free mot and asked what i needed to bring .
neutral	they gave_me the wrong info and the result was i had to pay for the mot because i hadn_'_t booked it online .
neutral	they should have let_me know this when i tried to book on the phone .
neutral	good cs would have not resulted_in this outcome , they didn_'_t seem to want to help me when it came to billing .
neutral	i worked out later i could probably have just booked it in online , then and there , for the next_day to register it in their system and they could have not charged me , but this didn_'_t happen .
neutral	as stated above there was a message from microsoft stating that there was a security certification problem with this website and strongly advising not to proceed with use of this website .
neutral	as i have dealt_with this company before and had no problem i decided to ignore the advice and proceed with an order .
neutral	goods arrived in a reasonable time with no postage_charges .
neutral	re the security problem , i sent an email on 00 / 00 /_0000 to the company stating my concerns and asking for an explanation but as of today ( 0th_july ) there has_been no response .
neutral	this is very disappointing .
neutral	ordered click and collect .
neutral	went to the store saturday as i had heard_nothing for 0 days .
neutral	store said it is not in yet we will ring you .
neutral	revisited monday_afternoon as still no contact .
neutral	assistant searched in the back and found my parcel , it had been there for days .
neutral	unlikely i would ever have got a phone_call unless i chased this one .
neutral	very poor .
neutral	prices are good , services are generally good but i have had three or four failed_collections recently without notice .
neutral	apart_from issues picking_up parcels a decent easy to use service .
neutral	i '_ve always found this site good value in the past and the overall price was still good this time .
neutral	however , it was a bit underhand to not include the new stansted forecourt charge * and * card booking_fee until the end .
neutral	just say what it costs on the first page , please .
neutral	apc couriers in slough left a card , after following the information on the card their website indicated the parcel was back at the depot and could be collected in person , when i went to collect it the woman said it was still on the van , by the time i got home the courier had left a second card , all in all a rubbish service which cost me time and money !
neutral	the only_downside is that it '_s not possible to track your package .
neutral	i have ordered a week_ago and still nothing .
neutral	i '_m surpised it takes more than a week to get it from uk to nl .
neutral	i '_ve been using usenext for over a year .
neutral	the service has_been ok but you have little idea what you download until you do and i would guess most content is pirated and therefore useless and it frequently contains viruses .
neutral	it was ok for watching some us tv_series but i got a bit fed_up after a while and decided to cancel my subscription .
neutral	i did this and cancelled the paypal automatic payment as well .
neutral	it seems matters then got a little out of control .
neutral	i received an offer of another free trial which i did not take up and despite this usenext confirmed i needed to take no further_action .
neutral	i assumed all was well at that point .
neutral	but then i started to get demands for payment for access after our agreement had been cancelled and after my access had ended .
neutral	these demands included penalty charges on top of subscription charges that i did not want and could not use .
neutral	the demands included links that required my response but directed me to missing pages .
neutral	i tried to communicate with them but they use a message portal which does not confirm the content of your message for your records and invokes the usual numb call_center reply .
neutral	in the end i had to send a recorded letter to them .
neutral	if i subscribed again , which is unlikely after my recent experience , i would confirm my cancellation by recorded mail so that i can not be scammed .
neutral	usenext - subscribers will come and go .
neutral	this has to be their decision .
neutral	you rightly have control and allow access after payment up front so you can not loose .
neutral	trying to trap customers will mean they are less likely to return .
neutral	i would probably have come_back for a while after a break of a few_months but not after this experience .
neutral	it is simply not worth the hassle .
neutral	cost shown £_000 .
neutral	after payment via_paypal cost had risen to £_000 without_any explanation that i could see .
neutral	sales man was brilliant and helpful but business manager was pushy tryed selling me something that i didnt want but tryed putting me on edge no means no .
neutral	love the products , quality and the variety .
neutral	the downside is its way to expensive .
neutral	the same accessories are much much_cheaper_elsewhere .
neutral	i used currency_solutions to transfer money from my uk bank to my us bank .
neutral	i was quite nervous as i was transferring a lot of money .
neutral	but , after a bit of a hassle , the money went through and overall i can '_t complain too much .
neutral	the hassle was that i didn_'_t realize my us bank did not accept international_transfers .
neutral	this was my fault , of course .
neutral	however i would have hoped that currency_solutions would check this first before transferring the money , because the end_result is that it cost me usd $_00 .
neutral	additionally , i was hit with a $_00 fee when the transaction did go through to my other us bank_account , for unknown reasons .
neutral	neither currency_solutions nor my bank said they took the $_00 fee , so there '_s not much i can do about it .
neutral	so basically i '_m out $_00 and realize that it '_s partially my fault , and also that it '_s not the end of the world with a transfer of this size , but ultimately i was neither happy nor unhappy with currency_solutions .
neutral	therefore i would recommend shopping around if you are looking to transfer money , but not_necessarily avoiding cs .
neutral	if you don_'_t mind waiting a long time to receive your order then weldricks is a good bet , as they are very cheap .
neutral	my order sat in the status " waiting for dispatch " for some time .
neutral	in fairness , the ts_&_cs state that orders may take up to 0 days to dispatch , but this is slow in this day .
neutral	delivered in good time as previous order was , however the flowers were quite sparse for £_00 .
neutral	so not that impressed this time .
neutral	easy parking very close to terminal with regular quick bus service .
neutral	cost little_bit more than off site parking but only waited 0 minutes for bus at 0am .
neutral	return spoiled by driver when i got off at 0 instead of 0 ( it was a long day ) and driver said he " didn_'_t go to 0 pal " then watched him drive to 0 then 0 so we had long cold walk to our car .
neutral	not impressed .
neutral	apesar_de a encomenda ter corrido bem e ter sido sempre bem atendido pela mariza da_probikeshop tive alguns problemas com a transportadora , a encomenda extraviou - se e tive de esperar mais de 00 dias que fosse entregue .
neutral	de resto quanto à qualidade do material e restante atendimento nada de negativo a assinalar .
neutral	recomendo e futuramente espero não_ter os mesmos problemas com a entrega .
neutral	supplements are good and at reasonable prices however the free delivery is terrible .
neutral	it arrives quick however the couriers so not tale care of your package .
neutral	my first was left_outside my door without even ringing in my doorbell .
neutral	the package could have been stolen very easily .
neutral	my second order was chucked over my 0th garden_fence with no leaflet through the door to tell me this .
neutral	i only notices when going to cut the grass .
neutral	if i had not chose to mow the lawn god_knows_how long it would have sat outside
neutral	delivery , second to none , but prints very pale , even after several nozzle cleans and head cleans etc .
neutral	can '_t fault delivery ,,, rapid .
neutral	booked up online and got internet confirmation but still_awaiting an e_- mail to confirm booking though website says points taken and we are booked .
neutral	we purchased an ankle_support , which was fine , the speed of delivery and everything else was fine - except the packaging .
neutral	the ankle_support could have gone in a strong a0 envelope but it came in a box which from memory was about 0 inches by 0 inches , stuffed full of paper with the tiny support bandage taking up about quarter of an inch in the bottom .
neutral	very wasteful and of course we had to pay for it .
neutral	always had good satisfaction with all order made .
neutral	dispatch in a very good timely maner and a very good communication on the customer service level .
neutral	only bad thing it is expensive !
neutral	this is the second using the service and i am quite disappointed in the quality this time round .
neutral	on the pervious occasion i was much happier but this time the flowers didnt look anything as vibrant or fresh as the photo .
neutral	the photo showed roses much larger and prominent then delivered i didn_'_t not feel value for money this time .
neutral	delivery slow due to stock running out , but was kept_informed straight_away about delay
neutral	bought 0 tickets for a barry manilow concert in southampton , tickets did not arrive , due to the fact that ups had lost them , viagogo refunded the ticket money , but i am £_000 out of pocket due to the fact that we had booked and paid for a overnight stop in a hotel , contacted ups for consequential damages , they referred me to viagogo , who as the customer was the only people who could claim , contacted them last thursday but have heard_nothing
neutral	i easily found the part i was after , and easily signed_up to pay for the part , after ringing up the customer service to ask how long it would take they said next_day , however that was not the case .
neutral	the courier came the day after , to then find he did not have it in the van , which i really needed the part .
neutral	after phoning up customer_services the part was then sent out later that day due to me desperately needing the part .
neutral	apart_from that little_confusion i had a great experience .
neutral	on the whole they have been good .
neutral	had an instance recently when they didn_'_t pickup , i spoke to internet operator who cancelled order , promised to feedback but none .
neutral	emailed but no feedback .
neutral	it cost me an additional £_00 . 00 to get it to my customer when i promised .
neutral	i am now looking for an_alternative courier agent , hopefully with better prices .
neutral	simon smith 00000 000 000
neutral	was attracted_by the £_00 joining bonus , and then went on to earn enough to get over the payout threshold .
neutral	in all_respects , pretty_much on a par with quidco in respect of rates and ease of use .
neutral	not any higher_than 0_stars because when it came to paying out there are a number of administrative obstacles to overcome - i ' d say they use some sort of breakage model to retain the commission longer_than is necessary .
neutral	eventually got paid out though , but it was quite a wait .
neutral	the tesco credit_card is pretty middle of the road in many respects .
neutral	a 00 . 0 % interest_rate as i write , and for new customers a reasonable free balance transfer and 0 % on purchases offer .
neutral	what set it apart was the rewards programme - you can use clubcard_points to convert to cash , or to convert to airmiles , with extra rewards if you use the card in a tesco petrol_station .
neutral	this was one of the very best ways of collecting airmiles until recently .
neutral	now , tesco has more or less halved the rewards points , and of course airmiles has moved to avios at virtually the same time , and now passes the taxes that were once absorbed on to you .
neutral	a double whammy hit on the benefits from using a tesco credit_card .
neutral	what was once a 0_star offer is now reduced to a middle of the road one .
neutral	still a good card , but my , how the rewards have been cut .
neutral	i don_'_t like to arrive at a rental counter and be told that they do not have the specific car model i intended to borrow .
neutral	the website say , " car model or similar ", why don_'_t they just say which ones are actually available and can be rented .
neutral	also i ' d like to see more japanese cars at the inventory .
neutral	thanks !
neutral	well , getting the point of putting a quote out there was dead simple and very easy , after that things got a little hairy , for instance_:
neutral	- changing details an asking for re - quotes was a pain , shouldn_'_t this be automatic ?
neutral	- having to hunt through the faq to find how to pay the courier an_hour before they arrived .
neutral	shiply make it easy to pay for they deposit ( their fee ) but after that you are on your own .
neutral	i assumed i would pay the rest via the site also , and had to quickly run out for the final cash , a bit_annoying that this wasn_'_t pointed_out in the ' how it works ' ( makes me think keeping it to three steps was more important than the usefulness , more marketing than anything ).
neutral	there are other oddities , but i would use the site again , for it does that first bit of the process very well and know i know some of the quirks ( there are more i can '_t remember ) i feel_comfortable using the service again .
neutral	great telephone advice and contact - best ever - unfortunately the wrong coloured suitcase delivered .
neutral	so it '_s on its way back to be replaced .
neutral	luckily i didn_'_t need it immediately .
neutral	we '_ll see how we get on with the replacement - but you still get 0_stars - not sure why .
neutral	did not rate them for the money poor quality thin rubber 0mm , would not recommend them , fitted ok
neutral	don_'_t kno wen delivered as the courier chucked it over the gate an left no card , two_days in weather ..
neutral	very good service but as i mentioned , the carrier ( ups ) did not deliver the order on time .
neutral	all items arrived quickly and as_described .
neutral	shame the box they came in was damaged and on opening the tools were at the bottom with no protection .
neutral	to be fair a load of bubble_wrap had been thrown on top , but not actually wrapped around the tools .
neutral	everything about the glasses are great except the frames are just too big , i got two_pairs and it is true for both they seem to expect people to have seriously large heads .
neutral	my last frames from glasses_direct were not a problem however .
neutral	my new neff_oven is very good and i haven_'_t even installed it yet .
neutral	i was pleased with the speed of delivery but not so pleased when i was expected to help_unload it off the van , i '_ve got a very bad ankle and could hardly lift the crate .
neutral	still we both managed without dropping it .
neutral	after a week of buying my water fountain i had heard_nothing about delivery , chased it up and was then told the line had been_discontinued .
neutral	surely they new earlier_than a week .
neutral	it was a gift for someone_who now has to wait longer_than_expected .
neutral	the fountain could be bought elsewhere .
neutral	disappointed with service
neutral	the luggage box mounting_kit didn_'_t even work properly , waste of £_00 odd pound for the box and the rack .
neutral	screws snapped at low torque .
neutral	i still want to shop_here but i '_m looking elsewhere as i am really getting annoyed with the bad quality of the products sold to me for hefty prices .
neutral	usually had no_problems spent $ 0000s over the years with supplement_warehouse but lately it seems products are getting sent in damaged condition , as my preworkout came in like a rock and had to send back and reorder .
neutral	just a hassle but return_policy is legit .
neutral	ecco_shoes are always of the highest_quality and i love them !
neutral	however , i '_ve found recently that the sizing has_become inconsistent .
neutral	in the past i '_ve found that sizes usually wear half a size more than they claim .
neutral	on this occasion one pair is perfect , but the other is slightly too small .
neutral	unfortunately this only became_apparent after i ' d worn them for a considerable time , meaning i can '_t return them even if i had been sensible enough to keep all the packaging .
neutral	despite the response from ecco , i '_ve yet to hear back from them on this matter .
neutral	i guessing now with the time that has passed i will not .
neutral	about too unsubscribe as to many emails received
neutral	first time i '_ve_used this company and they have failed to turn_up , not a good first impression on my behalf ....
neutral	i have upgraded from 0_star to 0_stars , as i believe everyone should be allowed to get the chance to correct a problem , and i did notice i had a swift response from interparcel themselves very quickly so watch this space and see what happens ......
neutral	hi " friend ??"
neutral	i placed an order for 000ml_bottle of blue statos in august cost £ 0 . 00
neutral	thought ihad ordered the same again on 00 december
neutral	but when it arrived it was a 00ml_bottle of blue statos cost £ 0 . 00
neutral	friends like that i do not like ,
neutral	james gray
neutral	bit too expensive
neutral	i have received over 00 sales emails from you already this month !
neutral	send less and i may actually read some of them .
neutral	i use the website almost every week since i '_m traveling for about 0 years .
neutral	hostelworld is perfect , it saves me a lot of time since i don_'_t have to walk around anymore looking for the right place to stay .
neutral	there are a couple of thing that really need to be improved : one of the things is that on the website you will see the starting price for dorm and private , but this can be a private room for 0 persons ?
neutral	which is pretty_much a dorm room , but it alowes hostels to make it look like there prices are a lot lower .
neutral	i always book a private for 0 people and it also means that it takes me a lot more time finding the right place , in my opinion the advertised private room should start with the price for 0 people .
neutral	the other thing which i have noticed especially in south_america is that when you book via hostelworld you end up in the rooms that are a lot of the time the rooms that are not so good .
neutral	since the hostel already is assured of the booking they will put you in the room in the back with no windows or net to the toilet and keep the room ( the nice one as advertised on the website ) for people that just walk in .
neutral	lately i '_m not using hostelworld as much purely_because of this and i have heard other travelers complain abot this as well .
neutral	i have also asked hostelworld to contact me twice regarding properties that are really bad or inconstancies with the bill or the hostelworld fee and also about fake pictures on the website , unfortunately i have never got any reply or feedback from hostelworld .
neutral	all and all a great website and idea but the customerservice does need to improve .
neutral	with concerns about cowboy outfits i tried to get reassurance about where my car would be taken to .
neutral	this was not disclosed ' in the interests of security '.
neutral	if the site security is as good as claimed then you should be more open about it .
neutral	it was surprising to be asked to call twice ( at 00_mins and 0 mins ) before dropping_off .
neutral	on arriving back we had a wait in the cold for longer_than_expected - we were told that this was due to a burst water main causing routing problems .
neutral	the car had covered 00 miles from when i dropped it off which seemed to be quite a lot - but then i had no idea where the car was parked .
neutral	there was a key scratch about 0 " long close to the handle on the drivers door but as the driver who dropped it of shot off fairly quickly i was unable to point this out to him .
neutral	ordered a mobile_phone case and although the communication was good , the item never arrived .
neutral	i was told that new stock would be in by the end of the week .
neutral	i waited 0_weeks until after my order and decided to request a refund which , in all fairness was prompt and hassle_free .
neutral	this company in my view is unethical and the service is so so .
neutral	ok , my phone was finally unlocked , but takes them several days to do it .
neutral	great service and staff all spoilt by poor price match policy .
neutral	i found three web sites cheaper two in europe which they would not match which i understand .
neutral	however the third was amazon uk the glasses supplied by sun_glasses shop and they wouldn_'_t match the amazon price !!
neutral	that is poor price match claim
neutral	ordered my flowers two day previously but did not set a time .
neutral	my wife finished work at 0000 flowers delivered at 0000 .
neutral	bit_disappointing ?
neutral	when i booked the transfer i was told , and it says on there website that the shuttle will do a maximum of 0 stops !!!!
neutral	we had 0 on transfer from and back to airport .
neutral	buy products but pushy on insurance , i feel that information they give out is incorrect as actually confirmed with samsung re their warranty they stated that samsungs warranty isn_'_t worth paper wrote on just for inherit problems not right as confirmed with samsung 0 year_warranty is a strong as any warranty , apart_from that prices not bad
neutral	the order and delivery process of my furniture from oakea were very good although the name of the firm was transformed to stock0u sometime between order and delivery , just to throw in a little_confusion .
neutral	one of the items i purchased was a somerset single wardrobe which required assembly .
neutral	the assembly was reasonably easy until i encountered 0 rear fixing_holes in the base that did not match with fixing_holes in the base of the sides and the only way to complete the assembly was to use the back to keep the sides roughly at right angles to fit inside the lip of the base and secure it with the 0 front fixings which did match .
neutral	this was a fault of the foreign manufacturers but detracted from the whole oakea experience .
neutral	the wardrobe is now functioning reasonably well despite the slight forward bow in the middle of the door .
neutral	i have previously bought and loaded your cartridges without_any difficulty .
neutral	sadly this time though , the black 000 one has_been o . k .
neutral	the coloured 000 will not load correctly and i have ben forced to buy a cannon which is far more_expensive .
neutral	it tells you on the website that postage on orders over £_00 is free .
neutral	however if you need an online consultation and a private_prescription from their own doctor (£_00 ), the postage costa are a minimum of £ 0 . 00 even if your medicine bill is over £_00 .
neutral	caveat_emptor .
neutral	otherwise the prices are good and the service is quick .
neutral	no issues there .
neutral	delighted to get texts and emails progressing the delivery of my order , but a tad disappointed in the actual quality of the flowers , after less_than 00_hrs the petals are falling
neutral	i ordered 0 pairs of the same style glasses with different_colour lenses , when i recieved my order one pair was clear lenses and not tinted as i had ordered . i have now returned the faulty pair and m hoping they will manage to supply me with the correct lenses this time . not very impressed . but they were helpful when i phoned .
neutral	nice flowers delivered very fast .
neutral	unfortunately no email was sent to confirm the order had been received , and the invoice is sent as a pdf attachment , which is much less convenient than just having the details written in the email .
neutral	the laptops i have had from dell have been good , but customer service is awful .
neutral	the last time i called customer service they gave_me a quote for support , then tried to increase it during the call .
neutral	they took_ages to attempt to resolve the problem but were ultimately unsuccessful .
neutral	it took hours .
neutral	i am surprised they were not more familiar with their own products .
neutral	on another occasion they quoted me £_00 to replace the cds i got when i first bought the laptop .
neutral	i took it to a shop where they reinstalled everything for £_00 , saving me £_00 .
neutral	the barrier detector failed to read my number_plate , so i went to the booth enroute to the airport to get it sorted .
neutral	the guy couldn_'_t help me and told me i needed to return to the booth when i came back for my car and haven ticket validated .
neutral	now the whole point of paying a premium_rate to park right at the terminal is to allow a fast getaway when returning late from a business trip .
neutral	you need to introduce a process that allows
neutral	the booth guy to put licence_plate numbers onto tickets .
neutral	i had to queue on my return , tired , grumpy and paying for the privilege !
neutral	uk mail delivered this parcel .
neutral	i had no idea when it was coming so couldn_'_t make plans to be in or to offer alternative_arrangements .
neutral	i didn_'_t even know that they were the company bringing it .
neutral	thankfully my neighbours were in and accepted it on our behalf .
neutral	as you can see from my review the key objective was acheived - i got the parcel .
neutral	but that was more by luck than any proactive planning or engagement from the delivery company .
neutral	the only real downside on this trip was the hotel_room , which was in the basement area and close to am area where staff worked , hence early morning noise .
neutral	also , even_though the room was quite adequate , bathroom spacious , being below street level takes any ambiance off the stay .
neutral	enquired when we arrived , but hotel full , so no oportunity of any change of room .
neutral	also from an overall hotel aspect it lacked a nice area where guests could sit and relax , eg a nice lounge_area , rather_than just an extension on the reception_area .
neutral	otherwise , the service provided by tickettree was quite good .
neutral	the theatre_seats were quite acceptable and the train_tickets , being open type ones was very acceptable .
neutral	hotel location to covent_garden and theatre land was also quite good ' nevermind being reasonably close to oxford_street , using the bus , so that my wife could enjoy some shopping .
neutral	overall we had a good trip , which could have been that much_better if the hotel accomodation at the grange clarendon , had been that little_bit more acceptable .
neutral	rooms other than in the basement are much more acceptable , and it did make one wonder , although management denied this , that this room was allocated because we were on a " package ".
neutral	i ordered 0 tyres , checked by phone they had been delivered to the fitting oultet .
neutral	when i arrived to have them fitted they found out that they were of 0 different_sizes .
neutral	this required them to re - order and for me to come_back the next_day for fitting .
neutral	this is not good enough and not the service i would expect .
neutral	disappointment and a whole morning of my time wasted .
neutral	do not specify your costume size enough
neutral	buses frequent , ground very rough , not enough instructions when you get back on how to exit the car_park , make instructions on email more detailed .
neutral	ordered signs for next_day delivery , but in the end , when they did not come someone had to pick htem up from a different depot
neutral	shed was all i hoped it would be .
neutral	time_consuming to put up ( took me three_days , with no help ) but strdy and rigid when bolted to the ground .
neutral	vital to have a level base , and to make_sure the base is square .
neutral	i did specify on the order that i would be away for ten days , so please ensure that the shed wasn_'_t delivered until after that .
neutral	why then was i phoned up , whilst on holiday at the other end of the country , by the courier company wanting to deliver my shed ?
neutral	when it eventually arrived it had been with the couriers for over 00 days , as they couldn_'_t find another suitable delivery slot !
neutral	price competitive and service very good compared to daa prices .
neutral	it was a good way to introduce me to the hotel and services .
neutral	i '_ve ordered heaps from them , which have all been really good - however , the sign that i ordered had a chunk of my telephone_number missing off the bottom :( considering it was obviously advertising a business , i found incredulous that it had passed their quality control .
neutral	i also ordered a business stamp , but it was that hard to get into , that it broke :(
neutral	everything else i ordered had been fine .
neutral	the processing delay of a certain royal_mail selection is a bit of a pain and mystery to me .
neutral	d . o . a .
neutral	service is of no use as i believe there isn_'_t one .
neutral	it '_s a little hard to write a review because i '_m still_waiting for my order to be shipped a week after i placed it .
neutral	not a huge problem but the " delivery in 0 - 0 business days " stated on the web_site was misleading .
neutral	vesternet '_s customer_services_department responded quickly enough when i asked about the status of my order although " sorry " would have earned them one more star than the somewhat cursory response i did receive .
neutral	postage cost too high so next time will look_elsewhere
neutral	we had a delivery of an electric_towel_radiator that had no brackets , after several phone_calls , sending pictures to prove what was wrong a replacement was supplied a week_later , strangely both items were delivered by plumb_center part of the wolsey group .
neutral	i have found the online service from feel good contact_lenses to be reliable and trustworthy however i think there is room from improvement when it comes to communicating with customers by telephone .
neutral	if i had been asked to rate them immediately after delivery it would probably have five_stars .
neutral	in terms of what you ' re paying them to do they are really very good .
neutral	since then however i have received a lot of email from them , all basically asking me to tell them how good they are .
neutral	the other thing which really got up my nose was the underhand attempt to sell me an extended_warranty by basically calling my wife and just asking her for credit_card_details .
neutral	the heel wedges which i ordered arrived the next_day - incredible service .
neutral	price was reasonable too .
neutral	however , they will not stay in place in the shoe and contact adhesive does not work .
neutral	what do i do ?
neutral	?
neutral	araldite them in permanently in 0 pairs of shoes ( minimum )
neutral	paid for item to be delivered saturday but not delivered until monday .
neutral	otherwise item good .
neutral	i found the information on the website and the service when ordering exceptionally good and it was on this that i decided to buy .
neutral	the chaps that delivered the bed were also exceptional .
neutral	they couldn_'_t do enough to help and worked really hard to take the very heavy super_king mattress and the divans to the third floor of my house .
neutral	they were pleasant , tidy and efficient .
neutral	as for the mattress / bed - i must_admit i am disappointed .
neutral	we spent £ 0 , 000 on an artisan luxury and i had expected something that was probably as good as a £_0k + vi spring .
neutral	perhaps i was a bit naive .
neutral	we went for the recommended firmness of the mattress and i can feel the springs on my sides .
neutral	i had expected the padding to take away all feeling of the springs .
neutral	i wouldn_'_t say it is very uncomfortable - i sleep in many hotels that are much worse , but at the same time i do sleep in other hotel beds that are better .
neutral	it has to be said that my wife ( who went for a soft as she is lighter ) does not have this issue and is happy .
neutral	i don_'_t think there is anything wrong with the mattress - certainly not enough to justify sending it back ( and i am sure if i had asked jr would have probably accepted / swapped it ).
neutral	i think i will probably end up buying something else in a few_years time as_opposed to the 00 - 00 years that i expected .
neutral	i thought long and hard about whether i should give it three or four_stars , but as the product is ok in my mind rather_than good or great i went for three .
neutral	everything was very easy to follow from the music_magpie website .
neutral	but there '_s not much money to be made from cds .
neutral	one cd ( out of about 00 ) was not recognised by the site .
neutral	good potential and resources ... but just wish they would stop being a mouthpiece for the government and stop covering up the illegal wars committed oversees .
neutral	the service and delivery time was first_class with molarclaen but i was disappointed with the product .
neutral	the replacement heads for my electric_toothbrush were much to tight and were very difficult to remove after use , my wife was not strong_enough to do it herself .
neutral	i have bought many replacement heads off other_suppliers without_any_problems .
neutral	i would not use molarclean again .
neutral	ordered a guitar at 0pm on the thursday , realised it wasn_'_t the exact one i wanted ( my mistake , the details on the website were fine but i was doing it quickly before i rushed out the door ) and sent an email almost_immediately to cancel the order .
neutral	received an email from dawsons later on the following friday to say " apologies , we shipped it before we read your email ".
neutral	so , in one way good ( speed ) and the other way bad ( speed !).
neutral	don_'_t really see much point having a customer service email address if they ' re not reviewing it regularly .
neutral	but the really most frustrating thing was the guitar being reduced by £_000 the very next_day - grrrrrrrrrr !
neutral	did consider returning the guitar at cost and then reordering but couldn_'_t be_bothered with the hassle to be honest .
neutral	i tried to pay with 0 different debit_cards unsuccessfully .
neutral	so i had to make a bank tranfer and pay the pertinent fee .
neutral	since i started to use tranferwise i '_ve never been able to pay the deposit by debit_card .
neutral	very annoying !
neutral	!
neutral	i am always disappointed at the delivery times .
neutral	you spend hours creating these items and want to see them the following_day .
neutral	i realize that it is difficult to compare but ebay and amazon deliver within days .
neutral	however the price , the products and the end results are worth the time ...
neutral	i '_ve been with hsbc since it was midland bank plc !
neutral	it was where my dad took me to open my first bank_account when i was just a child .
neutral	at the beginning of june i was able to successfully log_into my current account via the online portal they have .
neutral	no_problems .... come the end of the month , my online access is no_longer in place .
neutral	several failed_attempts to access my account resulted_in the account becoming blocked .
neutral	so i '_ve called the customer_services and the person on the end of the phone can '_t tell me why my account is no_longer accessible online .
neutral	she can see there has_been an instruction to remove the service .... but it didn_'_t come from me - the account_holder , and just so you know , i run a pretty good account !
neutral	anyway , i '_m given the option to go into a branch to pick_up one of their security devices to access the online service or have it sent out to me .
neutral	ok , but still doesn_'_t answer the question - why was my access removed in the first place .
neutral	i await the response from their " investigations team ".
neutral	not impressed .
neutral	recently taken out 0 contracts with three , a mobile_phone contract and broadband contract .
neutral	phone first , i '_ve been pretty impressed so_far wti the service i '_ve received .
neutral	the website is easy to navigate and when i '_ve needed to speak with someone on the phone they '_ve been very helpful and knowledgeable .
neutral	broadband was a very different experience , the lady in the store was a bit clueless and tried to sell me something that wasn_'_t in the system at that time - therefore not able to process a transaction .
neutral	so that option was quickly withdrawn from the list of options_available to purchase on the day .
neutral	the deal i purchased was a rolling_contract , 00 days cancellation notice .
neutral	i wanted to test their service for that initial 00 days and then if i was happy , take out a new contract .
neutral	so my aim was to cancel the service on the day of purchase , thus giving the company the 00 days notice they required .
neutral	trying to get through to someone to make this happen was like trying to get blood out of a stone .
neutral	after 0 telephone_calls ( 0 of which were cut_off ) i finally found someone_who was able to help and talk things through with me .
neutral	i won_'_t go into the specifics but i will say that after that conversation three and i were best budies again .
neutral	though i was on the verge of cancelling everything and taking back the broadband items i ' d purchased .
neutral	so a mixed review here ....
neutral	customer service wasn_'_t brilliant but one person turned things around for me .
neutral	because of that i '_ll rate their service 0 .
neutral	could do with some training of their telephone staff in helpfullness and knowledge .
neutral	i know these_guys get a bad_reputation for all the things they do and don_'_t do , but so_far i '_ve had an ok experience with them .
neutral	didn_'_t much like the idea of being tied in for 0yrs after they took over my previous phone / internet supplier but touch_wood the service ( not customer service .... line service ) had been acceptable .
neutral	customer service - on the few occasions i '_ve had to call them , i '_ve managed to get through to a human_being fairly quickly .
neutral	peak_times are to be avoided though and with it not being an 0000 telephone_number , that does grate somewhat !
neutral	bt have an 0000 number to speak with customer_services ... why can '_t these_guys ?
neutral	oh and nuisance callers , why do i have to pay to block sales calls ?
neutral	in a round about way it '_s as if they are sponsoring the cold callers - i wouldn_'_t be surprised if that was the case .
neutral	similar to a commonly heald belief that the antivirus companies are behind the viruses .... to get us to buy their software .
neutral	true / false ?
neutral	who_knows !
neutral	i give them a 0 * for now until they demonstrate outstanding service in one way shape or form .
neutral	my flights were rescheduled , meaning that i would have to take two more days off work and be stuck in shanghai airport for over 00_hours on both the outward and return journeys .
neutral	as i wasn_'_t given any alternative , i had to cancel my flights with budgetair .
neutral	i then asked for the full_refund i was entitled to .
neutral	initially , budgetair said that it would take 00 - 00 weeks to refund me the ticket amount , but they wouldn_'_t refund the flight booking_fee , credit_card costs or airline failure service .
neutral	after making an official_complaint to the airline and writing about this experience on trust_pilot , i was given a full_refund within a few_days .
neutral	i have been a customer for long .
neutral	i want them to be able to remember my details my cars details my credit_card_details if i opt to .
neutral	i want the site to allow me in with a username and password and allow me to see all my previous bookings without me having to recall a booking number .
neutral	i want to feel that i am a known customer to them otherwise it is easy enough to go to any other site and book through them afresh
neutral	although we got there in the end , it was frustrating and complicated trying to book shipments in the australia and nz .
neutral	there was no explanation as to why the addresses we had were not acceptable necessitating a phone_call and the paperwork side was difficult to follow as well .
neutral	this could all be simplified considerably and has put us off using them again .
neutral	yo udo not have enough info about your products on the site ...
neutral	item great , price great , let_down by delivery company who dropped it and damaged the corner !
neutral	probably one of the best lenders out there , although the rates are a bit high , as are all payday_loans but , this is better_than most .
neutral	it annoys_me that you have a miliion brokers and affiliates to these things .
neutral	word of mouth is good enough , we all know what the sites are we don_'_t need to pay to contact them or receive a million text '_s , e_- mails and calls from " company '_s that can help " so go direct to them .
neutral	cyber_power system have been responsive in speaking to me about my order and let_me adjust it slightly after the order has_been placed but due to the computer being shipped from us , delivery has takes 00 - 00 days and due to technical issue with the screen i '_m now having to wait another week for delivery .
neutral	cyber_power system have said they will compensate me with a freebie but i am disappointed how long its taking especially being a gamer .
neutral	i questioned via e_mail the part that i selected on the spares website , the respondent answered by saying chances are it was correct but couldnt be sure .
neutral	just tried it today but its incorrect .
neutral	the service was slow compared to other items i have ordered over the internet , ie getting it dispatched then the length of time to arrive .
neutral	nice solid bookcase , pity the shelf sags so had to fit an intermediate support
neutral	no point in complaining since if you cannot make a functional shelf you would not understand
neutral	always on the phone when you get to the store .
neutral	clearly more comfortable with online and telesales .
neutral	prices are unbeatable tho
neutral	overall i have enjoyed going through_quidco .
neutral	but as the title_says some transactions can be iffy .
neutral	let_me explain .
neutral	we registered 0 cards with quidco ( my wife and i ) at times the card_details got erased so any purchases made did not register .
neutral	it was only when i tried to chase them up i noticed the cards had been erased , so no payments .
neutral	we do not always save receipts so cannot claim on these .
neutral	also account shows car insurance payment paid yet this has not been paid .
neutral	does not seem point in sending yet another message as i never get a satisfactory reply , even when i get a telephone_call .
neutral	have considered closing account down several_times but keep hoping it will improve .
neutral	will stick with it a little_longer to hope for improvement .
neutral	i was sent an email_stating the day the product would be delivered on .
neutral	when i made a special trip to the store that evening it was not there .
neutral	the staff phoned head_office to only to be told it would be arriving tomorrow .
neutral	( i got the impression this was not uncommon )
neutral	i then had to phone the store the next_day to see if it had arrived which it had .
neutral	ordered on saturday .
neutral	it was supposed to be with me within 0 working_days as it was in stock .
neutral	it was finally dispatched on wednesday and arrived on thursday - if you count the saturday that is 0 working_days ...
neutral	other than that , all went well .
neutral	i scanned and posted my dvds in a timely_manner .
neutral	the processing in the other end was not so good .
neutral	i did three trades back to back and had to contact customer_services each time to see where my cash was .
neutral	i did receive my cheques but if your looking for a quick turn_around then try a different company .
neutral	purchase and delivery went very smoothly .
neutral	the only issue was the omission of the crucial battery_charger needed with the di0_groupset .
neutral	to be fair this was dispatched with next_day delivery as soon as sigma where advised however it was disappointing .
neutral	discussion talked of a ' goodie box ' being in with the bike however this was not there and was never received ( though of course ) the ' goodie box ' might . have been the charger , which i think should have been seen as an essential , not a ' goodie '.
neutral	that aside however a pretty good service .
neutral	i have found that the delivery service or courier used are very very poor .
neutral	i think that they need to change delivery service .
neutral	nevertheless the items purchased are of good quality .
neutral	i bought a motor for a sebo vac which was great and they had a great video_tutorial .
neutral	they then asked me to review my purchase so i wasted 00_minutes writing a review only to have it rejected because it wasn_'_t just about the motor .
neutral	i guess they '_ll reject this too .
neutral	you couldn_'_t make it up ...
neutral	a good company but the computer says no !
neutral	i ordered a vax hoover .
neutral	they used yodel .
neutral	a rubbish company .
neutral	yodel pretended to deliver , gave invalid cards and returned item back to makro ( after i had complained to makro ).
neutral	makro , without contacting me simply refunded the money for the item without offering me any choice of whether i still needed the item .
neutral	======================
neutral	ordered again after a few weeks - another promotion , delivered very promptly .
neutral	hence overall 0_stars .
neutral	i am a 00 year_old retired building_trade site agent , accustomed to reading plans , but found your instructions confusing , possibly made out by some chinese personage .
neutral	when fully erected i thought it would be a little more stable than it is .
neutral	despite the bracing it is still wibbly wobbly .
neutral	i have had to use shading on the glazing and have still lost a lot of plants through leaf scorch .
neutral	i have previously had good dealings with this company and really do admire the ethics and enthusiasm of the founder .
neutral	what disapointed me for my last visit was that i was willing to spend money for some minx speakers and an av_receiver .
neutral	i wanted a specific av_receiver that was not in stock in the bournemouth store , and although some were showing at other stores further away , the salesman said i would have to go there to pick it up , and recomended a more_expensive alternative make .
neutral	to cut a long_story_short , after looking online and finding some , i called a different branch of rs who sent me the av_receiver for a very small fee ( under £ 0 ).
neutral	why did the salesman not tell me this could be done ?
neutral	i presume he wanted the sale of the larger av_receiver .
neutral	i now do not feel like i can trust the guys in the bournemouth store , as i almost purchased from another store , or ebay .
neutral	so as i was also buying another tv , this custom will now go_elsewhere .
neutral	minx speakers are great , unfortunately rs stopped accepting amex
neutral	our evening_meal was not great probably because we were the only ones eating but the room and light breakfast was good .
neutral	my only complaint is in relation to the various parking levels .
neutral	why not put up signage when motorist is on level par with flight departures ?
neutral	use them a lot .
neutral	place your order and you get it as_described each time .
neutral	but if you order the wrong product , or it gets sent to the wrong_address , you pretty_much have to fend for yourself - not ideal .
neutral	still if you don_'_t make any mistakes , you will be cool .
neutral	hi just placed an order with this web_site physioroom , stuff was dispatched on the 00 of aug its now the 00th still no order has arrived , heading off on holiday now for a couple of weeks in a bit pain so will be a while before i get my order or if i get it very disappointed .
neutral	the products seem really great - only_downside was getting everything through in 0 different packages over a period of a few weeks !
neutral	ordered an office desk from these_guys a month_ago now which has just arrived .
neutral	when i ordered i didn_'_t clock the delivery estimate of 00 - 00 days but when i realised i thought that must just mean the maximum_amount of time it will take them to deliver an in - stock item .
neutral	what i now realise is the desk was made to order , but still didn_'_t arrive within 00 working_days , it was more like 00 .
neutral	if they would just be honest and put made to order on their site it would have saved me a lot of annoyance .
neutral	customer service is good , they get back to you quite quickly , although they offered no apology for the lateness of the delivery even when i said i wasn_'_t exactly happy .
neutral	the desk itself looks very robust , the main top part is very heavy and is the only bit i have removed from it '_s packaging so_far .
neutral	it all seems well_packaged , so i '_m happy there .
neutral	all in all i '_m fairly happy but next time i make a purchase for office_furniture i will keep a closer eye on what they have in - stock and what '_s made to order as a month is a long time to wait .
neutral	pas_de problèmes avec gamola , bon produits …
neutral	en revanche , ils viennent de changer de service de_livraison .
neutral	jusque - là parcel_force et gls , jamais aucuns problèmes .
neutral	et nous voilà avec fedex , carton en mauvais état , livreur avec_la cigarette au bec … ce_n ' est_pas la première fois avec fedex que cela se passe mal .
neutral	ne prenez jamais ce service de_livraison .
neutral	a la prochaine commande , je demanderai un autre service de messagerie , si ce_n ' est_pas possible , je_ne passerai pas commande .
neutral	i bought shafts whitch were suppose to be in stock , but weren_'_t .
neutral	took time to be informed ( 0 days ) and a lot more ( almost two_weeks ) to be delivered at last …
neutral	i have had a reasonably good experience with petfleas , the first order was a bit of a problem with the wrong food being sent out and the delivery not being on time .
neutral	but i placed another order and had it delivered to my work place , not problems with this one .
neutral	on the whole i am pleased with the service .
neutral	i had been with o0 for a number of years , and generally their service was above_average .
neutral	however , i moved_house , and that was the beginning of a very sorry_saga .
neutral	in a period of 00 months i had 0 routers .
neutral	each one had a different problem , ranging_from getting so hot , i did not need heating , random drop_outs , disconnections , and the list_goes on .
neutral	finally having had enough of the poor quality of routers being provided , i contacted them and explained that they needed to get their act_together .
neutral	in fairness the customer service were every helpful , waiving the early_termination fees .
neutral	but , it is only since i have moved to another provided that the cheapness of their routers has_become_increasingly apparent .
neutral	since i have changed , i am not able to get a wireless_signal anywhere in the house .
neutral	not just sat on top of the router .
neutral	this review is now a little redundant as sky is buying out o0s ' customer base .
neutral	i am pleased to see that yodel are making serious efforts to improve their level of service .
neutral	i have been a catalogue customer for a number of years and yodel took over the courier service .
neutral	items would regularly disappear , text_messages saying they had tried to deliver but there was noone home ( i had been in all day ).
neutral	finally after a number of complaints to the catalogue and the courier , i resorted to contacting the ceo of both companies .
neutral	very recently , i have noticed a considerable improvement ( it would have been near_impossible to get worse ).
neutral	but yodel have a lot of work to do before i have 000_% confidence in their service .
neutral	on the 00th_march , i ordered an item which was ' temporarily_out of stock ' however it '_s now nearly 00 days_later and i '_ve yet to receive an update as to when i might receive the item which is rather frustrating .
neutral	aside from this , the website boasts great pricing and is easy to use .
neutral	happy with the goods but the company seems to be based in gib - this may account for slower_than_expected deliveries .
neutral	paid for 0 day delivery , items received 0 days_later .
neutral	good prices though .
neutral	we were told to bring the car back empty and were charged 00_euros for a full_tank of fuel .
neutral	this was a bad deal for us as we didn_'_t use a full_tank .
neutral	the car was small , diesel and economical so the empty_tank policy is a money making game for the rental company .
neutral	on looking at the paperwork , we should have been offered an option to bring the car back full , which we weren_'_t .
neutral	it encourages uneconomical driving as you feel that you want to use up the fuel that you have been made to pay for .
neutral	a bad policy all_round and may put us off renting from goldcars in the future .
neutral	was very happy with items although purchased two items had to pay 000 for next_day delivery for both items but arrived in one package ( disappointed ) did not offer one delivery charge back .
neutral	customer service replies were very slow ,
neutral	the claim policy is terrible and does not allow ease of use or an acceptable time to make a claim .
neutral	iceland send products to the overseas company in spain , they should make_sure that the expats in spain are not ripped_off by overseas ,
neutral	some of the prices charged are really extortionate
neutral	programs are really poor now far to many repeats and programs are repeated far to quickly , some are tarted up to look different total crap
neutral	the company service is getting worse unfriendly staff , hard to contact and are becoming the biggest ripoff
neutral	not very user_friendly nowdays
neutral	tomany errors
neutral	it would have been more useful for them to specify up front what deductions they make for blemishes and other small things on the phone , because you send it in with one price and then you get a different price in return which you can '_t do much about except accept .
neutral	that leaves you feeling dissatisfied .
neutral	everything else seems okay .
neutral	prices are fair , i order a pair of cycling_bib and went by their sizing_chart but the fit was not accurate .
neutral	i am waiting for the exchange item to arrive .
neutral	ordering appeared to be efficient and easy however they were let_down by their carrier delaying delivery by 0 working_days .
neutral	this was a shame as it was our first experience of ordering from extera .
neutral	the drum machine was received very quickly but only one drum stick was suppied .
neutral	despite following this up no satisfactory reply has_been received only " looking into it ".
neutral	shame as this after sales experience spoilt the swift despatch and delivery of the item .
neutral	ordered 00 roses at £_00 - they were supposed to be aqua packed for freshness but they werent .
neutral	they looked nice enough , and 0 week on they are still looking good so i can '_t complain .
neutral	quite a lot of money for what they were though .
neutral	note also that the prices you see are not what you pay - they add an extra £ 0 delivery fee at the checkout which is pretty cheeky imo .
neutral	happy with the service , however , i wish the suppliers would take_note of the requirement of a day '_s notice of delivery , and not just turn_up on the doorstep .
neutral	it causes no end of problems as we live on a busy a - road and we have to move cars around to gain_access to the tank .
neutral	looks good , but in_spite of very careful fitting , the flexible seal barely touches the top of the bath so there are slight leaks when you shower .
neutral	i ordered 0 pairs to later find out a pair i ordered were now out of stock .
neutral	how can this be , surely i shouldnt be able to order them in the first place .
neutral	regards ,
neutral	paul
neutral	product looks good and is cheaper_than other_sites but same product works out same price on other_sites once include delivery .
neutral	also get scoop and mixer_bottle on other_sites .
neutral	prob won_'_t use again .
neutral	not really impressed with the quality of the book in comparison with a company i have used before .
neutral	delivery was quick and efficient though .
neutral	the chosen courier service is letting pet_supermarket down .
neutral	my order for aquarium gravel was dropped over a 0 foot back gate , splitting the packaging and resulting in gravel everywhere .
neutral	my aquarium filter pads arrived with half the boxes crushed and took a long time to arrive .
neutral	one of the few places , i found on line with the product i wanted ; although hardly a bargain .
neutral	took weeks to arrive .
neutral	in fairness , they emailed me to say it would be delayed - and i decided to hang on .
neutral	its almost there ...
neutral	very 00 / 00 on the staff service / customer_care .
neutral	generally my clothing service has_been ace , including a product return , but bike servicing , wheel servicing and a new bike build a year or so ago was a disaster .
neutral	i have heard the same from a couple good friends .
neutral	we have purchased a now four of five bikes and a mountain of kit over the years so we are a regular customer .
neutral	tickets for the european outdoor film tour on 00th_nov at the rgs are £_00 at the door or £_00 in advance .
neutral	but to buy in advance costs £ 0 . 00 postage plus £_00 which makes it cheaper to buy at the door .
neutral	goods were very good but i would like to point out . that according to the delivery driver werescanned for any faults at the depot ( which may have been correct at the time they were delivered to the depot ) when i received them one corner of the desk top was damaged ( it does not bother me because the damge was out of the way and did not show when assembled and i could not be_bothered to complain ) but iwould question he delivery serice because they are at fault any damage outside the depot is their responsibilty ( they obviousley try to avoid that ).
neutral	t allison
neutral	after i had paid for my order i received an e_- mail to request a new prescription , which i had already sent , i phoned the office about this and it was informed that for some reason it had arrived but was not put on my account , i then received a further e_- mail asking for a prescription and when i replied asking ' to sort yourselves out or i would change my supplier ' i was sent a further e_- mail apologising and the new order was sent .
neutral	cheap prices , but 0 attempts needed to design a leaflet as website constantly crashed .
neutral	no ability to see order pdf once sent , and delivery slow ( still not arrived ).
neutral	maybe better to pay more and go eleswhere ?
neutral	i '_ve said it in one_sentence
neutral	the furniture is excellent and the delivery drivers where great .
neutral	i would buy from oak_furniture_land again but i made the mistake of doing it online , go in store if you wish to buy and hope you don_'_t have any_problems as they are incredibly slow at dealing_with issues .
neutral	it took almost a week for there head_office to get back to me after sending 0 / 0 emails to them .
neutral	i also find outrageous that if there is a problem and you wish to speak to someone you are forced to call a 0000 number after spending over a £ 0000 i found this unacceptable .
neutral	so over all great quality furniture good delivery service but customer service when dealing_with anything very poor .
neutral	cost £ 0 .
neutral	for next_day delivery and the goods pitched up 0 days after ordered .
neutral	0nd_class post would have been quicker and cheaper .
neutral	are in the process of re - tilling the bathroom and wanted brick style bevelled edge tiles .
neutral	most of this type are quite expensive but tons of tiles was the best value for money .
neutral	however i found the delivery of £_00 ish pounds to be horrifically expensive considering there are some many companies that offer free delivery these days .
neutral	other than this the turnaround time was good .
neutral	i would recommend you at_least offer a free / cheaper option for delivery with a longer delivery time .
neutral	customers pay over the odds on a 0 year contract for you to offer just £_000 for my galaxy_s0 which i recycled . the customer if there willing to take another contract out should be able to get some sort of discount on top of that to . maybe more data who_knows .
neutral	good quick service just let_down with value for money .
neutral	gostei do serviço !
neutral	muito rápido , fui bem esclarecido e gostei dos preços praticados nos artigos que comprei .
neutral	o único aspecto negativo foi a embalagem .
neutral	descuidada e com pouco profissionalismo .
neutral	encomendei um pedaleiro shimano_xt , que veio embrulhado em cartão e plástico , bem como a cassete xt de 00v .
neutral	os pedais que encomendei vieram na caixa original e bem acondicionados .
neutral	o_material chegou bem , sem danos , mas fiquei a duvidar se a pedaleira e a cassete eram artigos originais e se tinham sido inspecionados pelo departamento da qualidade .
neutral	um aspecto importante a melhorar !
neutral	i placed an order for an arrangement to be sent to sue , at the skewen medical centre , and another one for diane , at the same address on friday the 00th_september .
neutral	the order for sue was placed first and i did not see the piece where i could put in the delivery date i wanted .
neutral	the order went through very quick and it was only after confirmation of the order that i realised the flowers would be delivered the next_day , on saturday .
neutral	since a well - known firm as serenata_flowers is , i thought someone would know that medical surgeries are closed on the weekend .,
neutral	just to be sure , i sent an email to your offices explaining the mistake i made and requesting that the flowers be sent on the following_monday , the 00th - the same day i had asked for the second arrangement , for diane , to be delivered .
neutral	i asked that someone get back to me so the problem could be sorted .
neutral	no one did .
neutral	i sent a second email with the same request , asking either for a return email , or for a telephone_call , to let_me know that the deliveries would be made yesterday .
neutral	now , i am asking you to do me the favour of telling_me when the deliveries were made .
neutral	i can be reached on 00000_000000 during the day or in the evening .
neutral	thank_you
neutral	jay hill
neutral	great service from go_electrical
neutral	when i first tried to ring i got brushed off .
neutral	on second time of ringing i got decent advice .
neutral	excellently quick service and returns .
neutral	you get what you asked for .
neutral	it would be good to have an visual indication of the size of the bulbs .
neutral	eg against a coin .
neutral	i was a customer of another isp up until a couple of months_ago .
neutral	in august i went into what i thought was my isp '_s web_site to check my billing statement .
neutral	i got a message on a web_page ( i don_'_t know how i ended_up on that page ) to say there was a problem with my account and gave an 0000 number to ring .
neutral	when i dialled the number i got an operator who claimed they were signing_up customers to a new account .
neutral	i then noticed the different name ( time talk ).
neutral	i told the operator that i still had time left on my current_contract but i was told not to worry_about it , that it would be taken_care of .
neutral	i had the definite impression that my isp was aware of this .
neutral	realisation that time talk was actually a competitor poaching customers from my isp came later , but i stupidly allowed myself to be drawn in .
neutral	my isp charged me a £_00 contract break fee , which they took out of my direct_debit .
neutral	for a few weeks the time talk customer advisers insisted i shouldn_'_t worry , just mail them a pdf of the statement , and they ’ ll pass it to their accounts_department for processing .
neutral	a lot of sympathy and telling_me how bad my isp was by charging such a large_amount and they would write to them on my behalf and urge them to refund it ..
neutral	i have now accepted my mistake , and as a result of this experience i want to leave time talk and go_elsewhere .
neutral	their cancellation advisor told me they would charge me a contract breaking fee of over £_000 .
neutral	i have since heard from time talk and they have decided to credit me back the £_00 because as they admitted their salesperson had made a mistake in allowing me to believe they would simply pay back the breakage fee .
neutral	so on this basis they have started to go up in my estimation .
neutral	the major_issue i have with the best_western booking on line service , is that i have to re enter my details every time i book a hotel !
neutral	this is particularly annoying when i have just booked one hotel and have to book another one immediately after .
neutral	i have to re enter all my details .
neutral	it would be very good just to have a log in where all my details are kept and if re booking another hotel at the same time i do not need to enter my details again .
neutral	when contacting best_western by phone , the service is excellent .
neutral	although the service is good for certain products i have had several issues with products that were passed the sold by date or very close to it .
neutral	i also had some mouldy products such nan breads .
neutral	would not recommend purchasing anything that could go bad and stick to safe products that can '_t go bad .
neutral	was printing a postcard which had a red border around the outside , and image bleeding to the edge of the card outside that .
neutral	this was carefully aligned to be inside the crop / bleed area on screen , and all looked fine on the preview .
neutral	the printed item , however , came close cropped to the red border on one of the four sides , looking very odd .
neutral	after e_- mailing customer_services they re - printed the cards , but they then came cropped to one of the other sides - still not quite what was shown on the preview .
neutral	the quality is great , but the on - screen preview is not quite what you receive .
neutral	as long as you recognise that , it '_s fine .
neutral	if you want a customer to post a review now , and dont pay for trust_pilot , then that customer must pre_- register or be prepared to use their facebook account .
neutral	many of my customers are not happy to do this , so may have to look at dropping trust_pilot as a preferred review site .
neutral	its not that it is expensive , but i dont like being held to ransom .
neutral	to make it hard for customers to place a review really goes against what i feel a review site should be doing .
neutral	please make it easier for customers to post reviews and then maybe i would be happy to sign up for additonal services .
neutral	although the product on average is slightly_cheaper_than other_sites , i was not impressed that it took over two_weeks to arrive .
neutral	other_companies have a much_quicker turn_around .
neutral	service was ok . couldn_'_t advise delivery time .
neutral	only deliver once a week on a saturday .
neutral	not the best tbh .
neutral	didn_'_t install it as website advised .
neutral	best advertised price for what we wanted but an additional compulsory booking_fee of £ 0 . 00 when you get to the end of the process makes it not quite as good as the ad !
neutral	we have gone with it this time but will be wary next time !
neutral	i was very happy with the service at glasses_direct but i was u happy with the quality of the product .
neutral	i paid extra for the extra think lenses and when they arrived , they were identical to the standard lenses i had in both my other pairs of glasses .
neutral	they appeared to be strandard thickness
neutral	the message i wrote online was not written in the card , so my girlfriend received a blank card thrown in the bottom of the box with the flowers 😠
neutral	flowers were nice and delivered on time a *
neutral	was happy with product .
neutral	but when item arrived , it was in an unsealed box .
neutral	a seal was not broken , as there was no evidence of a seal being there in the first place .
neutral	so free for anyone to have a look what '_s inside .
neutral	also the box was damaged , it had been squashed but this may have been responsibility of the courier .
neutral	easy to use , flowers did not look as good as picture ,, delivery expensive
neutral	i quite liked the product , cushion looking great but big fold marks through the middle of the face and prime areas of photos spoiled the look of it .
neutral	vacuum tight packaging causes the cushion to shrink and leaving unsightly permanent fold marks ( especially in prime areas of photos ) which unfortunately reduces its quality .
neutral	i am unhappy with both cushions i received .
neutral	suggests review your vacuum tight packaging process to direct fold marks towards four sides or some other way to avoid such marks .
neutral	i placed my order on 0th_march 00 at 00 :_00am , it got despatched the same day as i got an email at 00 :_00pm telling_me .
neutral	i am still_waiting to receive my order and it will be the 00th_march 00 tomorrow and it was only supposed to take 0 - 0 days .
neutral	also they do not give you any information on who is going to deliver your package or on what type of postage they have sent it by .
neutral	service was good , but very expensive
neutral	autoglass really messed me around with the booking to fit a replacement screen after they were unable to repair my windscreen ( a small " star " crack in my windscreen caused_by a stone ).
neutral	the replacement screen was booked to be fitted at feltham as i was told by the technician who visited my home that it was a complex job ( my car is a convertible ) and it was " better " to have it done at their centre .
neutral	i took his advice and got booked into my nearest_branch ( feltham ).
neutral	i had to wait 0weeks for an appointment and on the morning whilst i was driving there to leave the car , i got an email from autoglass to tell me the booking had been " upgraded " and now would be done on a home visit !!!
neutral	when i got to the branch , it took some time to resolve this confusion as " they do not make the bookings ".
neutral	so lots of wasted time and irritation - plus a loss of confidence in what autoglass had advised me .
neutral	the ' one way fee ' is a rip_off , doubled the price of my original quote .
neutral	will use different mode of transport in future .
neutral	not just rentalcars fault , it seems to be a fixed cartel price through the dealers .
neutral	awaiting responce as too why incorrect part sent , as i have ordered original fast flow electronic fuel sensor with wiring and reserve indicator for speedo , i hope correct_part comes this time , plus i require a diagram of installation as nothing with part number :_0000000 had none ,
neutral	how do i return item for refund as not understanding return form , do i have to give bank details , do i have to pay for postage ,
neutral	i have never had this problem with ordering before , otherwise i would have given a five_star_rating , as your service is excellent
neutral	yours_sincerely

neutral	customer code 00000 00 - 00 - 0000
neutral	i received my items speedily enough unfortunately the bow_ties were extremely poor quality and one arrived dirty .
neutral	the original transaction was conducted through paypal and for no reason was reversed with no contact or information .
neutral	it took two_weeks to get money back to be able to order again .
neutral	the product itself when it finally arrived was fine .
neutral	a very messy process .
neutral	obviously something needs sorting_out somewhere .
neutral	will make me think_twice before using again .
neutral	i usually use a rival string company but decided to try string direct because of the competitive_prices , however i received the wrong set of strings which arrived on time but meant i had to do my session with old strings until the right ones arrived 0 days_later .
neutral	hopefully this is only a minor_blip from an otherwise reputable_company
neutral	arrived at the airport and followed the email instruction to find that the parking_area was a building site !!!
neutral	progressed to the departures drop_off point and pulled over wondering where we had gone_wrong .
neutral	following a quick dash into the terminal followed_by a sprint around the carpark to find an attendant , we found that the instructions were wrong and we had to loop back around and turn left not right as originally instructed .
neutral	why oh why weren_'_t the instructions updated ?
neutral	anyway , following a stressfull start we had a great holiday and no_problems on return .
neutral	on this occasion the flowers were not up to your usual standard , mainly_because they opened the same day and did not last more than a few_days .
neutral	i ordered a brooks saddle .
neutral	the price was extrememly competitive and it was showing as in stock , however a couple of days after ordering it i received an email_saying that it was out of stock and they were waiting for their suppliers to provide it .
neutral	i subsequently received a call from the shop saying that there had been a delay at the suppliers and they expected the stock " imminently " ( though i give them credit for getting in touch ).
neutral	after two_weeks of waiting , i decided to reclaim my money via_paypal and entered a case against tredz , following which i received an email again saying the item was expected imminently and i received it 0 days after that .
neutral	to be fair to them , the item was as_described and the price was great , but i am not sure i would use them again as there are a lot of internet traders out there providing better service .
neutral	disappointed with flowers as was expecting a bunch from a florist not a supermarket bunch .
neutral	they were wrapped in a cellophane just like from a supermarket .
neutral	flowers were nice with a good amount .
neutral	flowers was not as shown on internet when inquired why told due to price delivery not included in price but i paid £ 0 . 00 for delivery won_'_t use you again
neutral	the baby car_seat to hire from gold car was 00_euros and not 00 as argus describes in their documents .
neutral	the glasses were qwuite easy to order , came quickly and were cheap .
neutral	however i think i got the distance beteen my pupils wrong and this limits the use of the glasses .
neutral	the instructions did make clear the need to get this right but getting someone_else to make the judgement millimetre prefect is i think unrealistic
neutral	i wrote a detailed and thoughtful review .
neutral	i was then asked to confirm by email or facebook .
neutral	this shouldn_'_t be necessary at all if i click on an invitation to review email .
neutral	i entered the email and password i had used with the supplier but this was not accepted .
neutral	i had no choice but to ' verify with facebook ' or abandon teh review .
neutral	luckily i do have a fb account or i '; d have been stuck .
neutral	however , i don_'_t want anything posted on my fb_page or anything notified to friends which you try and sneak through .
neutral	the price and service of the car_rental was excellent .
neutral	however our credit caed was copied and used to purchase goods whilst we were in south_africa and the car_rental company was the only place to have our details .
neutral	i '_m not 000_% happy as yet .
neutral	tried to buy the bbq in store but although it said they had 0 in stock they didn_'_t have any except the 0 on show .
neutral	so decided to order on line and as yet have had nothing back to say when the item is likely to be delivered .
neutral	so i '_m_sure you will understand_why i '_m not 000_% satisfied . i would be grateful for any information as to the whereabouts of my order .
neutral	while in the store last friday00th i asked if it would be possible to purchase the 0 on show as the label said " take home today " and was told no .
neutral	rang to place order , waited 00_minutes on the phone listening to that aweful music they play , this was the only bad thing , other than that it was a good experience .
neutral	the delivery is fast :)
neutral	dear dfds ,
neutral	i booked our recent_trip to europe , dover to calais , return , out on 00 / 0 / 00 and returning on the 00 / 0 / 00 .
neutral	this was our second trip with dfds , the last being september last_year !
neutral	i experienced a lot of difficulty in trying to make this booking , so employed the help of my son , who is something of an expert with all things it .
neutral	we couldn_'_t understand_why we got so much difficulty with this booking .
neutral	i use the internet all the time and make purchases on line on a regular_basis , but this was almost a painful experience .
neutral	it was most certainly that , when we returned to calais for our expected 0 . 00pm sailing , only to be told that , we should have sailed at 0 . 00am . i would not have intentionally booked 0 . 00am return , as we wouldn_'_t have been able to make that time in the 0st place .
neutral	i was absolutely shocked to then be told i had to pay £_00 . 00 for the single return_journey , which is some £_00 . 00 more than the whole return fare cost in the 0st place , not exactly the best way of treating a retuning customer , i . e ., repeat_business .
neutral	and all that given that the ferry was far from reaching load apacity
neutral	i would hope that dfds can make good on this , so that i would have the desire to return as a loyal_customer , especially as i plan on visiting europe on the regular_basis in the future .
neutral	regards
neutral	tim cummins
neutral	stayed in two_days no delivery of bedhead
neutral	i am a photographer who has used the same printer for years .
neutral	a friend of mine wanted one of my photos on a large square canvas , but wanted it on a budget .
neutral	i searched for an_alternative printer who offered a lower price and found orbit_print so gave them a try .
neutral	uploading / configuring the canvas was straight_forward and the economy delivery arrived in 0 days - all good to this point .
neutral	when the canvas arrived and was unpacked i immediately noticed a crease in the canvas which appears to have been there prior to the canvas being framed .
neutral	also there was a large dirty_mark on the fabric , possibly where it had been handled during manufacture .
neutral	i emailed orbit_print and got a prompt response telling_me that they would try to resolve the problems for me .
neutral	unfortunately i chose to use the courier firm collect_+ to return the canvas who have managed to lose it in transit !
neutral	i have no doubts that orbit_print would have rectified these issues had they received the canvas back - but unfortunately i can '_t provide feedback on this .
neutral	however it was disappointing that the canvas was allowed to leave in this condition , but these things_happen i guess .
neutral	thanks to geraint for keeping in touch .
neutral	flowers withered buy ok , but delivery service much to be desired , i was advised the flowers where on there way at 00 ; 00 in the morning , finally arrived on my door_step at 0 ; 00 at night .
neutral	would not recommend , and will not be using this company again .
neutral	i loved the blinds but unfortunately when the package arrived it looked like it was stomped on and kicked around by the couriers .
neutral	the box even had foot prints all over it .
neutral	my colleagues at work found it funny but i didnt .
neutral	i opened the package up and the blind casing was bent and dented and the edges of the wooden_blinds were scuffed in a couple of places .
neutral	unfortunately i just could not afford to send it back and wait for another week for a replacement as it was urgently_needed so i straightened it up and installed it .
neutral	all this could have been avoided if it was packaged more robustly .
neutral	we get deliveries at work all the time and i just can not get over how couriers abuse , kick and throw packages around right in front of me .
neutral	it '_s almost like they ' re angry at their employers because they ' re forced to work for a living ?
neutral	more robust_packaging needed !
neutral	i consider all was good , even i make a upgrade of truck but the carpet and the third row of seats was really dirty .
neutral	ordering was easy and arrived early_afternoon .
neutral	the flowers were as shown but the roses looked a little jadded and have stared to wilt quite badly after just two_days .
neutral	the hut is a great site for dvd '_s and music etc but their clothing range is poor quality .
neutral	i have had a couple of t - shirts which are thin and cheap looking , no real problem until i bought a wool , hooded cardie .
neutral	there was a dropped stitch in the seem which was entirely visible .
neutral	rather_than go through the hassle of returning the cardie , my mum is a first_class knitter and she repaired it for me .
neutral	so to dum up , the hut remains a good online store for dvds but its clothing quality is to be avoided .
neutral	finding , selecting and ordering easy .
neutral	received confirmation_email quickly which said would be available next_day ( saturday ) after noon .
neutral	i arrived at designated store around 0 : 00 to be told they hadn_'_t received the delivery .
neutral	i collected the item on the following_tuesday .
neutral	whilst the online booking experience was fine and in general the delivery service was ok , it '_s a little annoying that the booking system promised something that couldn_'_t be delivered .
neutral	some kind of adjustment needs to be done to avoid this sort of things happening .
neutral	ok experience .
neutral	pricey surcharge on credit_card
neutral	i '_ll start by saying i used too give ebuyer 0_stars , they have competitive_pricing .
neutral	but after their change to yodel i had to use another supplier as yodel are hit and miss at best .
neutral	i have edited this reply and upgraded my original rating from 0 to 0 as the rma has now been dealt_with ,
neutral	however until a choice of couriers is available i can not really recommend due to only using yodel .
neutral	excellent price , tyre_fitting just around corner , went in morning to book in for afternoon .
neutral	was told they could do it now so left car .
neutral	phoned ten_minutes later by tyre_shopper checking size of tyres ( good comms ) then nevr heard_anything until afternoon when i phoned them to ask where car was .
neutral	they said they didnt have the right tyre and where waiting for two to arrive by taxi .
neutral	why wasnt i told this it would have saved me waiting all day by the phone not good enough
neutral	i have booked to have 0 tyres changed .
neutral	the process was simple and quick .
neutral	the booking is for next week so i can '_t comment on service yet .
neutral	one thing i will be watching out for is the charge on my credit_card .
neutral	where i '_ve booked for mot '_s in the past i have been charged_twice and this has happened more than once !
neutral	- getting my money back was easy , but i ' d rather i didn_'_t have to go through the process !
neutral	holiday_lettings have improved their web_site and tools for advertisers making life_easier , however they fall down by not having a dedicated telephone_number to advertisers who are having issues as i did recently which was not resolved and led to me losing the booking .
neutral	so very poor on resolving issues as you are directed to their help section on the web_site but if you cant find the answer there you will have a very hard time getting to speak with anyone , this is very frustrating .
neutral	everything else has_improved , if they can resolve the issue stated they would get 0_stars , however only 0 due to this important failing .
neutral	regards
neutral	neil
neutral	owner
neutral	i '_ve_used as before and always been impressed .
neutral	the website as usual is easy to use and easy to find what i want .
neutral	the disappointment this time is delivery though .
neutral	ordered the product on monday and i '_m still_waiting come saturday .
neutral	previous experience has always been better .
neutral	argos is alright , but not my favourite .
neutral	i have bought 0 or 0 good things from there , but not all of them are up to scratch .
neutral	i bought a wath from there and i took it back because it kept loosing time .
neutral	so they replaced it with an identical one , but that kept loosing time aswell .
neutral	it '_s unexceptable0
neutral	i am determined to persist with global as i '_ve been to their store and staff there are the most helpful i have come_across .
neutral	however , this is my first online purchase from them and it took a week for delivery when the website indicated it was in stock and i could have had next_day delivery elsewhere and only paid 0p more .
neutral	out of stock but still advertise .
neutral	order on line go to store to collect and not arrived .
neutral	no " sorry " just come_back tomorrow .
neutral	ebay is being used more and more by company '_s which i think spoils the site .
neutral	should be used by the general_public to sell used products .
neutral	ebay is very bias towards buyers and ignore the terms and conditions of the seller .
neutral	i tend to use ebid and declampe more often now .
neutral	origin ii s0 stand excellent but wasn_'_t delivered next_day so wasted a day off work waiting for it .
neutral	it actually arrived a day later .
neutral	i was disappointed with the lack of detail on your website on the trousers i recently_purchased .
neutral	they arrived with a super slim label on them and were advertised on the website as slim_fit .
neutral	i felt that paying to return the trousers was unfair as many other online shops its free returns and i felt urban_industry were partly_responsible for the trousers not being what i expected
neutral	i found animeddirect while doing my regular search for worm and flea_treatments for my dogs .
neutral	animeddirect worked out cheaper .
neutral	i placed my first order and received the goods by dhl courier here in ireland .
neutral	the small complaint i have is that i couldn_'_t track the product when it arrived in ireland .
neutral	i had to ring team c courier in the uk who told me for this package they were using dhl but this may change .
neutral	through email , customer service in animedirect couldn_'_t provide me any information and they said they couldn_'_t get in touch with the courier .
neutral	( i did !)
neutral	what is the point in using a courier if i can '_t track ?
neutral	that means in the future i may have to wait ( which i expect and don_'_t mind ) but how do i know which day ?
neutral	i have since placed a 0nd order , mainly_due to the lower prices .
neutral	but if there is more hassle with couriers , i might go back to my usual online website .
neutral	i managed to write about five reviews the first time without a problem . there is nothing wrong with my computer but ever_since i click on the review button for various companies it just states done . the response to my emails to support endlessly states ` can you copy and paste the urls in to an email and send it to us ?
neutral	the range of products has always been good compared to other supermarkets . average fruit and vegetable section not as good as morrisons . very good wine section .
neutral	they are let_down by careless home delivery staff who clog the aisles with large trolleys chatting and poor responses to comments .
neutral	verbatim - ' in exactly the same words as were used originally '
neutral	or , if you are placing a transcription order with rev . com and paying for the additional verbatim option , the definition magically becomes ' conveying the general meaning , or ' gist ', in one '_s own words , depending on the transcriptionist .
neutral	$_000 down the drain , and i am going to be fixing this nightmare for the next 0 days .
neutral	tune up is one of the finest product ... no it '_s the one and the only one i might use and trust to tuneup my pc and that unquestionable fact for me .
neutral	unfortunattly moment '_s after purchasing the product with a general offer in the website ( 00 . 00 $), two new offers in row appear to me first through the uninstall with ( 00 . 00 $) which was oky for me not that far from what i '_ve paid but then after i installing the new version i had another offer for ( 00 . 00 $).
neutral	that was totally unaccepted .
neutral	loved the car , the prices and the overall package .
neutral	however pick_up was appalling - it took nearly as long to get the vehicle as it did to fly from the uk to majorca - literally .
neutral	for the people behind us in the long_queue it took longer .
neutral	they knew how many people had booked , when they were arriving and which cars were needed , yet there were not enough people to deal with this and to have to wait 0 hrs plus to pick_up your vehicle is not good practice .
neutral	i hope it is not usual .
neutral	ferry was comfortable and had good facilities .
neutral	the website booking information was confusing and lacked explanation of what is available eg .
neutral	travel from rotted to amsterdam , i only found out about return bus once i ' d landed by enquiring with ( dutch ) terminal staff .
neutral	i was preparing to travel by train .
neutral	also when first onboard there was no welcome or explanation of the ship facilities and events .
neutral	they don_'_t inform you that you have to buy insurance from budget car even if you buy from them so effectively i double bought insurace .
neutral	i placed 0 separate_orders recently with 0 different experiences .
neutral	on both_occasions i couldn_'_t find a cheaper price anywhere on the web .
neutral	on the first order i paid for next_day delivery but became concerned the next_day as hadn_'_t heard_anything about the delivery time .
neutral	i phoned to check all was ok and was told they were unable to locate the stock and that someone was supposed to have called me to let_me know .
neutral	i am a firm_believer that a company only shows its true quality in how it resolves issues when things go_wrong .
neutral	in this instance i received a sincere_apology and assurance that someone would be allocated to locating my item and i would get a call to confirm the anticipated delivery date .
neutral	sure_enough , i got a call back within 0mins .
neutral	i was advised they had found my jacket and were dispatching it the same day for delivery the following_day .
neutral	the item arrived as promised .
neutral	the only thing i would have changed would have been for them to offer some from of goodwill_gesture for the fact that i had taken a day off work for the original delivery .
neutral	so from an initially negative experience i was happy enough to give them another chance .
neutral	my second order went through perfectly .
neutral	cheapest price and free next_day delivery .
neutral	can '_t ask for much more .
neutral	i will use them again but another poor experience will be my last with this company .
neutral	price isnt everything !
neutral	the delivery was brilliant but i thought from the website that the parts were genuine_samsung and turned_out to be generic ( though still gaurenteed and further support offered should there be a problem )
neutral	i was pleased to be kept up to date with progress of order and for the one hour time_slot for delivery .
neutral	the courier pulled up outside , but didn_'_t even call , he just left the parcel at side of house because the note said to leave it there if no answer .
neutral	when i asked why he hadn_'_t called he said the bell wasn_'_t working , which was untrue .
neutral	( a knock would suffice ).
neutral	finally the order arrived with a garden fork with round tines instead of the flat tined version which was pictured on the screen and was the only reason i ordered it , i already have the fork which was sent .
neutral	easy process art from one thing .
neutral	i assumed the address_label which i received was the shipping label .
neutral	i used this and went to the sending location only to be told i needed he label with the barcode .
neutral	i called your service desk ( 000 number a bit off putting ) and was told the shipping label had been sent .
neutral	checking , it arrived while i was in transit .
neutral	recommend you do not send the address_label to avoid_confusion .
neutral	£_00 for a room , looks very good but parking and internet add £_00 per night so in reality it was £_00 per night , again not bad but this should be the advertized price
neutral	two failed deliveries .
neutral	i was in both_times .
neutral	in the end i had to get in touch with the delivery company .
neutral	i asked why they hadn_'_t rung me to find out where i was .
neutral	they replied that that had not been given my phone number by tyreleader .
neutral	i find this rather stupid .
neutral	i entered my number into the website so why didn_'_t they pass it on ?
neutral	got the tyres eventually .
neutral	also , payment was frustrating because it is not a uk company so my bank was very reluctant to process the payment and this took at_least 00_hours to sort_out .
neutral	other than this fine , and the price was good .
neutral	unfortunately they sent me the wrong trophy first off .
neutral	they were apologetic and got the right trophy to mean pretty quickly .
neutral	would use again
neutral	very easy to use but the bunch i picked at £_00 ended_up being £_00 .
neutral	i would have felt better if it just said what it is from the get go .
neutral	found the app booking process simple .
neutral	when i did have a problem online and called , the telesales were very efficient and friendly .
neutral	however , most companies are great at taking you money .
neutral	it '_s only when things go_wrong do you find out how good a company you ' re dealingnwith .
neutral	so , let '_s hope the holidays goes great and there have been no misrepresentations / issues etc .
neutral	then and only then , will i be able to properly give an accurate star_rating of this company .
neutral	i have ordered twice from sigma .
neutral	once it took about two_weeks and two e_mails before i got the delivery which was " in stock and despatched within 00_hours " apparently .
neutral	second time was excellent .
neutral	no_problems at all with the actual items when they came .
neutral	have been charged for using cash withdrawl in italy .
neutral	i thought all transactions were free .
neutral	awaiting reply from office .
neutral	i need a waistcoat for a special_occasion .
neutral	so i google ’ d what i wanted and the results included " my tuxedo ".
neutral	their website looked good and was very easy to use , so placed an order with them and paid on line - simple !
neutral	so_far , so good ; i received a few emails_telling of the progress and finally a very specific delivery window – 00 . 00 to 00 . 00 .
neutral	at 00 . 00 i received an email_telling_me that the driver had been unable to find anyone at the address given and was “ unable ” to make delivery .
neutral	this raises two points .
neutral	why , if the delivery window is an_hour did i receive an email 00_minutes into the window stating failed delivery ?
neutral	it was almost like the email had already been written in anticipation of a ‘ failed ’ delivery ...!
neutral	the second point is : we are a pub .
neutral	we are in the middle of a town by - passed by a duel carriageway ( a000 ).
neutral	we are a large half timbered tudor style build with two restaurants and a six letting rooms above ; drivers have to drive past us to travel through the village , and as the delivery driver is supposed to leave a card indicating that ‘ they had tried but failed to make delivery ’ and didn_’_t .
neutral	maybe they didn_’_t even try ?
neutral	after a call to my tuxedo to up - date them ; the parcel arrived via_royal_mail ’_s parcel_force the following_morning at about 00am .
neutral	great stuff !?
neutral	well no .
neutral	not really .
neutral	it was a day too late !
neutral	great customer service from my tuxedo and parcel_force ; ruined by interlink_express !
neutral	the booking process through looking0parking was quick and easy .
neutral	however , when i turned_up at the meet &_greet car_park at_stansted_airport , the staff couldn_'_t find my booking details neither under my name nor under looking0parking , and i was then asked if i am sure i booked m + g car_park stansted ...
neutral	luckily they then found my booking with my car_registration and i was allowed in .
neutral	great kit available on golfonline , easy ordering and quick dispatch .
neutral	however , interlink_express simply failed to deliver and sent me an email with the usual baloney that there was nobody in to collect the parcel .
neutral	this was despite someone specifically being there waiting for them .
neutral	so i had to waste my saturday_morning driving to their depot to collect it myself .
neutral	unfortunately , i have had to tell golfonline that i will not order from them again as long as they use that shower not to deliver their goods .
neutral	on a topical point , is this a good case in favour of royal_mail ?
neutral	better_than most of them but if you telephone them prepare to wait for an answer about 0 to 0 hours
neutral	paid for next_day delivery .
neutral	came 0 days_later
neutral	all on the title .
neutral	faultless service .
neutral	great product .
neutral	expensive administration .
neutral	couldn_'_t access policy and key facts from website .
neutral	had to be e_mailed to me .
neutral	had no incidents so no claim made
neutral	the service was well and truly sorted_out and the service was promt from your end the only delay was at this end we mislaid the phone
neutral	easy to book , on arival easy enough to find the long_stay_parking location , very difficult to identify the exact location of ones car on return .
neutral	i was really hoping to use these pens for gifts and advertisement for our new church .
neutral	however the all black pens really just dont stand out .
neutral	.
neutral	i have pearl_izumi and i have cycleclothinguk .
neutral	both last about the same time after fading from sweat and sunlight .
neutral	as long as ccuk keep their prices low they are worth buying .
neutral	of course the better brands are hyped more and arguably better made , but in everyday hard use and daily washing neither are going to last more than a year .
neutral	i have been perfectly happy with ccuk clothing - but i '_m a cyclist who_enjoys cycling - not modelling keep_up with the jones ' gear junkie .
neutral	andrews office_furniture sells second - hand or ex - display officer furniture .
neutral	well_worth a visit if you are on a budget .
neutral	i bought a herman - miller chair for half the new price !
neutral	no problem with the chinese made products but having purchased a number of
neutral	them at full price a few weeks_ago am now disappointed to see the later heavily
neutral	discounted prices for the same items !
neutral	!
neutral	i understnd the desire to maximise sales in the run up to christmas but perhaps
neutral	previous_purchasers of substance could be awarded a voucher against the purchase
neutral	of future products as some compensation for their extra_expense
neutral	buying stuff - always seems to be ok - cheap and nasty phone covers or screen_protectors etc_etc - selling is and can be very annoying - being cheated out of cash because the buyer isnbt verified or card fraud !
neutral	grrr
neutral	that aside it is what it is and ebay do the online car boot fair better_than anyone_else !
neutral	well made product the only thing is bit_tight on thighs and very long not just over knee but more like just above foot but otherwise ok , just hope don_'_t tear when cycling quite tight on thigh
neutral	well i ordered this item and it has taken over 0_weeks to not get here .
neutral	i contacted twice and explained i needed it for tuesday and was told to hang on til monday lunch to see if it arrived .
neutral	blatantly won_'_t arrive for 00th_birthday
neutral	excellent value , would be a 0_star_rating but for them sending only half the order .
neutral	after a few emails to and thro the rest of the order eventually arrived .
neutral	would still use them again .
neutral	having missed the courrier on their first visit i was rather taken_aback by the tone of the e_- mail_advising me that they would make a second_attempt the next_day and if i missed that then there would be an extra_charge of £ 0 . 00 !
neutral	a new one on me from any on - line supplier .
neutral	reasonable prices given on the items accepted but a very limited range of titles were accepted ( entered about 000 books - only about 00_% were accepted ).
neutral	seemed to be a higher hit rate with dvds rather_than books .
neutral	main problem came when they sent me my receipt , and 0 items had gone_missing .
neutral	ziffit claimed to have not received these , even_though they had all been sent in the same parcel ( checked and double - checked by myself and my wife before sending ).
neutral	i can only_assume that these items were lost at ziffit '_s end .
neutral	after a succession of emails requesting that this was investigated they did finally agree to pay me for the items anyway .
neutral	unfortunately i bought 0 different keys and none of them fit .
neutral	i was pulled into facebook by an email from someone_who wanted me to be his ' friend '.
neutral	he was already my friend , so i had no idea what he was going on about , however i followed the link , intending to give him some click to confirm rather_than ignore him , but found i actually had to join the thing to do so .
neutral	i was tempted to phone him to say ' nothing personal , but you ' re going to have to accept that i am your friend , without my having to join some official club in order to prove it to you '.
neutral	however , i decided to join , in the unlikely_event that it might be in any way of interest to me .
neutral	that seemed to put me on some kind of a map , and i was soon getting emails from more people wanting me to be their ' friend '.
neutral	each time , i had to find and apply my login_details in order to validate the friendship i thought they already had with me .
neutral	after a few_months , these interruptions began to dwindle , and i only have to log in about once every three_months .
neutral	occasionally , i am told that people have ' written things on my wall ', so i log in .
neutral	it is a lot of effort to do things which can more easily be done by phone , email or forum .
neutral	worse still , i seem to be in the centre of irrelevant , even idiotic information trying to grap my attention of my clicks .
neutral	somebody was desperate to get a virtual ingredient to make a virtual cocktail in order to get a virtual - bartenders ' certificate .
neutral	what collyrot !
neutral	but i wincingly and , i admit , patronizingly decided to click to assist them in their pointless ambition ; and found that to do so , i had to liberate my entire address book to the organizers of the virtual bar , presumably so that i become implicated in spreading this .
neutral	therefore , i go on facebook only when i am called , am unimpressed each time , and i log off asap .
neutral	there are , however , many millions of people who like spending time on it - it obviously ' works '.
neutral	even some of my real - life friends tell me that it helps them to ' keep in touch '.
neutral	when reviewing , i typically feel secure and confident that i am assessing the quality of a ' thing in itself '.
neutral	but , regarding facebook , i realise i am reviewing a product which works , but which i have no interest in , like a chicken - sexing kit .
neutral	the serious difference_between facebook and chicken - sexing kits , both fo which , i assume , achieve their objectives , is that the latter does not force itself into my awareness , nor recruit my friends to be part of its marketing .
neutral	product is great .
neutral	mixes_well and tastes good .
neutral	dissapointed with the delivery as i payed for next_day and it didn_'_t come for 0 days .
neutral	this should be improved .
neutral	pleased with free stuff for 0st time .
neutral	new shaker makes_life easy .
neutral	thanks .
neutral	i amsure i will be happy with the product when i receive it ( or rather my granddaughter will be ).
neutral	i am not so happy to have received your email today telling_me that if i had delayed placing my order until this week i would have received a 00_% discout !
neutral	mazuma_mobile claims to give you money for your old phone .
neutral	they do that - the next business day if after you post it ( for free ) to them .
neutral	however , if my old phone was in a better condition ( without the slight_scratches and beer stains ) i wouldn_'_t think_twice about putting it on ebay or something similar as a used phone .
neutral	the phone i gave mm was a nokia_e00 in " good " condition , but not " good " condition that i ' d feel_comfortable selling to someone i knew .
neutral	the phone was worth £_000 , i got £_00 .
neutral	fair deal ?
neutral	maybe in this case judging_by the hidden problems with the phone , but mazuma never asked about them .
neutral	in a nutshell , if you have a good quality new - ish phone that your contract has made obsolete , you '_ll be able to get a few_quid for it on mm with no questions_asked ( doesn_'_t matter about the scratches or the fact that it '_s been in a pint of beer ).
neutral	but if you were to put the phone on ebay , you ' d get a lot more money .
neutral	prices are quite competitive , but limited_availability of the most_popular_sizes , especially for attractively_priced items .
neutral	got child item once instead of an adult one .
neutral	return procedure is , in my view , artificially difficult .
neutral	therefore , unless you are sure about item size & quality and fit - do not buy there .
neutral	i got no response from the customer service on their website .
neutral	this led to a delivery not being cancelled as requested .
neutral	however , once i did get hold of a person ( via the company twitter ) they were very helpful and gave_me a full_refund .
neutral	0 .
neutral	i have no problem with my order which was delivered on the day promised .
neutral	but i would have liked to have had at_least an option for a morning or an afternoon delivery time as having to stay at home for a whole day does restrict the customer and detract_from the customer experience .
neutral	other carriers will give a two hour delivery window which should be possible with a little planning .
neutral	0 .
neutral	i would have liked to go to my local_store to collect this item but as they didnt have it in stock and nor did any of the stores within 00 miles or so of me .
neutral	i would have thought that like some other stores ( e . g .
neutral	currys ) i could have ordered an item and had it delivered to my local homebase for me to collect .
neutral	maaybe it '_s something that homebase should be thinking_about .
neutral	tried to pay online but the form would not accept my postcode as they wanted a zip code format .
neutral	i then tried to phone but unable to get through because they were so busy .
neutral	i asked them to call me which they did .
neutral	a shame as the glasses were good value but it seems the company is expanding beyond its handling capacity
neutral	the flowers were lovley and arrived the next_morning ( i had only ordered them tea time the night before ) i was pleased with the contact i had when they was being delivered although i was dissapointed as i had paid extra for a bigger bouqet and they were smaller than an average size in my opinion therefore i did not think they were worth the money i had paid although my mum was very pleased with them .
neutral	i '_ve been an orange customer for years - i '_ve had all_sorts of problems from niggles with rude customer service to being_overcharged by £_000 .
neutral	they make it as difficult as possible to complain and when you do , it '_s unlikely you '_ll receive a response .
neutral	yet i get a reasonably good deal and when someone calls me , my phone rings - which is what i want from a mobile provider .
neutral	it '_s a sad state of affairs that i fear orange are amongst the better networks for customer service , so i '_m happy enough where i am .
neutral	the service was ok apart_from the fact they didn_'_t make the process of how to redeem the game clear on their website .
neutral	i got a key for blood dragon , uplay version .
neutral	i tried to activate it through the uplay client and it wouldn_'_t work .
neutral	i eventually heard back from gk0 . me the next_day explaining that it was a promo_code which i had to use through the uplay website in my browser , as if i was trying to purchase the game .
neutral	rather_than just straight activate it through the client .
neutral	just wish they ' d made this info clearer on their site to begin with .
neutral	could '_ve been playing this game last night when i really wanted to .
neutral	but other than that , they did ok .
neutral	had some issues with this store .
neutral	there were many failed_attempts at getting the problem sorted and i got ignored a lot in the process .
neutral	but after 0 months it finally gets sorted_out .
neutral	i do appreciate the resolution to the problem , but it '_s a shame it took so long to sort_out .
neutral	also the fact that customer service kept ignoring my emails was really frustrating .
neutral	giving a 0_star_review on here sorted my problem out almost_instantly .
neutral	but 0 months of speaking to customer service did almost nothing .
neutral	maybe i wont_bother with customer service next time !
neutral	it '_s only a propelling pencil .
neutral	i '_t s less_than £ 0 .
neutral	after more than a week overdue it hadn_'_t arrived .
neutral	emails and phone_calls not responded to .
neutral	eventually i managed to make contact and all was resolved_amicably and in a friendly way .
neutral	they refunded the cost - which was nice - and sent the pencil anyway .
neutral	once we ' d established comms i was told they had email and hosting problems .
neutral	satisfactory_outcome .
neutral	very informated to us
neutral	instant , easily but not so completed collection
neutral	used to shop with play . com regularly but they '_ve now introduced postal_charges options ( free_postage takes longer now ).
neutral	prices seem to have increased and no_longer beat other online_retailers ( often more_expensive ).
neutral	they only have occasional good deals now ... such a shame !
neutral	had some good & some bad_experiences .
neutral	no_problems with delivery - drivers always pleasant and helpful .
neutral	problems with wrong_size items being picked , smaller packs than oedered but charged for larger .
neutral	no free phone customer_services so have had to hunt for their online customer service - did finally get some money refunded but they didn_'_t apologize , just tried to make excuses !
neutral	have to be very careful checking prices on their website as i '_ve found lots of advertised " special_offers " which work out more_expensive than buying another size of same product , also they tend to change the way price is shown on different_sizes of same product ie .
neutral	per_kg , per 000g , per pack etc
neutral	been with o0 for a quite a few_years_now ( mobile_phone & broadband ).
neutral	have had really good experience with broadband support when needed but recently have found their prices increasing making them the most expensive of the popular providers rather_than the value provider they used to be .
neutral	have used ebay for years and have got some good bargains .
neutral	recently i '_ve found many sellers charging more for items to cover the incresed fees and often going directly to sellers website is cheaper , or find things much_cheaper_elsewhere .
neutral	don_'_t sell much these days as a hearty 00_% is lost with ebay + paypal combined fees .
neutral	good for some products but found some items were cheaper in high_street_shops after buying at what claimed to be hugely_discounted prices !
neutral	i only use this site occasionally after checking prices thoroughly and only if items meet the £_00 min spend for free delivery otherwise it '_s pointless !
neutral	still_waiting for email confirmation
neutral	car_hire was ok but there was the usual " pat for a full_tank of fuel and bring the car back empty " which is impossible , in my case my usual hire_period is for a just over a week and only ever use no more than 0 / 0 of a tank ,
neutral	at the initial hire stage it states " collision_damage_waiver ", read the details and it , s not quite what you get , when questioning this at the pick_up desk l am told that in the event of an accident the cover only applies to body damage , wheels tyres windows and fittings are not covered which implies it would have to be a unique accident , another catch to wangle more money .
neutral	just returned from a 0month trip around singapore , australia , new_zealand and thailand , one of the legs from sydney to bangkok was on ba00 , and i must_say that the service on business class is not what it used to be .
neutral	the service was some what rushed and we got the feeling that we an inconvenience to the cabin_crew , they would have been happier if the business class cabin would have been empty .
neutral	come on ba get your act_together , i am_afraid that qantas really have the better customer service than you at the moment .
neutral	i think the website is pretty good .
neutral	it offered up a cheaper alternative for the remote_control that i was viewing .
neutral	however , it did not point out the differences_between two remotes with the same number , and i inevitably ordered the wrong one .
neutral	i '_ve received some excellent customer service from sebastian , who has guided_me through the process of getting a replacement .
neutral	as i said , we '_ll wait and see .
neutral	the whole purchasing process is easy .
neutral	product easily_assembled - no issues .
neutral	it '_s a comfy office_chair which matches the good '_s description .
neutral	office_furniture online '_s ( ofo ) problem is that they have contracted with city_link as a delivery partner .
neutral	city_link offer a tracking service which doesn_'_t track ; an email service to inform when a parcel will arrive ( estimated ) 0000 - 0000hrs sounds accurate - unfortunately they didn_'_t deliver at all and didn_'_t bother to inform the customer ; and a ' respond to complaints within 00_hours ' - no response as yet .
neutral	next_day , 0000hrs , city_link '_s website again informed me that delivery would take place 0000 - 0000hrs this then changed , without_any attempt to notify the customer , to 0000 - 0000hrs - bit late if you ' d planned your day .
neutral	city_link finally delivered nearly an_hour late .
neutral	at_0000hrs city_link inform_me that my parcel would be delivered between 00 and 000 minutes earlier_than the time stamp of the email - good effort !!
neutral	!
neutral	ofo - change your delivery partner or risk_losing business !
neutral	!
neutral	if the item you want is out of stock , but there is a due date on the website , don_'_t believe that is when you will receive your order .
neutral	it is just the date of the next delivery to speed_graphic and they may not get enough stock to fulfill your order .
neutral	they need to buck up their ideas and improve customer service .
neutral	how difficult is it to say that only 00 will be delivered and that 00 will need to be delivered before you get your order and this may be several weeks down the line .
neutral	competition is tough so they should be making_sure that their customers are kept up to date about their order .
neutral	poor customer service almost inevitably leads to poor reputation and loss of custom .
neutral	i bought wirelless lan card for £_00 . 00
neutral	i found it online for £_00 .... service was ok just over priced !
neutral	i think the website booking_fees has to be cleared shown and not hidden in the taxes and fees , which are for government taxes , airport charges , airline charges
neutral	the ebookers service fee , which may be applicable , but seems to be always charged , should be indicated separately like the card charges .
neutral	i '_ve ordered 0 times through hungryhouse , and 0 times the food has arrived late .
neutral	not exactly_what they promise in the adverts !
neutral	i have bought from the happy_puzzle company for a number of years_now .
neutral	i am pleased with the products i have bought .
neutral	sadly they have let us down this last time by not having the goods in stock and despite giving 0_weeks notice of our order only promising to deliver well after i need them .
neutral	i '_m finding that i have to open cases all the time and companies are declining cashback for no reason yet are still being allowed to be on the site when they are cleary at it .
neutral	customer service ignore your questions too .
neutral	interparcel used to be the cheapest for ups ( pretty_much the only service we use - they actually turn_up and do not damage our goods :) but now they are hammered on price by p0g 00_% of the time .
neutral	ui issues just seem to be ignored :
neutral	0 .
neutral	why do i have to type in the county ?
neutral	what a waste of millions of peoples time - surely the postcode does this .
neutral	0 .
neutral	i want to enter the recipient email address so they get notification at each_stage of the shipment .
neutral	do not try and fob me off with sms - we demand email !
neutral	0 .
neutral	payment options are still clunky .
neutral	used travelup because they had the lowest_price and the site was easily to use - found via skyscanner .
neutral	however the true level of customer service cannot be fully assessed until after i have received my ticket and fly to my holiday destination and back .
neutral	my last order was about the sixth pallet of tiles i have had from this company .
neutral	generally i would say everything is very good and of course you can ’_t beat them on price .
neutral	but i will say that i have sent back a pallet of tiles before as they looked a mess on the lorry and they sent me back what must have been seconds as the tiles we warped .
neutral	this last pallet was a mess when it arrived as well .
neutral	but i was waiting on them so i accepted it .
neutral	it must have been packed by someone without a brain as the boxes were stacked upright and wrapped with a bit of clingfilm .
neutral	soon as the pallet gets knocked in transit they have all leaned forward ripping all the boxes and scratching some of the tiles .
neutral	it also made it a nightmare to unload without them toppling .
neutral	i must_say that i have used about a third of them and so_far only two have been broken .
neutral	the last problem was although i clicked the link on my previous order so as to get exactly the same tiles they are different .
neutral	not the same shade of white , not the same manufacturer and not even exactly the same size .
neutral	which meant i cannot mix them with my left over ’_s .
neutral	i booked a return flight and hotel but l later found out that the return flight duration from florence to london is 00_hrs rang opodo customer service and i was told that if i cancel my return flight the departing or outbound_flight will be cancelled also .
neutral	i was advised by customer service lady not cancel my return flight until after departure this l find absurd even_though i have bought another return ticket .
neutral	i cannot send a review as , solicitor not visiting until next monday .
neutral	what a selection .
neutral	never seen anything quite like it .
neutral	especially in the whisky category .
neutral	however , it does take them a few_days to even start packing your order which is slightly irritating .
neutral	same or next_day processing of your order would be much more helpful .
neutral	other_websites do this so why whisky_exchange doesn_'_t is deterring me from coming_back to them more ofter .
neutral	also , with the amount of times purchasing from them and the actual amount spent on their site it would make it much more_appealing to buy from them again if there was some kind of rewards_scheme like money off next order vouchers etc .
neutral	but there does not seem to be any insentive from them to do this .
neutral	apart_from that the selection is first_rate .
neutral	purchased some window rubbers and employed a glass fitting company to fit the windows with the rubbers from just_kampers .
neutral	the windows could not be fitted as the rubbers were too hard and not flexible enough so i sent them back as my cost and expained the situation .
neutral	the glass fitting company obtained some lenghts of rubber to fit the windows and fitted them no problem .
neutral	i was told by just_kampers that there was noting wrong with the rubbers i had sent back , but find it hard to believe that just_kampers have attempted to fit the rubbers to experience the difficulty in fitting them .
neutral	browsed online , ordered for my kid and items delivered with no_problems .
neutral	only_downside is that when i ordered there was no scope to use a cex credit voucher that i had after selling some goods at my local_store .
neutral	i also couldn_'_t order from my local_store to deliver there and use the voucher as cex stores are individual franchises .
neutral	trophies were good quality and good price paid extra for express delivery parcel left at wrong_address .
neutral	not trophy stores fault probably courier still poor to leave at wrong_address
neutral	clothes good shame you forgot about our order for a month
neutral	by the time they turned_up it was too warm to make good use of the fleeces
neutral	we stayed at villa san fernando in august_0000 .
neutral	the villa was spacious and the garden area was lovely as per previous reviews , however the villa could do with updating as it is somewhat tired inside , ( especially the kitchen area and bathrooms ).
neutral	the street on which the villa is located and immediate local area is not particularly attractive , due to a fair_amount of construction plots and graffiti on walls , however other nearby towns do make up for this .
neutral	( san pedro is a working town which would not be to everyone '_s taste as a holiday destination .
neutral	some parts are a bit shabby ).
neutral	that said the sea front area is lovely , although the stoney beach is not ideal for young_kids .
neutral	( go to el cristo beach , 00_mins drive away in estepona ).
neutral	we were disappointed not to see our rep 0 or 0 days into our stay and had to phone to get answers to our questions ; such as the best places to shop and beaches to visit etc .
neutral	it would have been nice to have had better info regarding these points from the start .
neutral	overall we did enjoy our stay , however there is definitely room for improvement .
neutral	the initial order worked well and i expected to receive the code within their stated 0 to 00_hours .
neutral	however after 00_hours i had to send an e_- mail asking for the code .
neutral	within a couple of hours fonesunlock sent the code to me and it worked with no_problems .
neutral	thanks
neutral	well i keep getting used to good ' ol facebook , then they go along & change it every few_months .
neutral	now we have timeline .
neutral	love it or hate it .
neutral	actually , i love it ~ but will it be around for long ?
neutral	who_knows ....
neutral	for about £_000 you can get yourself a tuxedo which is alright considering it is between £_00 and £_00 to hire .
neutral	seeing as this was my first_outing i did notice some tuxedos that looked much_better but they were probably also more_expensive .
neutral	if you are someone_who spends a lot of time wearing a tuxedo then spend some more money on something decent but if you are like me and need something for that very rare black_tie occasion then this will do .
neutral	oh , the shirt did start chafing my neck and nipples later on in the evening which wasn_'_t pleasant so will probably get a better quality shirt for next time .
neutral	just like the curate '_s egg , this experience was partly good and partly not so good .
neutral	the ordering_process was quick and efficient .
neutral	it was easy and enjoyable .
neutral	the bouquet was delivered promptly and by a courteous and cheerful courier .
neutral	however , when i sat in my lounge looking at the bouquet , i felt disappointed .
neutral	it had not been arranged very well , the flowers where not what i would call a0 in condition and i could not help wishing that i had just gone to a local_florist with £_00 as i feel i would have got a far better bouquet .
neutral	overall then : service - vey good !
neutral	value for money - disappointing .
neutral	envirofone bought my phone the only thing i had to wait along time for payment
neutral	i phoned kenable & specifically_asked for a dvi_cable to link 0 monitor to 0 computers since i was unable to see the required product on the webpage .
neutral	i was given a product ref which i then ordered which was not what i needed and thus useless .
neutral	however the error was quickly acknowledged & corrected
neutral	your web_site was easy to use and as we entered our party date we felt_assured that if there were any_issues with delivery you would call .
neutral	having not received anything by the morning of the party we logged on to the tracker to discover that the courier was claiming they had tried to deliver the goods twice and failed but left a card .
neutral	no such cards were left at all and i assume that due to extensive road works and a forway temporary traffic light system around our house that they never actually attempted the delivery .
neutral	wwhere the service fell down was that had i not have logged on to the tracker i would not have known .
neutral	i eventually had to drive to the depot to collect the goods .
neutral	surely the courier should have notified you that they could not complete the delivery ???
neutral	?
neutral	the only bad thing i will point out is when my son put the hat on over his face , its doesnt pull down and hold its shape it keeps curling back to the shape it has when in the packet .
neutral	:(
neutral	the bljnds i ordered arrived on time but not made as i ordered 0cm short in width and very long but i was able to use them after adjustments i should have checked them before hanging them
neutral	happy with the product when it arrived but feel company abuses pricing by pricing trophies low but then overloading the postage_costs .
neutral	it really doesnt cost £ 0 . 00 to post a small trophy !
neutral	very good service , had tracker to watch and track the delivery , only down_side , was they wasn_'_t the flowers i ordered via the internet
neutral	ordering and delivery experience was fine .
neutral	however , i couldn_'_t believe just how much cardboard and polystyrene is needed for 0 medium_sized pieces of furniture .
neutral	it required a 00 mile_round_trip , with a car full , to the tip to get_rid of it .
neutral	perhaps an unpacking service at the point of delivery would be useful ?
neutral	on my arrival to pick_up my rental car from the " goldcar " office in alicante spain ,... myself , and a lot of other " goldcar renters " were on two_minds as to which of the two queues one should join in order to pay , and make the initial car_hire transaction .
neutral	the confusion was the sign over one part of the office desk that stated in english and spanish ,... " cars without_reservation " together with ,..." express service " " priority check in ".
neutral	nobody , including myself , could understand what this meant , and like myself , many customers stood in the wrong que for a long time only to be told by the desk - keeper , to join the other queue , which was an abhorently long one , and like myself , everyone was angry and dismayed .
neutral	as for myself , i put it down to ; " typical spanish thinking " as i find the spanish way of doing things is a lot less_than exceptable in most_cases , they do not seem to understand that we , the customer are about to spend some time in their country , and about to spend some of our hard_earned_cash there , and would like to get some value / courtesy in exchange .
neutral	been with 0 for about 0 years_now , originally the signal_strength was excellent here in west cumbria , this was the main_reason that i sarted with the 0 network .
neutral	however over the last 0 - 0 months the reception has got to be more patchy , giving them 0 last chance as i have just taken out a new contract , then i may have to reconsider my options despite the excellent packages offered by this company .
neutral	code recieved within 00_hrs , there was a couple of steps missing on the instructions , but as there was a link to a video_tutorial that sorted the issue i had .
neutral	overall happy it worked phone is now unlocked
neutral	it '_s where i shop for protein , as their prices are great .
neutral	many of the items come with free_gifts such as protein shakers and tester packs .
neutral	delivery is also great .
neutral	in this area i ' d give them 0_stars .
neutral	however , be wary of some the marketing stuff they do , and things they put in the descriptions .
neutral	an example is something called methoxy - 0 - test which they claim boosts testosterone levels and recovery / performance .
neutral	i found zero evidence that it does this , and found a few scientific papers to the contrary .
neutral	however when asked about this i got no reply and my comments weren_'_t approved for the site .
neutral	there are other examples too .
neutral	basically , use it as a shop by all means , where you go to it knowing what you want .
neutral	i wouldn_'_t recommend going to it and trying to work out what you want , as they push certain products ( e . g .
neutral	phd supplements ) very hard , some of which have no evidence they do anything .
neutral	disappointed to find that the total_cost of the order is hidden until the last moment , feel_cheated the original flowers were £_00 . 00 + £ 0 . 00 postage = £_00 . 00
neutral	good price , good comms & fast delivery .
neutral	unfortunately when the item came there were 0 parts missing !
neutral	this didnt instill me with confidence .
neutral	i e_mailed company & they did e_mail back quickly to apologise .
neutral	im waiting for the missing parts to arrive & hopefully this was a genuine mistake .
neutral	but it does make me wonder_how a sealed item can be delivered & not be 000_%.
neutral	ordered 0gb_ram on the 00th midday .
neutral	paid for next_day delivery .
neutral	have still received nothing .
neutral	was assured by mr m that my parcel would be delivered today by 0pm .
neutral	i '_m still_waiting for it .
neutral	the courier company never pick_up their phone .
neutral	mr m not interested .
neutral	advise others not to shop_here when there are other_suppliers that go out of their way to provide the service their customers deserve .
neutral	i shall never use this company again
neutral	i would like to add that i have finally received my order and i have installed it and is working great .
neutral	mr_memory interceded and helped get my order to me on the 0rd_attempt and my next_day delivery premium was refunded .
neutral	i will give mr m another chance so i know i shall be shopping with them again as i love their products and the people there are great .
neutral	however , its a shame they may lose customers due to a poor courier service experience such as mine .
neutral	don_'_t like systems where a pick_up is involved however they came at a decent
neutral	time mid - morning so cant_complain overall i paid more than_anticipated .
neutral	so i had a couple bags of d - aa and along with that i got a free_sample of complete pre_- workout watermelon and instant bcaa .
neutral	with the d - aa , it isn_'_t easy to mix at all , i have stirred and used a shaker with this stuff and shaken it before use as advised and it still leaves what seems like a lot of the powder left at the bottom of the cup , this is annoying because it is consumed in 0 gram doses and missing a little matters a lot .
neutral	next , the pre_- workout .
neutral	tasted like water melon to an extent , it was bitter tasting and not very pleasant to drink at all and the effect was fast but not overly intense .
neutral	i have shopped at jules_b for over 00 years and took receipt of my recent order .
neutral	my overall feeling was disappointment some of the items arrived well_packaged and others did not , there was a feeling of inconsistency to how items are packaged both within the jules_b branches and also sent out when you purchase directly from a jules_b branch and from the online service .
neutral	for instance with this delivery the ties ordered was wrapped in tissue_paper whereas if you purchase from the stores they arrive in tie wallets to better protect them , the same experience with some of the other purchases such as the belts , where one looks_like the leather on this is damaged .
neutral	as i now live out of the north_east and do not travel there as frequently i am disappointed how the service in my oponion for the online service appears to have gone down , my expectations of service and packaging i believe should be higher_than that of a high_street store .
neutral	i regularly buy from chaos_cards and if it had been a month_ago this review would have been 0_stars , however the website is updating and the changes might be minor but they are critical .
neutral	previously if you spent over £_00 you would immediately receive a 00_%_discount when viewing your basket .
neutral	however as we head into autumn you now have to apply the code , and if like me you are a bannerman you can only apply one code where as previously you could apply both codes .
neutral	the shop itself is gaining much rarer items , however at a very high price range , this is off putting and items can be found elsewhere for cheaper .
neutral	i have even found it is cheaper to order from over_seas , pay drastic shipping and even pay custom fees and yet it is still cheaper !
neutral	i could even go on ebay and immediately find items for cheaper .
neutral	despite this chaos_cards do offer decent prices for the more modern products .
neutral	one place that has never_let_me down is there shipping .
neutral	they offer a service that if you order before 0pm they will ship the same or next_day which is a great service that has never_let_me down .
neutral	i have however noticed a remarkable change in their customer_services as they use to be very quick with reply '_s yet recently they have been so slow i have actually gone elsewhere to purchase items .
neutral	overall chaos_cards is a great company , however they are starting to fall behind their competition such as card team , koolkingdom , da card world and troll and toad to name a few .
neutral	this does not however mean that i would not recommend them as their website is easy to navigate through and their stock is improving every day .
neutral	my product , an under unit strip_light , was exactly as_described and good value but , despite_opting for 0st_class delivery at extra_cost , the item took over a week to arrive .
neutral	these days this is a bit_disappointing and the slowest item , of those orderd that week , to arrive .
neutral	i found mazuma super easy to deal with and payment was received via bank_transfer the same day .
neutral	my only issue is the fact i paid for special delivery so insure it got there without the sticky fingers of the royal_mail interfering .
neutral	if the offered free special deliver for more_expensive models i would '_ve given 0 or 0_stars .
neutral	unfortunately this review agrees with thomas .
neutral	i have had exactly the same problems as he has .
neutral	made an order with standard delivery between 0 - 0 business days on monday .
neutral	however it took them a good five days to ready my product for dispatch !
neutral	this was on my week off from work and was hoping for fast ( in the 0 - 0 estimated time ) delivery .
neutral	however i was disappointed not to here from them until friday .
neutral	which meant i would be back at work and unable to receive delivery .
neutral	the products i received i was very pleased with !
neutral	seems like nike have become lazy , taking a very long time to process my order for dispatch .
neutral	even more annoying when ou have to pay for p_&_p !
neutral	other_websites offer free delivery which often comes next_day when ordered early , makes nike performance look very weak !
neutral	shame .
neutral	sorry for the mix_up .
neutral	the tap i purchased from you guys was a wonderful top_notch product but unfortunately didn_'_t fit my bathroom so i returned it but i am still_waiting for the refund .
neutral	i chose to order from lock and key mainly_because of the low_prices that they offered .
neutral	it was easy enough to order online by entering the codes for the keys i needed .
neutral	i chose the free 0 - 0 day delivery however it took somewhere in the region of 0_weeks for the keys to be delivered .
neutral	on top of that the postage was underpaid so i has to pay the 00p shortage plus a £ 0 fee .
neutral	when i first opened the keys i was surprised to see they weren_'_t cut exactly the same as the originals and i doubted they ' d work .
neutral	however , they work fine and the keys are very good quality .
neutral	now i have the keys i '_m happy but the wait was inconvenient at the time .
neutral	as usual finding my tire was not a problem even_though they are rare .
neutral	getting them fitted was not as easy .
neutral	the outfit i chose paid no attention to my appointment time and when i got my car back after 0hr_00mins there were dirty hand prints all over the door . not impressed !
neutral	last order went good and quick but they lost the one before
neutral	happy with service from tile_mountain but courier company did not phone 00_mins before despite having it written in front of them on their paper !
neutral	bloke was so rude when i did arrive 00_mins after his call .
neutral	because of this , next time i '_ll just choose a plce locally i can drive to
neutral	xxxxxxxxxxx
neutral	i use this company on a regular_basis and will keep doing so not been let_down yet
neutral	i use this company on a regular_basis and will keep doing so not been let_down yet
neutral	got car from sixt tampa .
neutral	good transport to and from airport .
neutral	long wait at 00pm to get car .
neutral	00_minutes .
neutral	inexperienced desk assistant ( 0 days in job ) gave_us car 0 grades lower_than paid for ..
neutral	asked if this is correct level of vehicle , told yes .
neutral	nissan versa should have been camry .
neutral	had to travel back next_day after checking web_site to get ordered grade of vehicle .
neutral	guy_who then served_us gave_us correct vehicle , apologised and then got us on our way .
neutral	car was good , a hyundia sonata hybrid .
neutral	bottom_line was that i got a good car at an excellent price .
neutral	sixt need to look at team training before putting employees on a busy front_desk .
neutral	we were pleased with our blinds , but there were a few small things that tainted the experience for us really .
neutral	one of our blinds came in a damaged box and when i turned it up one way all the screws fell out .
neutral	( however the blind itself was not damaged ).
neutral	and the other blind was nice but for some reason it was dirty on one end which wasn_'_t great .
neutral	it did come off with cleaning though .
neutral	hoping our next two blinds are trouble_free .
neutral	edit_: the other two blinds arrived with no_problems .
neutral	we received prompt contact from the company ( as a result of this review ) asking what the problems were and if there was anything they could do to put them right , which i was impressed with .
neutral	ordered on the 00rd november .
neutral	nothing delivered by the 0th_december .
neutral	email not responded to .
neutral	line dead when trying to call customer_services .
neutral	the contacts on your order email confirmation were how i tried to contact you and i have copied them directly from there ;
neutral	tel : 0000 000 0000
neutral	email : customerservices @ justbeautifully . co . uk
neutral	this appears to be different to the email address you mention ?
neutral	i was certainly unable to get through on the phone lines for 0 hours this morning before this initial review was posted and a chase up email sent 00_hours ago to the above email address .
neutral	hence my frustration .
neutral	thank your for your offer of the refund , all i would really like is it delivered by the 0th_december , which in fairness to me is 00 days after the date of order .
neutral	if it can '_t be delivered by then a refund for the paid amount is sufficient .
neutral	special delivery arranged and order delivered just in time .
neutral	been buying online games for years from many websites then came_across this website the other day and bought a few games , received codes in minutes and was a great service .
neutral	only issue i had was when i bought another game the following_day , then i got a email_saying fraud checking please send us 0 copies of identification , driving_license etc , i personally don_'_t think anyone should send this kinda information to a website that don_'_t provide there contact number and there address on there website ( its a 0 way thing we want to know your genuine too ).
neutral	overall though i received the codes i bought and they worked so ive no_complaints there but i would hope this company will look into other ways to verify users without having to share confidential information .
neutral	i was satisfied although there was no communication that the delivery times would be much greater due to new years , however i had already factored in extra time .
neutral	well that phone was brand_new , it should of been worth more than that you have missed out on other phones because of your lowballing , dont get me wrong i got something for the phone but should have been more .
neutral	items generally turn_up when expected , sometimes a bit bashed though and their own delivery drives can be a bit moody .
neutral	when they outsource delivery then it usually is better ( e . g .
neutral	fridges etc )
neutral	i bought a fabro i0000p from dinopc , it appeared to be great value compared to the other deals out there .
neutral	i really love the pc but it encountered some start up problems and when i contacted dinopc they were hesitant to return the pc and fix it .
neutral	the repair took a week but other than that great .
neutral	full of spoofs , you never know who is real and who is fake !
neutral	all the best
neutral	freddie mercury x
neutral	fantastic goods at great prices but the delivery firm they choose to use have the worst review on trust_pilot and quite_rightly so .
neutral	the jacket its self is a fantastic design which fits close to the body whilst keeping you warm and great in the rain but i have problems closing the second and third zip , had it not been for this issue i would have said its the best jacket i '_ve bought in a long time !
neutral	i only ordered a small bulb for the interior light for my fridge , although the bulb is fine and worked i think £ 0 . 00 is a bit_steep fo the delivery .
neutral	also i have to go to my local post_office depot to pick it up as the box it came in was the size of 0 shoe boxes .
neutral	it only had a small piece of bubble_rap around the bulb , the bulb and the wrap would of fitted in a small jiffy_bag no problem
neutral	i suppose , at the end of the day the bulb worked and i '_m just having a moan
neutral	i like topcashback but some things make me not bother with it sometimes !, like the amount of time it takes for cashback to become pay and you are able to withdraw it !
neutral	the waiting time is wayyyyy to long !, another problem that needs to be sorted is retailers need to be held_accountable when they do not keep their end of the deal !
neutral	there is nothing_worse then completing an offer only to find out your never going to get the cashback that you were promised !
neutral	this is wrong and something needs to be done about it !
neutral	apart_from that no other gripes !
neutral	the improvement i would make is to teach people answering the phones how to pronounce company names better .
neutral	i have been dissapointed when i have phoned and listened to how they answer the phone and appear lost in howto pronounce my company name .
neutral	nothing gives it away more that you are using an answering service than when the operator answering the phone cannot pronounce your company name when answering your phone .
neutral	had to pay vat and duty this was not explained during checkout nor was it explained that the goods were coming from abroad .
neutral	i '_ve had furniture from here before and really like it .
neutral	unfortunately this is the second time that an item has_been damaged on delivery so will think_twice about buying any more .
neutral	the delivery also didn_'_t include the furniture wax in the order .
neutral	the company ask that you report any_issues within 00_hours of delivery , however they do not respond back to acknowledge the issue within the same timeframe which is disappointing .
neutral	this villa is in an excellent location and was very clean .
neutral	a few negatives would be the double_bed was extremely hard and there is not a great deal of shade outside .
neutral	beware .. for the first 0 days we were there , the pool_heating was not turned on even_though it was included in the price .
neutral	i only used this site because i had a 00_%_discount_voucher .
neutral	i found the design stage easy to use , but slow .
neutral	that caused some frustration and a occasional re - working .
neutral	my bandwidth is ok , so i assume the speed issue was at the supplier level .
neutral	the ordering_process was clear and efficient .
neutral	was able to track the order throughout , but from order to delivery was weeks , rather_than days .
neutral	as for the photo_book , the photos were reproduced splendidly .
neutral	colours look so much_better on quality paper than on a pc screen or iphone display .
neutral	and as a memento or present , an album fits the bill_perfectly .
neutral	i have few reservations_about the final product here .
neutral	whilst on first look , it seems perfect - one or two of the early pages seem like they are coming loose from the book .
neutral	i have a black background and we can see a white strip on some pages at the binding .
neutral	this means that at the moment , we are turning the pages with delicate care .
neutral	no matter so_far as the perceived loosening is not getting any worse .
neutral	it '_s just that i want it to stay pristine .
neutral	so overall , i am happy given the price i paid .
neutral	have to say that without a 00_%_discount , there would have been reservations - hence only 0_stars .
neutral	will come_back now i ' v found it
neutral	quick response and delivers when promised .
neutral	however quality of boxes seems to have fallen recently ( double_sided sticky_tape not properly applied ) and one or two boxes on the outside of the stack are frequently damaged beyond use .
neutral	would prefer full price to be shown at first rather_than an obligatory booking_fee added later - it '_s poor style and had i had more time would have used another site
neutral	ss presents an extremely untrustworthy image through its eternal 0 - for - 0 offers , like the sofas at giveaway prices on bank_holidays .
neutral	it makes the company sound dishonest , as if its proces are inflated to allow them to be slashed .
neutral	would rather hanve honest , straightforward pricing
neutral	delivery was quick as usual , and i like the updates on the progress of the order , but my order , a third rail for our t00 bike_rack was damaged .
neutral	it was clear that at some point the box had been impacted as the box was torn & taped_up with clear tape .
neutral	it looks_like it was done before posting , but i cant be sure .
neutral	i dont_know if anyone checked the item inside , or just thought it be ok , but the rack has a dent in it .
neutral	ive kept it as its wanted this weekend , but its a shame it has started its life damaged , unlike the rest of the carrier which still looks_like new .
neutral	i '_ve paid for a vw_golf , i received a hyundai that for makingkms is very bad .
neutral	ordered early on a thursday and delivery will be the following_tuesday .
neutral	i know that is within their time limits , but there really is very little reason that next_day delivery could not be provided as it is with loads of other in stock mail order items from other_companies .
neutral	having said that price is good and one has comfort from it being a reliable_source .
neutral	glasses_direct should make it clear ... if you are ordering variofocal lens , do not bother if you don_'_t have the ' distance measurement between your pupils ' and the ' intermediate ' prescription details .
neutral	two trips back to my optician made me look a right muppett .
neutral	in the end i settled for slim lens bifocals .. and they are awesome for driving .. result !
neutral	i think it was an oil gun that i bought from you .
neutral	frankly it is not as good as the simpler one that i '_ve had for 00 years and recently lost , dammit !
neutral	normally i am pleased with apple as they generally delivery within a week and the quality is top_notch but on this occasion i had to wait 0_weeks for my order which apparently was in stock , not particularly good in this day and age .
neutral	when i finally received this there was a lose screw rattling_around in the tower which unfortunately i cannot get to , pretty shoddy considering i paid over £ 0000 for this item , where is the qc checks apple ?
neutral	on the plus_side the customer service is very good , they are very keen to look after you if there is a problem , so at_least there is some redemption on this occasion .
neutral	i placed my order for 0 or 00 products and had to wait 0_weeks before anything arrived , i would have probably waited longer if i hadn_'_t chased them too .
neutral	i had no response to various emails and had to call them a few_times to get any action , will think_twice before ordering from them again .
neutral	i ordered olbas oil for a cold , by the time i received it i was well over it , come on chemist_direct ... you should be better_than this !
neutral	tried to make a call last_week for an_emergency and the house holder said if you go into the loft you might get a connection .
neutral	at my home , i can usually connect from upstairs but little or no signal downstairs .
neutral	not really good enough .
neutral	this site is easy to use , but appears almost_identical to several other train sites in layout and prices ; is this indicative of shared data , as these sites have the same prices as each other every time i look .
neutral	other_sites , such as red spotted handkerchief seem to be different , offer different prices , and are sometimes available before either thetrainline , or the other similar_sites .
neutral	shop around , you may find cheaper rates on the same travel dates , at approximately 00 weeks ahead .
neutral	the title_says it all .
neutral	despite many attempts to stop them sending e_- mail ads to my workplace address , it hasn_'_t stopped .
neutral	it has now been added to the works blocked sender '_s list .
neutral	sorry argos , buck up your customer service ideas .
neutral	on the plus_side however , the site itself is user_friendly , easy to navigate , and easy to reserve items for later pick_up in stores .
neutral	( hence three stars not two .)
neutral	i must_say i '_m slightly dissapointed with the service this time , i ordered the ' grandissamo ' roses and considering the price their was nothing grand about them .
neutral	also a lot of leaves look slightly rotten or eaten by bugs .
neutral	0 rose_heads were almost off the stem too .
neutral	usually have no_problems with serenata so i won_'_t judge on this occasion , just a pity it was valentines_day roses when the standard slipped .
neutral	online order had to be confirmed by phone ( why ?)
neutral	and then my bank thought the transaction was fraudulent .
neutral	this was sorted very quickly but then about a week elapsed after the money was debited from my account before the item was sent for shipping .
neutral	the delay worried me , but everything turned_out well in the end .
neutral	shipping speed was excellent and the goods arrived in very good condition .
neutral	excellent service , but 0 thing , they used ups to australia , i did not see anywhere where they mentioned there would be a service & tax charge at the other end .
neutral	the recipient was not very happy with this , nor was i .
neutral	robinofsuffolk
neutral	find it rather hard to rate a product that i havent really used .
neutral	so i purchased my travel_insurance a week_ago , well i havent been away anywhere yet and hopefully will not need to use my insurance so how can i rate this product ?
neutral	one of the phones i sent back was working ok but when they got them they said it had water_damage but there is no way that could of happen as i wrapped it in bubble_wrap and placed it in the bag they sent me they then said i could have asked for it back from the e_- mail they sent me .
neutral	i did get the e_- mail but 0 mins later i got another e_- mail saying they have now sent my check out with less money as the phone was damaged ?????
neutral	?
neutral	good product but delivery a bit disappointed as the item was left_outside the door when i requested not to .
neutral	only received half of my order , still_waiting ten days_later ?
neutral	they have sent me regular_emails to inform that they still have not dispatched my item .
neutral	good customer service and reasonable delivery times but they will knock off a large_amount of your phone '_s value for minor_issues .
neutral	bacs_transfer payment delivery was shockingly slow ( 0 days once the price was accepted ) - i won_'_t recycle my next phone with orange .
neutral	ok but when i opened the shirt up i found a stain on the sleeve and i '_m hoping it will come out in the wash , would have sent it back there is not enough time
neutral	very dissapointing when you pay for something and you get it three_months later due to being out of stock .
neutral	shame but this has put me off ordering again .
neutral	i ordered my equipment from toolstop on tuesday , and cancelled an arrangement for wednesday because the delivery was to be " next_day ".
neutral	however , on wednesday_evening , whilst i was still_waiting , i received an e_- mail from toolstop advising me of a " status change ".
neutral	i don_'_t know why there was a status change , or what caused it , but my parcel was not shipped until almost 00_hours after it was received by toolstop .
neutral	it arrived on thursday - which is still good , but it makes a mockery of " next_day delivery "
neutral	ordered 0 tyres for moped yet when you do checkout it demands that you put in exact make and model of vehicle that you will fit them to plus mileage thats fine_except the system did not list my bike or that many for that fact so i had to do the order over the phone only to be told never_heard of that make or model before on the plus_side the tyres were considerably_cheaper_than the high_street even with the £_00 . 00 delivery charge added on and came next_day via courier but black_circles are not exactly bike friendly online when ordering shame really
neutral	service normally acceptable on this occasion i have been disappointed as my order was sent to the wrong_address despite you confirming my delivery address by email .
neutral	when i tried to ring could not get through and gave up after trying for over an_hour .
neutral	i ordered my tyres tuesday 00 april , and was amazed to see they could be fitted on thursday_morning 0nd may .
neutral	great news , as i had to be in winchester anyway .
neutral	turned_up , and only 0 of the tyres had arrived .
neutral	had to go home and wait all morning for a phone_call to say the others were in .
neutral	didnt get the call , phoned the fitting_centre at midday to be told they had just arrived .
neutral	another journey into winchester to get them fitted .
neutral	bit disappointed i had to make two jouneys .
neutral	i '_ve_used_tyreshopper before with no_problems - and will_continue to do so - but just a bit_peeved they weren_'_t all delivered on time .
neutral	otherwise , great value as usual .
neutral	footnote : as long as the tyres arrive when they say they will , you wont get a better price or service anywhere .
neutral	despite my slightly negative_feedback , tyreshopper is the place to go .
neutral	ordered my pro mark drum stick bag 0 days ago , and it has only just been dispatched .
neutral	great business , but not their best service at the moment
neutral	green man gaming included an offer for any user who voted in the golden joystick awards in 0000 .
neutral	the offer was for a free game , of a choice between mafia 0 and civilization 0 .
neutral	i chose mafia 0 however i did not receive a key for a while ( it stated clearly that the process could take up to 00_hours ) however the key i received ( after the 00 hour period ) did not work and i e_- mailed support for a replacement .
neutral	i received various " copy + paste " emails that did not relate to my issue and did not help at all , the customer service felt more like an_automated service .
neutral	after 0 days and several_attempts , the key managed to work .
neutral	i felt as though the offer should not be advertised if the system is not working .
neutral	overall the company is good and trustworthy however , due to this blip i am wary of dealing_with support in the future .
neutral	everything was fine
neutral	pros - excellent range of high_quality glasses which you can browse online and even order trials to check they fit .
neutral	excellent range of lens options .
neutral	glasses are competitively_priced and certainly much_cheaper_than high_street prices , plus frequent_special_offers make for superb deals .
neutral	customer service is excellent .
neutral	cons - unfortunately , the reason i know that customer service is excellent is because quality control is not up to standard .
neutral	one of the screws on my recent order was worn .
neutral	this has also happened with a previous order .
neutral	it was efficiently and professionally resolved , however this is a very basic issue which should have been picked_up at the quality control stage .
neutral	summary - happy to order from them again , but in the knowledge that they may not get it right first time .
neutral	at the end of the day i can put up with a little_bit of hassle to avoid being_ripped_off by high_street_opticians .
neutral	bra telefonsupport och_snabba leveranser , men hemsidan är buggig vilket gör det svårt att_beställa .
neutral	under review ...
neutral	there is no option to print transfer confirmation with accurate exchange_rate for tax purposes .
neutral	no option to open business account .
neutral	receipts could be more clear and plain .
neutral	very pleased with the ordering and speed of delivery , my only issue is that the contents were packed in so tightly it had actually damaged one of the products .
neutral	not the end of the world but don_'_t want it to happen again .
neutral	the package arrived in good time , so am happy with the efficient service .
neutral	however , the product has_been exceptionally bad .
neutral	of the 0 bottles , the 0st ran_out of foam in 00 days when it was supposed to last a month ..... the dispenser stopped_working .
neutral	the 0nd bottled fared worse and even_though i '_ve been using the far less quantity ( equal to a finger_tip ) and following all instructions for usage & storage , have run out of foam in 00 days and what oozes out is just liquid .
neutral	am at a loss as to what '_s happening and would prefer a refund .... don_'_t mind returning the bottles for you to check what '_s wrong with the product ..... thoroughly disappointed and frustrated !
neutral	!
neutral	was fine when i first joined but now i frequently have to submit claims for missing transactions albeit from the same merchant so it could be the merchants system rather_than topcashback , but overall quite pleased
neutral	unable to write a full review yet
neutral	i use jk loads and really happy generally .
neutral	i just ordered and received some window deflectors and thought they could be fitted straight_away .
neutral	i now need 0m adhesive promoter which could have been in the pack rather_than me spending another £_00 on a full tub when i '_ll only use a small bit .
neutral	shame really as this is my first poor experience and something that is simple when thought through by the sales_team to make a easy fit quick and buyer happy .
neutral	think flat_pack - everything you need in the box !
neutral	ordered on a sunday and delivery took 00 days which was disappointing but when i moaned about it they explained that there had an a error in dispatch they they refunded delivery cost which was great effort at customer service
neutral	the item was received next_day as promised and looked good - however when i came to wear it on the saturday the elastic securing the head dress was found to be torn and too short ( i suspect the item had been purchased previously , worn , damaged and then returned for a refund ) - although probably not onlinejokeshops fault - i suggest that they thoroughly check all returned items before offering them for resale .
neutral	apart_from this ( although minor takes time and effort to fix at the time ) i was pleased with the service .
neutral	i was happy to see that i could prganise the holiday , flights and everything else possible through travel replublic .
neutral	nice easy website to use and can see what you have paid for and when it has_been paid etc .
neutral	regular e_- mail contact
neutral	only difficulty was when i havd to print all the paper_work and tickets etc , they was really confusing to read and understand what i needed tpo take with me .
neutral	bought a wooden kitchen trolley in march_0000 ebay id - 000000000000 from these_people trading on ebay under the seller name discounthomestore ( since stopped trading on ebay and the web under this name ).
neutral	they are clearly the same people , same names , e_- mail address , telephone_numbers and address .
neutral	the trolley was assembled in april .
neutral	in december it had collapsed .
neutral	there appeared to be no way of getting touch with them .
neutral	i e_- mailed them at their new and their old addresses , not expecting a response .
neutral	both did respond and a refund and collection for the damaged goods was arranged within_00hrs .
neutral	thank_you .
neutral	good website , selection and prices , but appalling delivery service .
neutral	i was in when parcelforce allegedly tried to deliver , did not have a card or receive calls to tell me the item was waiting for me to pick_up , despite parcelforce tracking showing the opposite .
neutral	i phoned up to enquire_about my delivery , and the company did find out where my parcel was being held , but didn_'_t seem bothered about the trouble i ' d had or offer to arrange an_alternative delivery .
neutral	in the en . d i had to leave work early to go and collect , and i really shouldn_'_t have to do this next time i '_ll try a competitor as long as they don_'_t use pracelforce .
neutral	fix the delivery issue and i would buy from you again .
neutral	this review was originally contested because it focused on the delivery too much rather_than the whisky_exchange - seeing as twe can choose their courier , i stand by my review .
neutral	activities were all good .
neutral	the clay shooting was good especially .
neutral	the hotel wasn_'_t clean - although it was good having 0 - 0 to a room , it had the previous occupant '_s bra under the bed , along with a sock .
neutral	decor was rough .
neutral	the capsules don_'_t fit_properly in my nespresso and often just either fall through into the collection tray , or require extra positioning that regular nespresso_capsules do not .
neutral	once the capsule is in place it requires a lot more force to pierce the container too .
neutral	the coffee itself though is rather nice , so it '_s a shame about the capsules !
neutral	i ' d probably order again from the company in future though if these issues were resolved as my order came very quickly and the price is obviously a good saving .
neutral	as for now though i '_m afraid i had to stick in an order with nespresso as i can '_t use these capsules for fear of damaging my machine .
neutral	chat box popped up on several_occasions , but no one replied , and we could not shut it down or move it away from the centre of the screen , so could not read what was on screen behind it .
neutral	otherwise , website is pretty straightforward , although if you change any_aspect of the package , you need to give all your info again .
neutral	ordered the grandissimo display as the standard looked stunning on the website , very disappointed , only 0 more flowers with a load of foliage , so much so , that the flowers just didn_'_t look good .
neutral	update
neutral	complaint lodged with serenata_flowers , and have agreed to refund 00_% of the cost of the amazonia grandissimo order
neutral	everything was going great until website used parcelforce for postage . same thing again parcelforce left a signed for parcel with someone_who is not a neighbour and had to wait 0 more days until i managed to find person_who had signed for it , i thought signed for was for personal only ?
neutral	hi i think everything is perfect about this company , theres just one thing , when i first heard about this company it said the highest prices you could_find going , but ive found a website called simplydrop and every phone published on it you can get more than every phone published on mazuma .
neutral	the glasses are both fine .
neutral	they fit well and they varifocals quality are good again .
neutral	the only problem was with the post ordering service .
neutral	i was told that that one set of frames was no_longer available .
neutral	when i called to change the order it turned_out that the frames had always been in stock .
neutral	the lenses on this delayed order then had to be remade so an order that should have taken a week took over a month .
neutral	i '_m unlikely to use the tinted par much now as all i '_m in the uk for the rest of the summer .
neutral	it took the gloss off an otherwise good service .
neutral	overall a quick and easy process , with payment received in a timely_manner which is good .
neutral	my only issue is that one of my items was listed as expired which means they claim they did not receive the item .
neutral	i know for a fact i included that item in the box .
neutral	what they say goes so you can '_t claim that item back , that '_s it .
neutral	so this leads me to believe either their checking process is not thorough or they claim the odd item missing to get a bit of extra money for themselves .
neutral	this might seem trivial losing out on a £ 0 but it this happens with every customer the company is making a nice little profit .
neutral	very good products and handled the late change of delivery time marvelously .
neutral	the flowers arrived in immaculate_condition .
neutral	only two reservations - the printed message on the card was slightly wonky which was a let_down as it was a beautiful card , and the bear i ordered was a bit squashed from all the packaging .
neutral	otherwise no_problems at all .
neutral	i order an ericsson t00 which was in stock however after waiting sometime to see why my order was not on its way i contacted the company .
neutral	they replied and said they would look into the issue .
neutral	the following_day i had still not heard back so i sent another email and the response was that the ericsson t00 was not in stock !!!!
neutral	so they offered my a similar model which i accepted .
neutral	whats disturbing here is it seemed that between the time i ordered the phone and when i followed up with an email a week_later to see where it was that my order was in limbo .
neutral	would i have been waiting indefinitely to hear about my phone was not in stock if i had have not initiated contact ?
neutral	so obvious problems with their ordering system .
neutral	at present do not take an item thats shows in stock to be true but rather email them first before you order and part with your cash .
neutral	on the flip side the product is great now that its arrived and i am happy with its top condition ( almost as new )
neutral	received the order very promptly and was advised too , in a most timely_fashion , exactly , within a couple of hours , when i could expect delivery - that was excellent .
neutral	alas the engraved plate slid off the trophy within 00_minutes of its arrival and so i have just had to spend the last 00_minutes or so trying to fix it with super_glue - this was not so good .
neutral	ordered several aurora downlights and kosnic led_lamps online expecting and needing usual delivery within 0 - 0 days .
neutral	no news of dispatch after 0 days , had to phone up to chase delivery .
neutral	was informed the led_lamps were out of stock which was delaying the whole order - why didn_'_t anyone let_me know as soon as possible after i placed the order so i could amend the order ( which i then did )?
neutral	if stock_availability is not shown online ( which it isn_'_t and should be ), then the least that should happen is someone to email or phone immediately .
neutral	a day late so couldn_'_t use it
neutral	i walked out of my local o0 shop when they said quote " yeah we are expensive and the trade in is pants - but hey we can sell as many as we like ( 0s )".... so i went to vodaphone and they had a really good deal but no phones .. so went back to 00 .
neutral	no joy , no price match not even for a long_term customer with 0 phones in the family ... so went back to vodaphone .
neutral	they suggested i called o0 retention !!!!!!
neutral	i did - they did a great deal ... but .
neutral	when the new 0s stops working the customer service refer you to an o0 shop - who will have nothing to do with you .
neutral	as neither will apple .
neutral	buying from ' retention ' is deemed to be online and nothing to do with o0 retail_shops .
neutral	poor service , wrong customer service advice - shame about the phone .
neutral	only saving_grace was excellent support from repairs team - but it took me 0 hrs and 0 calls waiting on piped music landlines .
neutral	floor is amazing , looks the part and all visitors have commented on how good it looks .
neutral	had an issue with underlay , i upgraded from the free underlay with the floor but this wasn_'_t the case with what arrived .
neutral	paid aditional for 00hr delivery recived 00 hr delivery
neutral	would of gone to my own chemist if i knew it was going to take 00_hours
neutral	bought two_pairs , single_vision were great , sadly the varifocals have such a small area that i can focus through , they are useless .
neutral	the name says it all " plus ".
neutral	we had no_complaints at all about villa_plus or the villa , it '_s just than the location and price were so disappointing .
neutral	loud booming music nightly , worse on the first night , then moderate on following nights from local hotel entertainment karaoke .
neutral	if this is where villa_plus ' es are , then they are not for us .
neutral	item delivered twice broken .
neutral	staff resent without hassle or complaint each time .
neutral	delivered in good time in each case
neutral	if one pays with a credit_card , one can only have the parcel posted to the address of the card ( my home ) and only during office hours .
neutral	guess where i am pretty_much guaranteed not be , during office hours .
neutral	the laptop was great , by the way .
neutral	wrong goods still_waiting for replacement ?
neutral	not impressed
neutral	i was looking for a roland_cube 00xl for some time .
neutral	roland have dis_- continued this amplifier which is a swiss_army knife of amps containing a looper function which i thought would be cool for practicing .
neutral	i found this one on cash_generator , the pics showed that the amp was in good condition so i went for it .
neutral	it arrived very quickly but i was surprised to see that it was packed in only a single skin of cardboard .
neutral	on first inspection all seemed ok , naturally i wanted to plug it in .
neutral	i then noticed that one of the prongs on the mains_plug was bent and would not fit in the mains socket .
neutral	also i noticed that the grille on the front of the amp had a dent in it .
neutral	i thought about sending it back for a refund but i was curious to hear what it sounded_like so i decided to put another plug on it .
neutral	luckily it worked first time so i thought i ' d keep it .
neutral	i took the grill off and using a rubber hammer got the grille back to a flattish condition , although to be honest the dent is still visible .
neutral	i intend to use the amp for gigging so no doubt it will receive a few more dings along the way .
neutral	i emailed cash_generators the details of my experience and advised them to double box heavy items such as this amp in future , they in turn offered me a £_00 discount off future_purchases from the leith shop .
neutral	( thanks chris )
neutral	i ordered an 0in splash cymbal for my friend for christmas , but unfortunately the delivery date was a long time after , about 00 days in fact , but was then further postponed without telling_me when it would arrive , 0 days_later the item arrived .
neutral	today .
neutral	in great condition and a great product .
neutral	excellent trainers and good pass rate , let_down by poor communication and administration .
neutral	i did use them last_year although i understand that was a different company .
neutral	cheap but never had to use them
neutral	great online buying experience but later found out after my order that one item was out of stock .
neutral	good email communication but would have been better to know it was out of stock before purchasing the item .
neutral	part shipped with a quick delivery and looking_forward to receiving the later part of the order .
neutral	good service but they do not honor their price match if found cheaper , and they don_'_t want to sell that cheap they won_'_t .
neutral	so spent £_000 . 00
neutral	with bathrooms & showers_direct .
neutral	their loss 😟
neutral	( did contact you no one rang me back )
neutral	great mask re detail but very uncomfortable to wear .
neutral	when put on you can '_t see out of it so walking blind most of the time .
neutral	ok to wear for a few minutes to scare someone but could not wear to a fancy_dress party as you cannot see through the eyes .
neutral	i repeat i haven_'_t been yet
neutral	booked this hotel as it said in your info that part of the deal was wireless internet in room it hadn_'_t just a cable for broadband .
neutral	not happy as wouldn_'_t have booked if i had of been told the truth .
neutral	i have an ipad so it '_s no use .
neutral	tell people the truth please .
neutral	although their signal is the best and they have good offers for new customers , they really do not look after their existing_customers at all .
neutral	their customer_services team is either very rude , don_'_t care or totally get things wrong .
neutral	+ ve - speed of delivery was fantastic
neutral	- ve - quality of paper used in printing as well as the quality of printing itself are not very good .
neutral	i phoned aol to set_up a new phone line and broadband at my new home because i am moving , and they switched me over to talktalk .
neutral	i spent about 00_minutes setting it up on the phone , but the first order got lost so luckily i called back the next_day to check .
neutral	they had to set it all up again .
neutral	then when they sent me a confirmation e_- mail it said that i could " track your order now " by logging in through " my account ".
neutral	but when i tried to log in using my aol e_- mail address and password , it would not let_me .
neutral	i called talktalk again and they confirmed that i should use my aol password , but again i had no success .
neutral	it seems i may have to wait_until i receive a welcome_pack so that i can enter my talktalk account number , but it seems a bit daft sending me a confirmation e_- mail with a link button to " track your order now " if it won_'_t work until after i have received the welcome_pack .
neutral	it '_s all a bit_confusing , and not very reassuring .
neutral	( and before i did this , i wish i had seen some of the reviews on this site .
neutral	there are rather a lot of bad_experiences listed here which makes me feel rather uncomfortable about choosing talktalk for my new connection .
neutral	i am self_employed and i absolutely have to have a reliable broadband_connection to do my work .
neutral	this move had better go smoothly , talktalk , or there will be trouble !)
neutral	very easy , all online and delivery fairly quick .
neutral	slightly_disappointed when trophies arrived , the website doesnt portray how small they are !
neutral	don_'_t like play . com much anymore with all these traders , first time i '_ve ordered from one and never received the item was a con .
neutral	go back to how it was play !!!
neutral	however , play did refund me and communication was good , albeit quite a wait to have to process a refund .
neutral	i ordered a monitor on sunday_evening paying for next_day delivery before 0 ; 00 pm ,
neutral	so assuming that they would get my order monday_morning i should recieve my monitor on tuesday before 0 00 , i waited all day ..... for nothing , i sent an email via amazon to pcbuyit asking about the situation on tuesday , saturday now , no response , how ever i did get an email asking me to review them .
neutral	apart_from that the monitor arrived on wednesday , i liked the fact i could use amazon to pay , saves me typing all my details again .
neutral	it did not come on tuesday as ive stated ??
neutral	?
neutral	i received what i ordered , in good shape .
neutral	but the delivery process was quite ridiculous and i had to take a day off work to be there when the parcel arrived .
neutral	i received an email in the morning informing_me when it would arrive -- and it was on time - but being the middle of the day i just couldn_'_t go to work .
neutral	it '_s a real_shame that i was able to place an order and pay only to be told there is no stock and no idea when i will receive it !
neutral	would be nice to be refunded or given a realistic date or better still delivery me what i purchased . always had a good service previously so hope this isn_'_t a slippery slope they are on !
neutral	thought the quality was good and was good value for money , was let_down by the missing roof felt and that when i emailed i did not get a response from them .
neutral	had to purchase felt to complete the shed so cost me another £_00 .
neutral	shopto are great for fast delivery ( usually next_day if you order before 0 . 00pm ), however their prices are getting worse imo .
neutral	there are numerous retailers around now who i can buy the same game from for around a few_pounds_cheaper and still get it delivered the next_day .
neutral	this an update the came on wednesday last_week at 0 : 00 and i ask the driver to wait at the the door with me checking the product and everything_went fine thank u
neutral	delayed cash_back nearly 0 months , but they got me the mentioned value , so trust_worthy
neutral	i ordered 0 flat wiper_blades , great price ( nobody_else got close ) and delivered next_day , well_packaged .
neutral	fittings were a bit_fiddly but got there in the end .
neutral	two of the wipers are fine but the 00 " ones both smear .
neutral	had chucked the packaging away by the time i used them in anger so stuck with them for now .
neutral	don_'_t think i '_ll be having any more .
neutral	i was interested in buying a garden_bench ( norfolk , racing green , circa_£_000 from memory ).
neutral	the dimensions were not on the website , rang the helpline and the gentleman while helpful could not find the dimensions either and said he ' d leave instructions to get the information to me and get the dimensions on the website .
neutral	asked the same question on your email system but did not get a reply .
neutral	waited for the call and eventaually rang again and after a bit of back and forth received the dimensions and ordered the bench .
neutral	the bench itself is good except in one respect .
neutral	where you screw in the arm rest to the back of the bench , this angle has_been made wrong and does not sit flush .
neutral	product arrived fairly quickly and well_packaged .
neutral	i feel the markup was a little dear though .
neutral	good website overall however but your competitor allow more informations for each house on their website like you can filter by most reduced , most_popular , .. you can even when the price has dropped and how much , when was the last sale and how much , how long this house is on the market , the number of views since maketed , as well as the last 00 days number of view , and more important a tool to estimate your house min , max , average ,,, that is a shame all of these usefuls datas to position a house on the market is not included or available to all users in your website .
neutral	i have always used ebuyer as my first call for all things electronic .
neutral	the company itself is excellent , stocking a wide_range of great value goods .
neutral	recently i have had several bad_experiences not with ebuyer but with the delivery company they use .
neutral	i have just placed an order with ebuyer to try them again .
neutral	hopefully the delivery will be ok !
neutral	if not i would probably look_elsewhere for my electronic goods in the future .
neutral	ok experience .
neutral	when i bought my motorhome it was fitted with winter_tyres , which is great in winter .
neutral	i wanted five new tyres for summer use as i am planning a mammoth route through northern europe mountain ranges .
neutral	and this seemed to be the best way to get some premium quality tyres at a reasonable price .
neutral	however , you know , i am more interested in the mountains i will climb on the journey than the tyres .
neutral	getting a kilt organised was very straight - forward , the staff are all knowledgeable and politely approachable .
neutral	having hired a kilt before from the shop , all the details were present , and it was a pleasant change to have service with a bonus given to existing_customers .
neutral	the one item that was a negative experience was queuing for over 00_minutes to have an up to date measurement a few_days before hiring the kilt .
neutral	the measurement only took 0 minutes max , there were more staff moving around the shop than there were customers .
neutral	this was on thurs 00th_july ,
neutral	i paid extra to have express delivery and it still took over a week to get my purchases , i dred to think how long the standard delivery would have taken .
neutral	i ordered other things from other_sites at the same time without paying extra for express delivery and got them the next_day including one from china which only took 0 days to arrive .
neutral	very poor delivery timescales in this day and age .
neutral	product was as_described and packaged well though .
neutral	i found the guys at amigo to be very friendly and their communication was good however , i did find the process to much more time_consuming than they lead you to believe .
neutral	whilst they give you the impression that there are no credit_checks , there are and very lengthy detailed discussion around that .
neutral	it is also not clear whilst the guarantor needs to be between 00 - 00 and a home owner , they also have to provide a payslip which for me suddenly_became very embarrassing .
neutral	it should also be made very clear up front as i was going to ask someone very wealthy and rich who has taken early retirement so does not have a payslip , good job i did not .
neutral	for me , all of this spoilt things a little !
neutral	play . com offer some great goods at reasonable prices , my only complaint is the speed of delivery , it normally takes 0 - 0 days to deliver to worcester uk , orders form amazon also based in jersey , normally arrive in 0 - 0 days .
neutral	their deals are great , and always buy one get one free .
neutral	the trial is great for finding the right frames .
neutral	my only problems have been with one of the two_pairs .
neutral	my first order , the glasses were fine , but the prescription_sunglasses went back three_times , and i removed the uv_filter to fix it .
neutral	second time , one pair ok , the second had a crack in the arm .
neutral	all problems were solved quickly , but would have preferred to not have them , but guess it would cost more .
neutral	ive been with vodafone for a while but my friends have better deals and offers .
neutral	i had pre ordered a game around 0 - 0 months it was actually released and then it comes late .
neutral	on pickup the car was a manual , not an automatic as booked .
neutral	couldn_'_t get an auto until the following week .
neutral	the initial car was described as clean when in fact it had very bad scratching to each front corner and the left rear , was covered in dirt and much more seriously , a large crack in the windscreen .
neutral	second vehicle was better but again still covered in muck inside and out despite picking it up mid - afternoon
neutral	so i '_ve got all this por00 paint and all set to spray underside of pick - up ,
neutral	but wait ... where the ' eck is my solvent ?
neutral	tried twice_now to order but still " out of stock ".
neutral	ok , its just solvent right ?
neutral	well to be certain i emailed the question to frost , ie .
neutral	what other solvent product would be compatable with por00 ?
neutral	unfortunately as yet , ( weeks have become months )....... no answer !
neutral	!
neutral	i so want to give you a 0_star_rating , please answer my queri .
neutral	undoubtedly a great price and fitting service for tyres , however i followed an advert from their own site offereing a £_00 sainsburys voucher , only to find out it had expired over a year_ago , but their web_site didn_'_t say that , it just leads you to buying their products , this equated to an extra £_00 off each tyre .
neutral	when i emailed them all i got was a reply saying it was out of day ... end of .
neutral	i replied back asking for a good will gesture .... still got nothing .
neutral	after sales service not too great .
neutral	my order was fulfilled promptly but a mistake meant that one item was missed off the order and replaced by a ( random ) other item .
neutral	when this was pointed_out to dentocare staff they initially claimed that it was my mistake and that i had incorrectly ordered .
neutral	i would have to submit another order to get the item that i wanted .
neutral	when i pointed_out that their order acknowledgement confirmed what i had said they agreed that , perhaps , it was their system that was at fault after all .
neutral	they then sent me the item which i received the next_day .
neutral	obviously the sales / online ordering system needs to be fixed but it also leads to better customer_care if you don_'_t automatically tell the customer that they are wrong before checking up on what did happen .
neutral	ok apart_from system asked us to pay again on exit .
neutral	attendant sorted easily
neutral	it was easy to get cover with uia and so_far i have no cause to complain
neutral	you did a great thing by calling to check if my girlfriend was still going to be at her work later in the afternoon as you were behind schedule .
neutral	i said she would be there until 0pm but you said you would be able to deliver by 0 :_00pm which seemed fine .
neutral	however you then ruined the surprise by calling her and telling her you were running late and wouldn_'_t be there until 0pm , but then delivered it by 0 :_00pm anyway .
neutral	i think eflorist are great , but you really messed this one up needlessly and the surprise could have been maintained .
neutral	in response to the reply :
neutral	have you even read what i '_ve written ?
neutral	you may be " sorry ", but why haven_'_t you told me as a customer how you are going to improve your processes to avoid this happening again in future ?
neutral	right now your response just looks_like a fob off of to my review ...
neutral	bought a 00watt led tube to replace the standard 00watt kitchen tube .
neutral	was very expensive but got it due to it coming with a starter to bypass the original starter .
neutral	was a little annoyed that the enclosed_instructions recommended to bypass the ballast for maximum energy_saving as product description didn_'_t mention this ( paid alot more for this to avoid having to do that !
neutral	).
neutral	dispatch was fast with quick tracked delivery .
neutral	probably wouldn_'_t use this website again as the items are very expensive compared to simillar items elsewhere then also have to pay p_&_p !
neutral	every time i order i '_m left with tons of packaging to dispose of !
neutral	their super_saver delivery service has significantly slowed_down since i first started shopping with them .
neutral	pricing is good on the whole but often find stuff cheaper_elsewhere and recently sent price notice for a microwave that was £_00 cheaper on another site ( with free next_day delivery !)
neutral	but got no response .
neutral	obviously i bought it from the other retailer but would have preferred amazon due to their easy return process .
neutral	the ring was perfect , excellent value and my now fiancee was so happy with it , the only_gripe i have , 0 people promised me a delivery date so that my girlfriend wasnt aroind when it was deliverd , didnt show up on time as promised and she ended_up singing for the package , luckily as it is very descreetly packaged she didnt know , but tue whole_thing was almost ruined by a failed promise
neutral	price good , ring good ... setting bad .
neutral	we lost the diamond after just 0_weeks and thank our lucky stars as we found it .
neutral	jewelers said it was not properly set and added onto the base of the ring .
neutral	would be great if you buy it like that as they don_'_t replace your diamond if lost although the setting was bad .
neutral	other than that great company , delivered on time and diamond is as they said it is .
neutral	i have used cjs a few_times , first 0 orders were great but i think it was about the 0th order it took a few_days for me to be able to collect it , i got an email_saying it was regarding a fraud check or something and it would only happen once , however after ordering again the same problem occurred on auto_key and i was unable to " instantly " get the product key .
neutral	tried again and the exact_same problem still_waiting for it to allow to collect it .
neutral	when the service works , its great , when it doesn_'_t , you ' re in the dark .
neutral	delivery came on two_separate days , which was a bit of a pain , and i had to contact them in order to find out when second delivery was on its way .
neutral	.
neutral	bath_panel wasn_'_t with bath , and wasn_'_t clear it was an extra .
neutral	as the bath was in an entire set with the panel for not much more than i paid for the bath . now i have a bath with no panel .
neutral	it is out of stock , and when it is back in stock , going to have to pay an arm and a leg for delivery !
neutral	other than those things , customer service is good and was prompt .
neutral	would probably use again .
neutral	its been a couple of years since i last flew with virgin_atlantic .
neutral	my recent return trip to boston left me a little dissapointed .
neutral	where has the high_quality service with a smile dissapeared to .
neutral	i have never seen such a fed_up looking cabin_crew ( both_ways ).
neutral	is it something to do with code sharing ?
neutral	come on virgin .
neutral	lets get back to the way it used to be - fun to fly with virgin
neutral	the front of the axe ( designed to look like it '_s sticking in your head ) looks good but someone forgot to attach the back of the axe .
neutral	will have to make_sure i don_'_t turn_round !
neutral	update_: chloe at yodel came to my rescue - and for that , i '_ve updated my marks !
neutral	thanks for all your help .
neutral	old review : if you are buying goods from an online_retailer , always check if they use yodel as the courier - if they do - buy the good elsewhere .
neutral	seriously .
neutral	don_'_t be tempted by thinking it won_'_t happen to you .
neutral	they tell you they have delivered items , which they blatantly haven_'_t .
neutral	they say they left them on your doorstep - when they clearly didn_'_t .
neutral	the support staff are laughably unhelpful and just tell you to contact your online_retailer .
neutral	when its clearly the courier at fault .
neutral	booking experience was simple and efficient but was given wrong information on the hotel !
neutral	stipulates that travelodge aberdeen airport is within a mile of the airport when in fact it transpired it was a fifteen minute_drive away
neutral	no problem on arrival , car checked and advised there could be max 00 to 00 miles on clock on return . car was waiting in short terrm car_park on our return . good . the only problem i had was that the car was covered with dusty mud as though it had been parked in a potato field for the duration !
neutral	items listed should state if they are in stock or not .
neutral	also any additional_charge for faster delivery .
neutral	kept well informed on order status by e_- mail
neutral	i dislike using low_cost airlines , especially ryanair , however , on my recent_trip to marrakesh , both the outward and return journeys were on time and the baggage was delivered within 00_minutes of landing .
neutral	the on - board service was terrible and they had no food left on the return_journey ; the stewards were badly trained and didn_'_t give a fig about anything , but it is a low_cost airline and they are one of the few carriers who fly directly to marrakesh .
neutral	i have been with orange for fifteen_years - like most large companies it '_s terribly difficult to any sort of continuity of service .
neutral	i have just received a new blackberry and had the benefit of a very good deal .
neutral	however , one part of the ' deal ' was that i would be able to get help with the setting_up of the phone - i have little use in my right hand and need help with the mechanics of installing a sim_card etc ..
neutral	i was told that i could go into my local orange shop ( newark - on - trent ) and that someone would assist me .
neutral	i was ' greeted ' by a most offensive and rude man , who told me that ' it was not his job '!
neutral	after trying to calm him down and explaining what i had been told by the salesperson on the phone , he eventually told me that he couldn_'_t / wouldn_'_t help .
neutral	he accused me of being offensive to him .
neutral	he also told me that he didn_'_t know anything about my phone anyway - they were selling them !!!!
neutral	!
neutral	i requested that my new phone be returned to me and left the shop .
neutral	i then went into carphone_warehouse , with whom i had spent no money and an extremely_helpful young_man assisted_me and when i asked how much i owed for the service , was told that there was no charge .
neutral	zero out of ten to orange - ten plus to carphone_warehouse !
neutral	park offer an excellent service but are let bown by the courier service they use .
neutral	i am at work , during the week , so if a courier doesn_'_t deliver to a neighbour ( not always the best policy ) then i have to collect from their depot .
neutral	this depot was 00 miles_away , if they offered on royal_mail or delivery to work if you used 0ds payment , then i would be ok . makes me think_twice about using them again .
neutral	steve
neutral	likes
neutral	website ordering very easy and prices extremely attractive .
neutral	products met my expectations
neutral	dislikes
neutral	doubling up of postage charge i assume this was to post items between different warehouses before despatch to myself , as cycling knicks do not add weight nor volume to my small order .
neutral	otherwise well happy
neutral	i give them a bad address , 0 minute after order i tell them about the error but they said to me that the article was shipped and no possibility to change address .. now i '_m hoping tha however will arrive ..
neutral	purchased 0 cans of thompsons one coat damp proofing .
neutral	price started as
neutral	best anywhere but the free transit over min .
neutral	spend ended_up with £ 0 special fluids delivery charge ... no explanation as to why .
neutral	could understand carriers fears ref toxic and flamable fluids but this was water based material ??
neutral	needed the stuff so went_ahead even_though price now nearly same as b_& q on codgers 00_%_discount day !!
neutral	fast delivery .
neutral	a bit of a wait for my kit and the shower chair had a broken weld .
neutral	this was dealt_with very quickly by ccs and a replacement issued .
neutral	would i buy from then again - yes ,
neutral	compared prices with other trade in sites and zapper came out well , although not always the best .
neutral	completed several trades but took a whopping 0 . 0_weeks from posting my stuff to physically receiving my cheques which isn_'_t great and a bit of an archaic payment_method in my opinion ... considering faster_payments are now the norm and used by other_companies .
neutral	there is also the hassle of getting to a bank to pay the cheques in and having to wait a further 0 working_days to clear , so if you are in a hurry for your money ... think again !
neutral	but on the positive_side i didn_'_t have a problem with any of my stuff going missing or being rejected so was paid in full .
neutral	using collect_+ is also ideal as it bypasses the post_office and have literally walked in and straight of my local shop dropping the parcels off .
neutral	all in all , no issues with my items but wasn_'_t expecting it to take as long as it did to receive the cheque .
neutral	expensive returns_policy and took_ages for refund , had to chase it 0 times , took .
neutral	0_weeks even_though i ordered and paid for a replacement on a separate order .
neutral	no option to change or delete something entered in error
neutral	sent my phone undamaged and when it arrived the screen was broken so even_though it was not my fault my payment went down from £_00 to £_00 .
neutral	a little unfair i thought .
neutral	usually very happy with your photo_books but this time although it was placed in an envelope with do not bend written on it , the envelope was bent when it reached us & the corner of the book ( cover & 00 pages was bent !)
neutral	it is to be given as a xmas_present & as it has only arrived today 00th_december , no time to get it replaced .
neutral	therefore very disappointed .
neutral	clearly you need to use stronger envelope especially as you charge £ 0 , 00 for postage & packaging .
neutral	i ordered this bouquet for our_wedding_anniversary .
neutral	the flowers were ordered on tuesday and delivered on wednesday , so the system works well .
neutral	the flowers had a nice hand_written card attached and looked good when they arrived .
neutral	i returned home on the thursday and was disappointed with the flowers , the yellow_roses in particular we ' re wilting and the stems and leaves looked very dry and poor .
neutral	if i had spent the same amount at m & s or waitrose i would have had twice as many flowers and based on my experience , much_better quality that would have lasted far longer .
neutral	went for the bespoke finish ...
neutral	they needed 0_weeks to do the work .
neutral	part of the work was for three joints .
neutral	one edge was good , one not matched and one not cut square .
neutral	the surface finish which i was charged for three oil coats was poor .
neutral	a level on the surface showed a surface wave which is why joint two was poor .
neutral	the surface i could fix , so i just raised the not square edge .
neutral	they asked for photos then measurements .
neutral	the " suggestion " was to take the joints apart use plenty of glue and re - fix .
neutral	decided that they didn_'_t seem to care so had the joint reworked and the surfaces smoothed .
neutral	half a dozen oil coats and it looks good ( wife very happy ).
neutral	oh and the sink_cut out did not match the sink despite the " tell us the make and we will cut it " .
neutral	my suggestion is buy the worktops un cut or shaped and diy or pay someone you trust to do .
neutral	i used this service 0 yeas ago as well and got more money for my phone , both were high end htc startphones but the most_recent was very powerful and i was surprised to be offered a third less .
neutral	further surprised to have a amount reduced a tenth once it had been received .
neutral	both phones we very well used but both technically worked ( the most_recent one more so ).
neutral	we know these phones aren_'_t being used again , they are being recycled , so scratched cases shouldn_'_t make a difference ( it didn_'_t 0 years_ago ).
neutral	lastly , 0 years_ago you were also beating your competitors , offering more money and better security / assurance ( in what was a new process for me ) in that you were orange , or very least you are directly associated with them .
neutral	this time around you were competitive still but you weren_'_t offering the best price , i picked you for the security / assurance which i find disappointing .
neutral	all the choices for phone_recycling ( yourselves included ) say the price may vary upon_inspection so 0 years_ago , as i had no experience of this process , i was pleasantly_surprised when the offered price didn_'_t change .
neutral	needless to say that is no_longer a tick against your name either so in the future i will use your service if you are offering a similar , or better , price , because i trust you .
neutral	but if other_companies offer significantly more i might risk sending my expensive phone to some random company and cross my fingers that they don_'_t just steal it .
neutral	easy to navigate the website and place my order , quickly uploaded prescription and completed my order .
neutral	i was very annoyed that having paid express postage_costs that it still took 0 days for mds to arrive , i know other_firms using free first_class post at similar cost , i shall use them in future .
neutral	cool new red jum ... wait a minute ....!!!!
neutral	why is it blue ?
neutral	okay , so i ordered red and you guys sent me blue and i quite like the colour and i decided to keep the jumper .
neutral	i hear it ’_s going to be cold this winter and this will keep me warm while out and about .
neutral	besides ; me sending it back won_’_t be worth it as the item is £ 0 . 00 ( including tax ) and p_&_p ( postage and packaging ) is near enough £ 0 . 00 and me sending it back would be about the same and you people probably_won_'_t refund return postage so i '_ll be left with £ 0 . 00 .
neutral	0_stars !!!
neutral	!
neutral	has anyone noticed how stingy amazon have become lately ?
neutral	first they put a limit on how much you need to spend for you to qualify for supersaver delivery , then they delay the delivery of goods till the following week .
neutral	0_stars amazonuk .
neutral	oh fantastic .
neutral	i ’ ve been looking for a type of combat_trousers i only ever want wear for work for nearly a year after the one i had for 0years began to ware away .
neutral	so i done numerous searches online under many different names ( name of the combat_trousers ) and i nearly gave up till i done one last search and i came cross these_guys .
neutral	i saw payment_method was paypal which was more than good enough for me because if anything went wrong , there be no middle_man and it would have been left solely to the seller to resolve any deputes as they see fit .
neutral	anyway .... paypal yay - i didn_’_t even think about it , i went right on in there and brought 0 pairs .
neutral	a couple days_later it came , but the bag one of the pairs was in was opened and the other was not which suggest to me the opened one could have been tried on by someone_else before he sent it back .
neutral	it was neatly_packed though ... yup .
neutral	anyway so i soaked it in disinfectant and bunged it in the wash . it ’_s the reason for 0_stars otherwise it would have been 0 .
neutral	i had to delete one bad review towards aliexpress , because they refunded my monies to my account .
neutral	i sent a letter of complaint to aliexpress complaints_department about a seller and although nothing was said about my complaint , the end of last month , i was refunded .
neutral	will i shop there again ?
neutral	personally , i wouldn ’_t chance it .
neutral	maybe i got lucky .
neutral	i just wanted to put it out there that i got a refund is all .
neutral	i brought 0 pair of work trousers last_week from qtag which were in the wrong_size .
neutral	qtag '_s ridiculous , pointless policy is no sending items back in exchange for the correct_size .
neutral	so , i sent it back ( note ; using £ 0 p_&_p recorded - stupid post_office worker ) and resubmitted my order in the correct_size .
neutral	* sigh *
neutral	total amount again came up to £_00 . 00 including p_&_p , just like with the first transaction .
neutral	days_later , i got refunded via_paypal to the sum of £_00 . 00 .
neutral	now i '_ll think_twice about purchasing from them again .
neutral	if i '_m to return , ( a big if ) i '_ll have to be cautious not to make wrongful purchases as they will deducted a whopping amount for returns .
neutral	nah forget it because it costs more in p_&_p for multiple items .
neutral	a good thing i didn_'_t purchase two of em in incorrect sizes at once that time .
neutral	never again !
neutral	if you create a truthful and honest review about an experience you have had with an online supplier who use trustpilot and should you dare to publish a poor service , the retailer then objects if you give them a low score .
neutral	trustpilot then threatens to have your review removed if you don_'_t change it .
neutral	i don_'_t believe that this is then a fair or independent review of the service or experience received when forced to change the review !
neutral	could this be because the retailers have paid trustpilot to be on their website !!!!!!!
neutral	!
neutral	can consumers then trust the reviews placed on trustpilot ? and are trustpilot actually unbiased or simply just protecting the retailers to publish and promote high scores ?
neutral	regards alan hinman .
neutral	0rd_july_0000 .
neutral	great service and quick delivery , though was not told that order was dispatched and order was not tracked so didn_'_t know when it would arrive .
neutral	also i expect 0 - 0 day delivery to be free on orders that total £_000 - seriously sort it out .
neutral	i got what i paid for it was four mats for a freelander and it came on time they where cheap , i wish i had paid another £_00 for the proper ones , these where thin and the smell of rubber is so strong it smells like a durex factory ,
neutral	we were disappointed with the villa , but made the decision not to allow it to ruin our holiday .
neutral	the villa_itself could be excellent , but is in dire need of a thorough clean at the very least but ideally a refurb .
neutral	everything looks well used ( e . g .
neutral	kitchen , sofas , loungers ) at best , but certain non - functionals ( e . g .
neutral	the poor repair of the shower_curtain in place of the broken section of shower_screen in the master en_suite ; the shower_head which wouldn_'_t stay upright in the double ensuite ) plus the mould in the master ensuite , the dirty loungers , etc .
neutral	really let the villa down .
neutral	having spent over £ 0000 renting the villa , i do feel very let_down by the villa_plus brand .
neutral	overall , its good .
neutral	but for a special_edition game , shopto need to use better packaging , the product is a little_bit dented on delivery , a single layer bubble_wrap just doesn_'_t cut it , for a normal dvd case its fine , but not when its a boxset ,
neutral	love the shelving , easy to put up and looks brilliant ... however ... they decided to use uk mail to deliver .
neutral	even calling bigdug directly didn_'_t get it delivered when i ' d taken the day off , what a disaster !
neutral	despite someone being in they said they couldn_'_t deliver on the original date , the next 0 days were excuses ranging_from the delivery van is too small to the packing is too heavy for 0 man .
neutral	each package weighs 00 - 00kg maximum .
neutral	eventually it got sorted no thanks to either bigdug or uk mail .
neutral	the product really is great !
neutral	shame about the customer service .
neutral	had to return a pair of glasses as the wire holding the lens in broke and the lens fell out .
neutral	glasses_direct were very good at responding to my request for a solution and i returned the glasses .
neutral	they replaced the lens as it was chipped when it fell out , but it took a very long time to get them returned , almost 0_weeks .
neutral	when they came back to me , the new wire was not very tight and within a few_days the lens fell out again .
neutral	i returned the glasses and it took another 0_weeks to get this fixed .
neutral	although there was no cost to me i felt that this should have been actioned more quickly and their quality control needs to be tightened up a lot .
neutral	not sure if i will use them again .
neutral	the food is superb and not to be_faulted but the company is let_down by an un - reliable delivery partner ...
neutral	the staff are very friendly & helpful .
neutral	orders placed to date have turned into a delivery nightmare !
neutral	good price but attempted delivery to wrong_address .
neutral	mistake on address translation to courier .
neutral	less_than helpful reception to telephone_call .
neutral	00 broken_tiles at time of delivery .
neutral	positive response to further phone_call with offer to replace broken_tiles .
neutral	all went well with ordering and paying for the tumble_drier i received an email to confirm and was assured someone would contact me from the shipping dept .
neutral	but alas two calls later still no confirmed delivery .
neutral	then another email arrives but no delivery time another phone_call and the weather is against us but worst case_scenario we will deliver thursday but probably sooner but on friday still no delivery and am assured a saturday delivery is on ..... a nice young_lady says second drop saturday between 0 . 00am and 00 . 00am on the phone followed_by a confirmation_email and a text_message .
neutral	having got up early on saturday cleared the old_appliance outside and waited at 00 . 00 another phone_call to be told there were issues with the van yesterday and the driver would be phoned and i would be phoned back .
neutral	a 00 . 00 another phone_call to be told the van driver would be phoned
neutral	to be told that he would definitly be there 00 . 00 . i got a call from the driver to say he was leaving canvey island and i finally got my delivery .
neutral	if only somebody would keep the paying customers informed and updated it would save all the calls and hanging on which do nothing to encourage further buisiness
neutral	ordered for special_occasion so needed same day what i ordered only to to recieve confirmation_email_stating it would be delivered the next_day , customer service no assistance said they would try to arrange it flowers did turn_up following_day not impressed will not be using again
neutral	poor communication between garage and carloans0u , unable to pick car up on agreed date garage blamed finace not being paid on time eg not being transfered , and finance co blamed garage ?, not sure who was kiddin who , to be fair though the customer service from carloans 0u was always on the case quickly and very efficiently , just be carefull of their " approved dealers " hensons " is the worst garage i have ever ever came_across im now in touch with trading_standards and vosa !!!
neutral	!
neutral	the service and communication between tdl and myself has_been second to none .
neutral	without a doubt i would give 0_stars for sorting_out the faulty product that i was sold .
neutral	it is a dissapointing that i have been laboured with a postage charge that i believe should be refunded as it is not my fault the product failed and should not be held_responsible for delivery charge .
neutral	simple web_site to find what i wanted , simple ordering system , great price and quick delivery ... can '_t ask for more ...
neutral	oh_dear , after only minimal use two of the zips on the case have broken .
neutral	i will be contacting bags direct to arrange for a replacement .
neutral	will update when i have received a reply .
neutral	i use the web a lot for shopping and research and i see excellent sites and those that border on the tedious .
neutral	i '_m afraid i feel the first_tutors site is more towards the latter .
neutral	the experience follows the stages of enter requirements , filtered search , summary of tutors available , buy access to tutors ' details , contact tutors .
neutral	these stages could be shown along a progress line .
neutral	as it is you are not clear where you are and where you are going .
neutral	the buy stage is eventually shown on a green button but it doesn_'_t say " buy " although on seeking help that is the term the helper used showing further inconsistency in the approach because you then look for a button saying " buy " you get lots of warnings saying do not expose contact details but these would be better as pop - ups rather that cluttering up the task .
neutral	a request for fairness might also be better_than a straight threat in this regard although maybe there have been a lot of people violating the exposure rule in an attempt to save what is really a reasonable fee .
neutral	there is an assumption that the person using the site is the potential tutee but in my case i was using it for a friend whose english was not very good !
neutral	a fairly obvious possibility given some users are looking for tuition and in my case for english as a foreign language !
neutral	another possibility will be parents searching on behalf of their children .
neutral	in all the service delivers and is great for both tutors and learners but the search experience could be so much_better .
neutral	i '_m still_waiting my order ... may be superfood use very bad delivery company .. i spoke to the delivery company - ukmail , they rearrange the delivery for monday ( instead friday ), i was waiting all day .. no delivery .
neutral	today , tuesday i called again .. promised for tomorrow ...
neutral	woulld say that your site was one of the best for getting a return on your money
neutral	but my opinion has changed because over last 0_weeks i have not had any luck
neutral	i have just been depositing money so i dont see the point on going on iam just losing money so i am not playing anymore .
neutral	regards derek
neutral	hi_folks ,
neutral	i would have no_problems using the scottish_kilt company again .
neutral	there '_s a good range of products and secure methods of paymen but the preparation for post and packaging then delivery of the goods can be a w bit_slow .
neutral	if this was to be speeded_up a little then i would upgrade my regard for your company from good to very good .
neutral	competitive price and promptly delivered but was disappointed to find the bookshelf bracket strips were slightly_bent and 0 of the 0 were scratched .
neutral	takes a lots of time to compile .
neutral	resultant photos acceptable , could be better .
neutral	the service works , the deal was alright but not the most competitive and i wish i tried another network now .
neutral	overall no real problems but nothing that makes me think they are amazing .
neutral	excellent service & delivery but coffee just doesn_'_t have the quality of taste .
neutral	ordered at approx mid day and arrived before mid day the following_day already restrung for me at my specifications .
neutral	very well_packaged and ready for me to use straight_away .
neutral	used before for shoes but never a racket and not very trusting with stringers as have had many bad restrings .
neutral	after having my racket for approx 0_weeks and only playing 0 competitive game and only 0 training_sessions the strings snapped during warm up for my 0nd competitive match , expected much more .
neutral	zapper is great if you have a load of old books that you '_ve read and no_longer need which are taking up space .
neutral	the collection drop_off point are close by .
neutral	but sadly out of the 0000 books that i own and urgently want rid of only 00 were accepted and it took me a whole day to enter all of the codes onto the zapper system .
neutral	then of course you have to find the right sized box and a roll of tape and then you have to weigh the box and measure it or it won_'_t meet the criteria .
neutral	so you need scales that read kg '_s .
neutral	i got my cheque ok about a week after i had posted the books out .
neutral	the next time i am just going to bag them up and recycle them as paper as its easier and you get the money in your hand right away .
neutral	they have a big product range and fair prices , but two out of three_times i '_ve_used the site , they have had to ring to say that they don_'_t have stock of an item , despite the site showing stock .
neutral	not the end of the world , but a pain if you could '_ve bought everything from somewhere_else with stock .
neutral	most frustrating however is the shipping - i think three shopping_experiences with them has given them a fair crack of the whip , but all three_times the goods have not been dispatched for at_least a day or two and then their fedex standard shipping , despite appearing to be a three day service , always takes much longer .
neutral	my most_recent order took five working_days from dispatch .
neutral	by contrast , nene overland had my order with me the next_day with their standard shipping .
neutral	come on paddock_spares , pull your finger out !
neutral	you '_ve got a great business , don_'_t let it down with weak back - end service .
neutral	lovely villa , but the description of wifi and satellite_tv is very misleading .
neutral	wifi was very important in our decision on where to stay and it was non_existent / useless .
neutral	there is satellite_tv , but apart_from bbcw there are no other english channels , which was not a problem for us , but could be for some !
neutral	donna the rep was magnificent .
neutral	the flowers were very well received but apparently thaey were just left dumped on the front_door and nobody rang the bell ?
neutral	?
neutral	i was recommended to use maxiraw about 00 months_ago and found the service to be excellent and the products to match .
neutral	the service is quick is easy and there are wide_range of quality products .
neutral	however , although all of the above hasn_'_t changed i am extremely disappointed you have stopped the loyalty_points_scheme on your website .
neutral	this was a great little feature and stood you out from the rest in a very competitive market !
neutral	to be honest i am the kind of person_who always goes for the best deal and maxi raw don_'_t seem to be able to offer me that anymore .
neutral	hopefully this can be changed spoon ......
neutral	very easy to deal with in terms of the process , however , they made up that there was a scratch on the phone ( which there wasn_'_t , i photographed it before sending off ) and reduced the payment by a massive 00 %.
neutral	taking the mickey somewhat but i just went with it for minimum hassle .
neutral	they did offer to send it back for free .
neutral	update_: 0jun00
neutral	after constant pestering by the company i feel obliged to reply .
neutral	the whole point of an independent review site is that a customer can score what they believe to be a fair representation of the company .
neutral	the " crack " on the bezel is perfect and straight , looks_like the intended " crack " on the iphone 0 ( see the antenna configuration ).
neutral	i believe it certainly comes under the " light cosmetic_wear and tear is acceptable " policy on your website .
neutral	another reason for not rating 0_stars is your policy on " automatic payment after 0 days " if the offer has_been revised .
neutral	i feel that this time period is too short if the customers best_interests are in mind .
neutral	" 0_stars : acceptable experience but with some friction ."
neutral	is a fair representation of this transaction .
neutral	i ordered a gopro from proviation however , due to lack of shipments from gopro i ultimately cancelled the order and requested a refund .
neutral	after a few troubles with my emails being sent to proviations ' spam ' folder ( so not getting replies ), the refund was issued along with friendly apologies .
neutral	proviation have done a lot to resolve this issue and i thank them greatly for it .
neutral	the experience of the return_journey was excellent with good service , comfort and food .
neutral	it made me realise that had the outbound_journey not been cancelled we would have enjoyed a relaxing and stress_free start to our holiday as_opposed to what happened .
neutral	the outbound_journey was cancelled following the ship sustaining damage after colliding with the dock .
neutral	the organisation at harwich was very poor with lack of information and delay .
neutral	while the harassed staff were doing their best they seemed to have no management support .. we caught a dfds_ferry from dover the following_day and whilst the staff were very helpful at dover they did not know we were coming which surprised me .
neutral	more annoying is that five weeks after i should have caught the ferry i am still_waiting for reimbursement of expenses and fare have driven an extra 000_miles in some very difficult conditions and missed a complete afternoon of our holiday which should have been sightseeing in ribe , denmark .
neutral	following a similar experience with brittany_ferries last_year due to industrial action my account was immediately credited with the fare ,.
neutral	petrol money and hotel expenses .
neutral	i expected the same from dfds .
neutral	while accidents_happen i believe some of the stress and problems could have been relieved by decisions having been made quicker , surely it must have been realised early on that the damage could not have been repaired that day .
neutral	we could have set off for dover much earlier as_opposed to leaving harwich at 0 . 00pm and having to stop half way .
neutral	so my opinion of dfds is tainted by my experience of what happens when things go_wrong and in my view the company needs to learn lessons and have contingency plans for when things do not go to plan .
neutral	waiting for hours with no information then having so few staff who had no support trying to explain to everyone the options was very poor service .
neutral	then to top it all i have had to write to dfds on my return from holiday to claim expenses and i am still_waiting !!!
neutral	the full details of our experience is outlined in my letter to dfds of 00th_july .
neutral	had we gone on the outbound_journey and if our experience had been similar to our return_journey then i would have rated 0_stars possibly even 0_stars .
neutral	however given the lack of organisation and delay in reimbursement i feel i can only click 0_stars .
neutral	i would have clicked 0_stars but the staff were trying very hard and maintained politeness in difficult circumstances and seem to be to well trained in customer service , it is a shame they were not better supported .
neutral	i obviously ordered a pair of hinges at the wrong time of year , it being christmas .
neutral	now 0 days have elapsed since ordering , and it '_s saturday so it will be monday at the earliest and 00 days , before arrival .
neutral	i have my fingers_crossed !
neutral	company made a fantastic next_day delivery promise which was unbelievable , unfortunately flowers were looking a little damaged on arrival , and even_though i had the room temperature water waiting , fed them with food provided , flowers did not respond , and after 0 days , they already looked ready for the compost .
neutral	they were a beautiful bunch of flowers and i could not fault anything_else , and would recommend this company .
neutral	i place many internet orders but i think that it was the bed pads - 0 washable and 00 disposables .
neutral	i haven_'_t tried either yet but it '_s true to state that they look as if they will be fit for purpose .
neutral	as i know so little about your company i feel that i should only give an average rating - i . e three stars .
neutral	there has certainly been no friction , but how can one give more stars on such scanty experience ?
neutral	good luck
neutral	terence
neutral	the initial purchase was very efficient received a used or otherwise poor quality item should have been shrink_wrapped record scuffed and sleeve damaged .
neutral	in process of returning so_far communications have been courteous and informative .
neutral	juno need to quality check what is being sent out so as not to put collectors off buying again
neutral	easy online ordering and a good choice of racks and other products .
neutral	was disappointed when the goods arrived as for two small storage racks i paid £_00 ( inc_vat ) for delivery and yet 0 of the uprights were just thrown in the delivery van with no protection on them , they were just taped_together at one end and in the middle with the kind of tape and labels that tears and leaves residue when you try to remove them .
neutral	as a result the uprights were marked but not quite badly enough for me to ask for a replacement .
neutral	also they have a free_gift system ( which is great ) but be careful - if you don_'_t fill in the code when checking out then you won_'_t get the free_gift !
neutral	nice bunch of roses ( got your prime quality ), but think it '_s overpriced .
neutral	may be that is because i am from nl , where flowers are way cheaper .
neutral	not happy with my order , the first pair had one bigger than the other even_though they had the same size on them .
neutral	sent them back with no_problems but new pair are exactly the same i feel like they weren_'_t checked went sent back and just turned around and sent out again .
neutral	am sending back again this time asking for a full_refund .
neutral	sorry .
neutral	when clicking " make payment " the booking threw me out to home page , then the second_attempt lost passengers , a conform booking email arrived but the link didn_'_t work .
neutral	finally_managed to get the booking made in summary , a bit of a nightmare , but at the price perseverance paid off .
neutral	after having booked a people carrier and having received a confirmation for it , on the day of the pick - uk i had a telephone_call saying that the vehicle was not available and that they would refund the full_amount .
neutral	i argued that at that stage it was too late and not good enough to simply cancel and refund .
neutral	they asked me to find a vehicle once i arrived at my location from a rental car company and that they would compensate for the cost .
neutral	again i argued that if they couldn_'_t find a vehicle for me , what were the chances of me finding one !
neutral	fortunately after a while on the phone they managed to find a suitable vehicle and it was ok .
neutral	i thought that this kind of service , if it didn_'_t end in the way it did , could be very distressing for anyone .
neutral	couldn_'_t download prescription as download memory not large enough , had to email and attach the prescription , then post the original .
neutral	once this done , tablets came within a couple of days .
neutral	well made pipe totally happy with the quality .. but its no where near as flexible as i expected
neutral	i had to return the boots i had ordered because they were so huge & heavy .
neutral	i then found out that the usual return system for the isle of man no_longer existed , which resulted_in my having to pay over £_00 to return them by post .
neutral	the lady i spoke to at easy wellies was very nice , but did not know why this had happened .
neutral	the subsequent boots i ordered are great , so i am very happy with my second order .
neutral	i just wish the web_site had been up to date regarding returns .
neutral	it was very irritating not being_able to find the information i needed on the site .
neutral	the expense of returning items has put me off using them again .
neutral	i could maybe write a review if i had been able to use the service on a website that was up and running , but due to problems outwith my control the site has taken over a week to go live .
neutral	ask me the question again when i have actualy got a site to do things with .
neutral	i checked my phone for value .
neutral	mazuma gave_me an instant price , which i was happy with .
neutral	i recieved packaging after registry about 0 days_later .
neutral	i then sent phone off in a box , which mazuma recieved .
neutral	now ive been waiting for a cheaque that was posted 0 days ago & i still_havent recieved it .
neutral	ill wait a few more days then contact them .
neutral	my part of the deal was quick , but payment is a different_story .
neutral	the post_office informed me that the package was not addressed properly .
neutral	the street name was omitted .
neutral	i paid for next_day delivery last sunday and finally took delivery this saturday .
neutral	when i called i was informed that the courier had tried to deliver but couldn_'_t i am not interested in these differing_opinions .
neutral	i didn_'_t get what i paid for in terms of delivery .
neutral	help_desk person not really that sympathetic - ie .
neutral	i was not there when it was supposed to have been delivered - my problem .
neutral	i had to call post_office to find out what had happened .
neutral	otherwise product as_described .
neutral	i have used speedgraphic before but would hesitate in the future .
neutral	cannot_comment on flowers as had them delivered 0 other end of the country .
neutral	the ordering_process was quick and easy however so really hope the flowers met with my expectations
neutral	quidco used to be a great cash - back site a few_years back but these days i find that payment seem to take a long time to clear and that certain retailers continue to stall payments 0 - 00 months and you have to chase them which becomes tiring very quickly , if they sorted these retailers out it would be back being a great site .
neutral	speedy delivery of my order was most welcome ........ the cumbersome approach to refunding vat for guernsey residents is not .
neutral	if you can improve this procedure so that is efficient and quick then my ranking of your service would have been 0_stars .
neutral	as things stand i am hesitant to repeat the experience as i am able to shop more efficiently elsewhere .
neutral	shame .
neutral	postage was expensive for a flute and i sent an email questioning this but never received a reply .
neutral	first time i '_ve_used the site .
neutral	good :
neutral	well_designed website with good filters / searching .
neutral	dispatched promptly .
neutral	bad :
neutral	the spark_plug set that i ordered , was very low quality .
neutral	as 0 of the plugs have broken their internal connector just taking them on and off twice .
neutral	whilst the price was good , i expect veewee to only sell quality items which this wasn_'_t . the case .
neutral	this makes me dubious of ordering further items .
neutral	i ending up using the plug connectors from my old set on their new leads .
neutral	couldn_'_t have been more helpful and the part was exactly_what i was looking for .
neutral	delivery was a let_down though - 0 days to arrive and then only came_across it atback door by chance - no communication from delivery company .
neutral	although the costume was delivered on time i felt the picture was better_than the goods and the material looked heavier_than the goods i received .
neutral	hi i have already filled a survey out telling villa_plus what went wrong with our holiday so why should i have relive it over and over again it was the most uncomfortable one we have had for years i know the villa was just somewhere to lay our heads but to lay them just about a foot ( 000_mm ) from the floor for people of our age it is not good so please do not send me any more emails asking me what m our holiday was like it was not the best we have had . the staff were good lanzarote great the villa '_s position nice the furnishing was crap in our opinion
neutral	r winfield
neutral	mmmm .. what game is this refering to ?
neutral	i bought the ' grande ' version and it turns_out that this is a little smaller than an average bunch that you would pick_up from tesco .
neutral	flowers were ok but there was too few .
neutral	it didnt look like the picture ( mcdonalds burger moment ) and the wrapping was poor .
neutral	i bought a masculine bunch and it came with a stupis little pink bow on the front , complimented by a barcode sticker and stems wrapped in cotton wool .
neutral	overall , this would be ok for a 00 year_olds birthday treat - not the burthday of a 00 yer old business man .
neutral	i chucked them and ordered from a same day florist .
neutral	i got a lovely_bunch bunch for twice the size at £ 0 more .
neutral	paid for next_day deliver and it was late resulting a failed mot due to a missing rear_bumper_protector .
neutral	good company , dropped the phone off to there office rather_than posting .
neutral	cheque received after after 0 attempts made by the company .
neutral	i ordered 0 records - this was my first order with juno having been recommended .
neutral	i then paid extra for next_day delivery - this was last wednesday .
neutral	when the records hadn_'_t arrived by the friday i phoned juno and spoke to a very helpful guy called andrew who investigated and then said that there had been a problem whereby they couldn_'_t tell whether the records had been despatched or not and therefroe couldn_'_t tell me what was happening with any certainty .
neutral	andrew apologised and said i would be given a full_refund and if by chance it transpired the records had been despatched and then belatedly arrived they would be mine to keep - this was a very nice_gesture and the full_refund hit my account yesterday .
neutral	the records have not shown up and so , although the way my query was dealt_with was excellent and apologetic , unfortunately i am not impressed as i bought the records as i needed them and haven_'_t got what i paid for .
neutral	the website '_s great to browse and when going to the store in person there are usually a few people around who know their stuff .
neutral	i was having trouble getting the website to deliver to an address other than my billing_address so i phoned up , spent about 0 minutes on hold , was given inaccurate advice on how to proceed , and then had to phone back again ( another 0 minutes on hold ).
neutral	they said it was an issue they were aware of and it was being worked on , but the first person i spoke to clearly wasn_'_t aware of it .
neutral	got free p_&_p to make up for it , but it was a bit shoddy .
neutral	i have no issues with the company or service , however the tickets i purchased had a face value of £_00 and had been sold to me at double that .
neutral	and with ticketmaster being an affiliated company you feel that they are block booking their own seats before the public have the chance to buy them and then selling them on at double the price to the customer , who has no option if they want the best seats .
neutral	it comes across as a bit of a cartel .
neutral	other than that no issues_whatsoever with the company or the service recieved .
neutral	i bought it over the phone and had great customer service , timely delivery .
neutral	the boots are really nice and warm , definitely waterproof .
neutral	however they will wound anybody ´_s heels , due to poor internal design in that area .
neutral	i glued some padding to each area and wear the boots comfortably now , i preferred not to return them because other than that the boots are great .
neutral	good website one of the best tile shop ones i '_ve seen , good product but delivery was 0 days_later than selected .
neutral	i have just returned from spain where i hired a chev aveo for two_weeks and thought i was getting a good deal .
neutral	however i left the car with a three quarter_tank and was charged e00 . 00 euro for fuel !!!!
neutral	that was more than 000 of the total hire charge which included insurance .
neutral	i understand i could have left an empty_tank , but who takes a chance with travelling on an empty_tank in a foreign_country .
neutral	the car_hire company was eurocar .
neutral	the fuel_tank has a capacity of 00 litres and at the cost of fuel in malaga at e0 . 000 per_litre - a full_tank of fuel on empty would have cost e00 euro .
neutral	i will never hire a car again on these terms .
neutral	i would not recommend this type of car_hire .
neutral	i hire_cars 0 to 0 times a year , guess_what a lost customer here >
neutral	ordered a bike ( didn_'_t ask foe bike to be built , just sent in original_packaging ) and other bits and requested next_day delivery , no info when ordering that bike would not be set next_day .
neutral	took day off , no delivery , took next_day off , still no delivery .
neutral	phoned up and was told that bike was not ready and that it should have said that bikes take longer as they needed to swap round brakes ( this was not on website ).
neutral	however they were good and sorted this out , arrived next_day .
neutral	if you order well_worth giving them a ring to make_sure when items will be delivered even if requesting next_day delivery .
neutral	will order from them in future but lesson_learnt :)
neutral	ordered a headset which on the site was showing in stock , expected shipping day came and went with no notification .
neutral	looked at web - site and saw item was out of stock - easy to guess_what had happened - they never had any .
neutral	two_days after expected delivery date and finally get an e_- mail asking me to call them .
neutral	so i called and was told that there was none left and they weren_'_t expecting any so will issue a refund .
neutral	i feel they could '_ve been more on the ball and identified this much sooner saving me a week without a much needed headset which i '_ve sourced elsewhere .
neutral	i think it was my fault really , i thought i was getting two good deals , when only one was good .
neutral	if i were to order again i would be more careful .
neutral	as i have bought several gtech products it would be quite helpful to know which one you want a review for .
neutral	we purchased an adjustable foot_stool which was promptly dispatched .
neutral	the stool was quite poorly_finished with sharp corners , in fact my wife cut her foot on one of the corners .
neutral	it was not worth sending back and i smoothed it off .
neutral	with a bit more thought it could have been made with rounded_corners .
neutral	when folded one of the metal struts protrudes slightly again poor construction / design .
neutral	it is a shame as with a bit more thought it could have been excellent .
neutral	quality of doors is good , however 0 failed delivery dates and numerous phone_calls to sort_out .
neutral	delivery contractor does not seem to care about customer requests or agreed requirements .
neutral	would recommend products but not the pathetic delivery service .
neutral	we planted 00 seeds and 00 popped not bad , not great
neutral	i ordered single_vision reading_glasses and expected to get them within the week , but it was nearly two_weeks until they came .
neutral	the glasses themselves are fine .
neutral	i usually browse the wine shops not the net but i found a " poire william " liqueur i had not seen before , punt e mes which very few stock and a 0000 vintage single estate port which read well on research .
neutral	unfortunately the cork in the port was completely dried out and crumbled on opening , " poor cellar or slow seller " .
neutral	too much hassle to argue over less_than £_00 , returning open bottle etc .
neutral	the biggest problem with online shopping , to my mind .
neutral	will not bother again .
neutral	impressed with car and general overall service but as expected with most rental_companies nowadays fuel_policy is a rip_off .
neutral	they charge you an exorbitant amount for a full_tank of fuel and tell you to bring it back empty .
neutral	would like to know what percentage of people are able to return a car completely empty .
neutral	obviously you return your car with let '_s say a 0 / 0 of a tank left , if your lucky , it cost the rental company 00_euros to refill but the next customer gets charged 000_euros which is the cost of a full_tank , profit profit profit on top of what it costs to rent in the first place .
neutral	also be aware of the insurance scam , prepaid insurance doesn_'_t cover everything and you will pay again on pick_up .
neutral	unfortunately i think most companies are doing this now so all as bad as each other but gold car were generally good apart_from the above .
neutral	quick response on direct email but slow in shipments and updates about the order status .
neutral	poorly_packed with a lot of tape and damaged package .
neutral	it was clearly already opened and one item was missing .
neutral	i had booked renault_clio or similar as a ' 0_seater ' for possible carriage of brother in law and wife and mother in law if necessary .
neutral	on arrival 00 . 00am arrival in poland after 0 . 00 am departure from home in uk offered suzuki_swift .
neutral	as on rush to hospital to see mother in law , didn_'_t pick_up that it was the group below , as not mentioned by budget staff .
neutral	distracted by discrepancy_between 0 supposed bumper edge marks on yellow carbon copy not matching up to 0 on actual vehicle in foul_weather ( went back to tell staff , but already left in less_than 00_minutes ), so could not pursue .
neutral	we ordered a wrist_support in the wrong_size and removed it from the sealed packet before realising .
neutral	sent it back with a explanation .
neutral	if it could not be repackaged and replaced with the right size it would be nice to be told that rather_than just be ignored .
neutral	the buying process was good but was disappointed in the colour of the item .
neutral	it was described as yellow , but is actually orange .
neutral	i have no time to return and wait for the yellow item described .
neutral	nice and easy to order from the website , lots of communication including one to say your order has left the building and is on route , 00_hours_later it turned_up at 0pm .
neutral	sorry but i wasn_'_t made aware it would be delivered so late , if i had i would have got them a day earlier .
neutral	but to be fair , beautiful_flowers at the end .
neutral	i bought from the website and when i received the wii and what was supposed to be 0 games , instead i got a wii that was damaged on the back which was not in the description and i only received one game and not too , so not very pleased since this is ment for someone_else as a christmas_present : s
neutral	i have ordered from you guys for some years_now but the last 0 orders i '_ve placed have been delayed , my most_recent one coming up close on 0 week and whilst i can appreciate you do run out of stock , this isn_'_t reflected on your site nor is it indicated there could be a delay .
neutral	i found the service given by furniture @ work to be very good .
neutral	the staff were pleasant , the products that i ordered were in stock and the delivery was right on time but one of the boxes must have taken a bash at some point .
neutral	i noticed , after the shipment was signed for , that the leg of one chair had broken through the box and was slightly_scuffed .
neutral	when i assembled the chair , i also found that one of the leather arm rest pads had broken off .
neutral	i expect that furniture @ work would have replaced this if i had complained but i needed this chair so i glued this pad back on to save the hassle of returning it ( seems to have worked ok ).
neutral	i think this is more a fault with the shipping company than furniture @ work .
neutral	i would use furniture @ work again and recommend them to friends but i would also recommend they carefully check the packaging and do not accept it if it '_s damaged .
neutral	good quality product which arrived on time .
neutral	yep a bright_orange bag with super_dry all over it sure does spoil a christmas_present comming in the post . maybe you should offer discreet_packaging . fast delivery and great product though
neutral	good customer service just never take out o0 insurance hard to find there number and impossible to make a claim
neutral	acceptable experience but with some friction
neutral	just like online_retailers , you need to be careful what you buy .
neutral	high price does not mean high_quality !
neutral	great tool for finding ideas and pricing !
neutral	every review i read about currys is bad , they all say the same , unhelpful staff , staff have no knowledge of the products they sell etc , in my experience i have never had a problem with currys except for bad delivery .
neutral	ordered a tv from them and was told it would take 0_weeks to deliver even_though their site and tv_ads say next_day delivery .
neutral	the member of staff was pretty helpful in telling_me what the tvs had and which ones were the best .
neutral	i usually know exactly_what i want from currys so have only had to ask for advice a couple of times .
neutral	i bought a sidelight bulb_holder , weighing about an_ounce in old currency , or about 00 gramms . it arrived in a simple jiffy_bag , for which i was charged £ 0 postage .
neutral	i buy heavy books from amazon , and only pay £ 0 . 00 postage , so just_kampers are , in my opinion , making excessive profit on their postage_charges .
neutral	the charge levied should cover their costs , no more
neutral	the ferry itself and the crossing was faultless but the food being breakfast was disgusting and on the verge of unedible , was stone cold when served but when cooked was burnt to a crisp , the price would of been ok if it had been cooked properly and nice but it so wasnt it was foul , shame as it meant on our way back we ate before getting on the ferry !
neutral	i found the site and the tyre easily but when i tried to go through the process the site does not work properly when you select a branch .
neutral	i knew the branch i wanted , selected it , but couldn_'_t proceed to checkout until i realised it didn_'_t work without the postcode .
neutral	i nearly just walked_away from the order when i went round and round a few_times .
neutral	it needs fixing
neutral	i ordered my pc on 0th_january_0000 via the website and it arrived on 00 january_0000 so just outside the 0 week lead time mentioned on their website so not too bad , it came with all the correct components , the oem windows 0 disk and the graphics_card box + drivers so no_problems there !
neutral	however , when i tried to contact them to find out when the order would be dispatched ( after the 0 week deadline had passed ) it took three_attempts on different days and waiting an average of 00_minutes before anyone picked_up the telephone , i also sent 0 emails and got no response .
neutral	i think this company is basically sound but when you hand over several_hundred_pounds it does make you sweat a little when you cannot get hold of a human_being , customer service needs some working on and then they would be a great little company and no doubt pick_up far more business !
neutral	that '_s it really .
neutral	rest is good .
neutral	i bought a pc in april last_year from dino_pc and it is still going_strong with no_problems .
neutral	other people said that they have experienced problems with theirs but these are just random people who might be making it up .
neutral	that is why i left it some time to do a review .
neutral	either way my pc is working great .
neutral	the only problem was the customer service and the guarantee .
neutral	they were quick to respond to quires through emails but had no contact_numbers .
neutral	they still owe me £ 0 from a voucher that i used but they did not deduct from the price when i paid for it .
neutral	the 0 year_guarantee was a bit_dodgy as i had to pay for the parts but not the labour .
neutral	other than that this was a good place to get a pc from .
neutral	just do not expect any niceties / customer service
neutral	sadly had to send shoes back they hurt my foot across thetoe area not heard a word from anyone sent a week_ago do i get money back orwill someone call me ????
neutral	ken c oad coadspeed @_btinternet . com
neutral	i ordered a part listed for my machine wahine after discussing it with a member of staff .
neutral	when it arrived it didn_'_t fit .
neutral	however they quickly sent me the returns details and hopefully i will get a refund soon !
neutral	i like the idea behind westin gormet and the service is very good , but have some reservations_about the standard of the meat when words like ' premium ' and ' restaurant quality ' are used .
neutral	the bacon exudes water and white scum typical of eu bacon pumped_full of water and additives .
neutral	unlike the more strictly controlled british bacon .
neutral	the first of my rump_steaks had a lump of gristle at one end that i would question demonstrates a top quality cut .
neutral	i will buy from them in future but i will be comparing the meat against that from my local_supermarkets first .
neutral	i googled caa easa atpl licence cover and i ordered the item on the page shown in my web_browser .
neutral	i was therefore surprised to receive the larger cover .
neutral	the web_page did not provide any dimensions of the item or offered any alternative cover .
neutral	i have returned the cover but have not yet received the item i wanted .
neutral	i have had good service and experience with sportsbikeshop .
neutral	however on this occasion the helmet i ordered arrived promptly and received in a nice outer_box .
neutral	when i opened up the box the contents were nicely_packed , took the motorcycle_helmet box out and it was horribly damaged .
neutral	odd since the outer_box had no marks at all .
neutral	took the helmet out and was missing the throat wind shield and scuffs inside the box .
neutral	it appears it was packed away in this condition with a broken helmet box since the outer_box was unmarked .
neutral	arranged_collection with customer_services very cooperative and pragmatic .
neutral	dhl however seem a little inflexible i must_say .
neutral	was pleased with delivery etc .
neutral	the quality of flowers was not that great .
neutral	they did not look very fresh .
neutral	went home last night and my wife had thrown them out .
neutral	the flowers were smelling and some of them were completely withered .
neutral	after 0 days that is not acceptable .
neutral	had i bought from the garage would have expected that .
neutral	first and last time i will use them
neutral	the small hook magnets are disappointing as they don_'_t seem to hold that good not like the large one wish we never brought them and stuck with the larger ones
neutral	filling out numerous forms , just to send a single parcel took over 00_mins and then its tries to add hated 00p supplements for using paypal or a credit_card to pay .
neutral	when will companies realise that these extra_charge scams just prevent people using them again and cost them business ?
neutral	took me less_than 0 minutes to select and but the tyre online but over an_hour at the fitting_centre :-(
neutral	the sunglasses i recieved did not have the extra set of lenses as advertised .
neutral	i complained about this to the nice and helpful cutomer service .
neutral	they admitted their mistake and offered either to pay for my expenses in returning my glsses or to sell a set of extra lenses to me at full price .
neutral	i did not want to pay full price for an extra set of lenses , and returned my sunglasses .
neutral	ideally they should have given me a pair of lenses as it was their mistake .
neutral	at_least i think they should have given me a discount on the lenses , which they would / could not .
neutral	that being said the customer service agents were very nice and responded quickly .
neutral	generally easy to use website but updating info requires you to re - start all over again and ferry timings not always obvious at the start of a process - a simple timetable for each ferry or ferry company would make life_easier
neutral	but overall not bad and have used them a few_times as it seems easier than soem of the competitors
neutral	i have ordered previoulsy from liberro , i was sent an email from them with a discount_voucher_code to use on my next order . 00_% voucher which i used
neutral	i went on to the web to place another order some months later , but did not complete the transaction .
neutral	at the time i needed the product urgently but did not agree wiht the postage_costs i was to incur , so i left the items in my shopping_cart but logged off .
neutral	i then got another email from liberro giving me another discount_voucher_code , so this time i went in and placed an order and when checking out entered the voucher number as emailed to me , however i was advised online that the voucher was not valid !
neutral	so missed out on a 00_% saving .
neutral	i reckon it is to do with me already using a voucher_code for 00_%, but if you can only use the voucher once !
neutral	then my question is why did i get sent another email a month or so later with another voucher_code ?
neutral	so the reason for the low rating is purley to do with me not getting the 00_%_discount that i thought i wouldf get ....
neutral	anyway the order was placed i paid the full_amount for my order and i got the goods in the time period expected ,
neutral	disappointed with the way your company has advertised on line price '_s , you advertise price at £_00 . 00 went into book after filling out my details and price went up to £_00 . 00 , false_advertising if you ask me
neutral	whilst holidayautos booking process works really well it is important to fully understand the contract with the car_hire company .
neutral	on this occasion the 000_euro_deposit stated on my confirmation became a 0000 euro_deposit when i arrived at gold car in rome ..... that '_s their requirement for the class of car we hired .
neutral	also i had to take gold car '_s inflexible ' flexible fuel ' policy ... take the car full and return it empty and pay their high fuel price and a compulsory refuelling charge of 00_euros .
neutral	the wording in my confirmation wasn_'_t absolutely clear and gold car would not allow me to take the car full and return it full .
neutral	also the transfer service for gold car at fiumicino is a nightmare , 0_seater minibuses and a scrum to get on one competing with parkinggo car_park clients .... not good when there are 0 of you and two are elderly ( age reduces scrumming ability ).
neutral	on the positive_side gold car provided us with a brand_new car and refunded the unused_fuel .
neutral	still_haven_'_t receive delivery after 0 working_days but the support_team have been very helpful and explained what could have caused delays and the latest i can expect delivery .
neutral	also told me they will resolve if not delivered , very helpful
neutral	i ordered a dressing_table stool for a christmas_gift for my wife as it looked perfect to finish off our bedroom_suite .
neutral	the good news is when the product finally arrived it was of excellent quality and just what i expected .
neutral	the bad_news was the fiasco with reagrds to delivery of this item .
neutral	i was asked which day i wanted delivery and arranged for my wife to take a day off work to accept this delivery .
neutral	despite staying in all day nothing arrived .
neutral	i rang the office at 0 . 00pm and was advised that the item was out for delivery but as they were using a 0rd_party courier it wasn_'_t trackable but should arrive that day still .
neutral	however the delivery didn_'_t show up so after a telephone_conversation the next_morning i was assured that the problem was just the amount of xmas deliveries and that the delivery would be made that day .
neutral	this time my son waited in all day with no delivery being made - once again i rang and was told that the delivery was not being made due to xmas .
neutral	this time i was guaranteed that the delivery would definitely be made the next_day ( 00rd ) before_noon .
neutral	noon came and went and i tried_calling again .
neutral	once again i was told that the delay was due to the xmas_rush but that the delivery would definitely be made that day .
neutral	well surprise surpise it wasn_'_t !!
neutral	three_days on the trot people had to stay in and three_times we were let_down which i found very frustrating .
neutral	my furniture finally arrived at 0 . 00am on christmas_eve , 0 days_later than agreed .
neutral	so to rate furniture_market ;
neutral	0 ) good customer service 0 / 00
neutral	0 ) good quality product 0 / 00
neutral	0 ) delivery company they use 0 / 00
neutral	chilli_sauce got a few things right over the 0 nights we spent in hamburg : the hotel was comfortable though the breakfast was lacking and the transfers between airports and activities were a nice feature ( though also lacked consistency across activities or in arriving on time ).
neutral	the taxi for our return to the airport had to be called as it didn_’_t arrive and the response of the phone was “ is it not there already ?” - not what i call a vote of confidence .
neutral	on the day that we went paintballing one taxi arrived at the venue 00 - 00_minutes before the other despite setting off second .
neutral	the traditional 0 course german meal was in fact 0 course with 0 small beers and though the beer allowance was made clear to us straight_away the staff at the restaurant , the fact that we were only having one ( good but small ) meal was not .
neutral	the paintballing was outdoor rather_than indoor with 00_euros extra costs each for an overall and enough paintballs to last everyone the games .
neutral	it is very relaxed though and much_better_than in england .
neutral	would definitely go back .
neutral	the go_karting was an excellent activity !
neutral	we raced in 0 sets of 0 with a short practise , qualifying and then approximately 00 laps on a 00 - 00 second / lap track .
neutral	you get a print out at the end detailing your performance .
neutral	the beer bike was hard work but a lot of fun .
neutral	the driver was informative and the tour substantial with 0 - 0 breaks .
neutral	the beer was cleary cheap but acceptable and ( due to temperature ) took somebody working the tap the whole time to get anything but foam into the glasses .
neutral	the night time tour that we went on with a local guide was excellent too .
neutral	we were accepted into bars we were not previously allowed into due to guest lists .
neutral	once into these it is important to behave appropriately as the staff are very apprehensive of groups of british men and will have you removed for as little as spilling your drink .
neutral	i would suggest that you get a map and try and see as much during the day as possible .
neutral	from st pauli where our hotel was , we were one corner from altona train_station and you can get tickets for the s - bahn “ fast train ” for very cheap .
neutral	i suggest visiting the aussenalster and the area around the hauptbahnhopf if you get chance .
neutral	orderd the ticket and waited .
neutral	i did like the reassurance that it would be with me soon delivered by ups .
neutral	that was good from viagogo i liked the reassurance .
neutral	unfortunately the ticket never came and i got a link for the eticket .
neutral	so why did i pay almost a tenner for a ups delivery that didn_'_t ever happen ???
neutral	got to the gig fine and the eticket was fine just didn_'_t need the stress or the wast of 0 of my days off spent sitting in the house waiting for a ticket to be delivered .
neutral	the towing electrical upgrade supplied for my 0000 vw_passat is of the highest_quality .
neutral	but i was charged extra for fitting as i was a long way away , but as fortune would have it i had to travel north on business so arranged to meet fitter and have job_done near oxford instead of ramsgate , kent .
neutral	got no thanks for that , no reduction on cost , the panel under dashboard was not refitted correctly and got left with a fault light on dashboard which i had to pay another garage to clear .
neutral	i was not best pleased .
neutral	once fault light was reset all works well with no further problems .
neutral	i can not fault the service that you give to actual customers but i do not agree that you only will give discount to a customer that shops on your online store but not to a customer that shops on your e / bay site to which i got my first item from .
neutral	e / bay it came with a 0 %_discount card so i decided to send for the item again using e / bay thinking i would get the item discounted but not to be .
neutral	i sent a message about this but all i got from you sorry can only used on our online store .
neutral	surely if and items bought on e / bay by customer and have a discount card this should be passed on to that customer most items are paid via pay / pal and can reimburse discounts via pay / pal i know this can be done because i have had postage and even full refunds sent back to me via pay / pal and monies transferred back into to my bank_account .
neutral	most of my shopping is done on e / bay and the discount 0 %_off your next purchase !
neutral	* in big orange letters then small letters for when you order online at : bla_bla_bla this dose not exactly jump out in your face .
neutral	i just reordered via e / bay and did not know at the time this was a high_street outlet .
neutral	going back to the card in question perhaps the wording needs revamping to make the customer more aware something on the lines like this discount card and codes only apply at our online store and not through other_outlets
neutral	i ordered some garden shoes .
neutral	i had to make a couple of changes to my order due to an error on my part .
neutral	trying to get hold of the person dealing_with my order was very difficult and no - one else seemed willing or able to help .
neutral	despite messages being left and emails being sent i had to chase up my queries a number of times .
neutral	in addition i was told that the shoes would be delivered on a particular day by email only to find that the seller did not even have them in stock on that day .
neutral	it is a good job i work from home as otherwise i would have had to wait around at home for a non - existent delivery .
neutral	all in all not a happy experience .
neutral	i like these watches .
neutral	small , comfortable and properly waterproof enough to wear in the sea .
neutral	sadly their battery_life seems twitchy .
neutral	the last one i had reset itself several_times times and the replacement i was offered has lasted only a few_months before the display has begun to fade .
neutral	annoying .
neutral	ok site could be a little better layout
neutral	the ideal scenario would have been that the flowers turned_up at my wife '_s work early in the day and they would have been on display on her desk for the day for all to see .
neutral	however as she finishes work on friday at 0 : 00 i called her just before that and asked if anything notable had happened that day .
neutral	she said no so i knew that they had not been delivered yet .
neutral	i had to tell her that i had arranged for flowers to be delivered and could she hang on there at work whilst i try and find out where they were .
neutral	whilst i was trying to make contact to find where they were they arrived at 0 : 00 .
neutral	she did get them and liked them but the edge was lost due to the lateness .
neutral	as this was not mothers_day or valentines_day i would have expected a much earlier delivery .
neutral	flowers and chocs were appreciated but shame it was spoiled a bit but the lateness .
neutral	i like jules_b shopping online is easy and the deliveries is quick , i can tell my friends to shop on jules_b online
neutral	i used to send loads through tge , they were great , reliable and very cheap .
neutral	parcel to malta delivered next_day for just £_00 !!
neutral	now though the prices have increased to a level above others .
neutral	shame .
neutral	only issues i ever had were post delivery charges .
neutral	they would argue the size against the ones you enter and ask for a picture of the unopened parcel for proof !
neutral	after the 0th time this happened i changed to another company .
neutral	firstly , the web_site : why does it take so long to load ??
neutral	argh !
neutral	secondly : a few_times now i have had e_- mails from pm saynig that they are have charged me an extra amount as my parcel was found to be over the size i stated .
neutral	including one to brazil that incurred an extra_charge of £_00 !
neutral	when i agrued the point with them i got an_apology and my money back .
neutral	however , this happens a lot with pm and i do feel that they just try it on .
neutral	also , why do they feel they can just take the money off you before telling you they are going to do it ?
neutral	on the plus_side , i have found the customer_support for issues pretty good and they are very well priced for international_deliveries
neutral	firstly : this is not a wholly negative_review .
neutral	they are superb at providing really good delivery rates for large parcels that other will not even quote for .
neutral	once the parcel is collected the service is good .
neutral	however .
neutral	collections are a nightmare !
neutral	every time i use them i have to chase for at_least 0 days to get the collection done .
neutral	always apologetic and polite responses but really , please , just sort_out city_link and get them to collect on the day they are supposed to !!
neutral	oh , also , one city_link driver showed up , made a real fuss about the size of the parcel then commented " well , i hope it '_s not fragile " my partner pointed_out to him the 0 miles of fragile_tape on it at that point .
neutral	the parcel arrived damaged !
neutral	parcel link are good as a coureir booking company but city_link are not as good !
neutral	!
neutral	i was not happy with the speed my order was dealt_with
neutral	promised delivery was00 hrs late
neutral	the only problem stoping me giving it 0_stars is the machine leaks efluid into mouth quiet often
neutral	they are good for games but not for pre ordering as you don_'_t get the key in time which is frustrating for youtuber like me
neutral	first time i have used homebase in this way , used to have a shop just down the road but it got knocked down and an ikea is going to be put up in its place .
neutral	anyway , back to homebase ......
neutral	ordered on thursday with a confirmed delivery for friday , got to about 0pm on friday and no sign so called them , very helpful lady answered the phone but all she could tell me was that there was no scheduled delivery for me today , said it would probably be delivered tomorrow , what saturday !
neutral	anyhow , she said she would get her colleague to call me and let_me know on saturday .
neutral	saturday came , text from delivery company ( yodel ) telling_me my delivery was out on a van and the times it would arrive by , and yes surprise_surprise a knock at the door and my order was delivered , then the phone rang and it was homebase saying my order would be delivered !
neutral	and to top it all off they refunded the delivery charge .
neutral	so , initially thought - here we go again but homebase redeemed_themselves , sorry though only 0_stars as the delivery was a day late .
neutral	the initial_contact with the support_team was very good .
neutral	i had a problem with my login where i could not login , but neither could i obtain a new password or get the system to recognise me to do this even_though i have registered and at one of the stages it is obvious that i have been recognised .
neutral	the support person i spoke to sent me a copy of my bill ( which i was attempting to access with difficulty ) and promised to chase up a rectification of my account login and the let_me know when it was fixed ( expected to be 0 working_days .
neutral	no contact was made after 0 days and so a chase e_- mail was sent , with no response .
neutral	it would be good to know the current_status and when a fix is likely .
neutral	the idea is good and works well , but the final_outcome was not ideal
neutral	we are pleased with our purchase but hope the smell inside dries out .
neutral	hope wood has_been seasoned properly .
neutral	also , the delivery men had no_intention of taking the boxes upstairs .
neutral	they said they would not go up and kept banging against wall and banister to prove their point .
neutral	this was absurd as we have had a bigger wardrobe taken up before and two men did not mark or touch the wall or banister at all .
neutral	all in the willingness i '_m afraid .
neutral	we got them to stop as they would have caused lots of damage to decor otherwise .
neutral	disappointed in attitude .
neutral	it took like 0 phone_calls for them to actually give me a valid code .. but it eventually worked .
neutral	so i guess it was ok
neutral	i '_ve read a lot of awful reviews here .
neutral	i '_ve had a webiste with wix . com for about 0 months and it has_been working quite well .
neutral	i was with webs . com before and believe , wix . com are much_better and much more reliable !
neutral	i haven_'_t noticed that my website was down during those 0 months , the apps / widgets are working fine but there '_s 0 thing that kills me :
neutral	you can '_t use your hosted space as you wish !!!!!
neutral	which means that when you upload an image , you can '_t get the direct link of it , that means that you can '_t upload any files you want ( which is really stupid ) etc ...
neutral	so the space allocated to you for your uploads is pretty_much useless !
neutral	that drives me crazy !
neutral	it is such a stupid approach for a website builder , i can '_t believe this .
neutral	i have decided to pay monthly for now , even_though it '_s more_expensive than paying yearly , because i want to make_sure that this is worth my money .
neutral	it '_s not quite yet , but it '_s much_better_than my past experiences .
neutral	great to be able to order fantastic deals but when the sizes of the clothes are terribly poor , the items have to be returned using royal_mail and no clear and easy process .
neutral	the is especially annoying when the sizing of the products are way out from what is offered and the cost is absorbed by the customer
neutral	the item was ordered 0 days ago .
neutral	three_days ago i received a text_message advising it would be delivered in 00_hours .
neutral	i am still_waiting for it .
neutral	had i known it was going to be so difficult i would have driven to the store and collected it myself .
neutral	my compliant and opinions are contained in my 0 / 0 / 00 letter to country_attire ltd . their service was not satisfactory to me .
neutral	this was further demonstrated to me when they told me they could not replace an item ( after a 0 week delay ) because they would get no further supplies from the manufacturer therefore refunded my payment .
neutral	( order no .
neutral	000000000 ) so 0_weeks after i placed my order they told me i could not get what i wanted !
neutral	i contacted the supplier yesterday and received notification that the goods were in the post which i will bet the next_day .
neutral	why did i waste my time and effort buying a quality product from the middleman ?
neutral	some of their products are lower priced than other_places , but not all the time .
neutral	the shipping rates are way too high !
neutral	sometimes their lower priced product combined with the high shipping rate is still cheaper_than the competition , but again , not always , it depends on the product .
neutral	sw '_s shipping rate increases as more items ( weight ) are added .
neutral	i buy from prosource . net as well and their ups ship rate is $ 0 . 00 no matter the weight or how many items are added .
neutral	i just bought 00lbs of protein from ps and with their $ 0 . 00 ship rate total was $_00 .
neutral	a similar brand at sw was more exp and their ship rate was over $_00 , totalling $_000 .
neutral	even with their price match , total would be $_000 .
neutral	but the no0 i bought from sw was much_cheaper_than prosource , even with the high shipping cost , still beat ps buy $_00 .
neutral	so sometimes its a good deal , other times not , so shop around and compare , delivery time took 0 or 0 days , nothing special there .
neutral	found the goods .
neutral	00_% more_expensive than promised but since i was unable to wait i went_ahead with the purchase .
neutral	all went fine until i tried to use paypal from here in australia and your connection was rejected .
neutral	had to use my card instead which was disappointing .
neutral	other than that the communications went fine and everything arrived intact and on time .
neutral	i ordered a waistcoat and when it arrived the quality was pretty poor .
neutral	some say you get what you pay for and in this case it is true .
neutral	the waistcoat is a bit cheap and cheerful .
neutral	website seems packed full of really cool_stuff !
neutral	decent prices too
neutral	i '_ve been using lovefilm for several_years , and have been generally very pleased with the service .
neutral	the major problem with lovefilm is that they are unable to offer many of the titles from universal studios .
neutral	for that reason alone i have just switched to blockbuster online .
neutral	bought the car back and tried to charge me for a scratch that was noted on collection , however they apparently had lost the documents from when we collected the car , lady_who dealt_with me was very pleasant but kept saying not my fault someone must had lost the paperwork ,
neutral	this is the 0th time i have used autoeurope but the only time there has_been an issue
neutral	at the beginning of this week i was asked by this website for a review of my experience in dealing for the first time , as a new customer , with healthy_supplies .
neutral	i understand this review request was made with the awareness or authority of the company to enable them to understand what customers actually experienced from the transaction ( s ).
neutral	given the various messages posted here from the company to my feedback and my subsequent replies , i have chosen to re - establish the position , without emotion and without using anything which is defamatory .
neutral	note i have not used defamatory statements about the company or anyone in it and all of my comments were fair , balanced and factual given the information i had at the time each was made .
neutral	at the time of my feedback i had returned an unwanted item after it was delivered and at that time i purchased another ( replacement ) product from the same company .
neutral	the returned item was sent first_class with royal_mail on the 00st_january_0000 , the day after it arrived with me albeit the company claim it wasn_'_t received until the 00st_october , 00 days after it was posted , confirmed by my receipt .
neutral	i didn_'_t challenge when it was received , although i note it was a number of days prior to the request i had to make any comments .
neutral	at the time i was asked for my feedback i had not had any feedback from the company that the goods had been received by them or that the credit had been arranged .
neutral	at that point in time , with no information from the company and no credit in the account , i submitted a fair , factual appraisal of the experience i had .
neutral	my main initial comment was that :
neutral	" the company is fast at charging for sales but slow to repay credits .
neutral	the dampens the enthusiasm to continue trading with them , given that other on - line suppliers are much_faster at handling credits ."
neutral	i was surprised that the company chose to openly respond on the internet with a defamatory comment that i had lied in my initial comment .
neutral	after this defamatory comment had been posted on - line , the company then changed it to " not quite true ".
neutral	for some reason the company then changed it to " not true " with the word " quite " removed .
neutral	the approach by the company to open state here that my experience included " a lie " is unacceptable and defamatory particularly given it hadn_'_t provided any facts about having received the goods prior to the request for my feedback .
neutral	the advice i have received is that the initial comment mr fernandes had used stating i had used a " lie ", amended to " not quite true " and then further amended to " not true " remains defamatory .
neutral	a reasonable person would recommend mr fernandes seeks legal opinion should he decide to enable any defamatory comments not to be fully retracted and an_apology issued .
neutral	i also note there has_been no communication from the company other than in response to my comments regarding the feedback on my experience on here , ( in response to their request for feedback ).
neutral	i also not that the message i left on their answering_machine at 00 . 00 on the 0th_february_0000 failed to result in my call being returned as requested .
neutral	i note that this morning , for the first time , the credit due was paid into my bank_account .
neutral	i am consider how i , as what was a " new " customer , have been left troubled by the way the company has engaged with me , in particular in respect of the defamatory comments , especially given my professional reputation and standing .
neutral	i '_ve sent more than 00 parcels now and to say my confidence has_been knocked is an_understatement , smokers paradise in luton litterally throw / drop your parcels to the ground i '_m just lucky i have only been sending lite non fragile items .
neutral	customers should be allowed to submit feedback re agents handling of their goods .
neutral	i was hoping , as a first purchase , to be pleased but the loo roll holder was a little disappointing .
neutral	it was very light and insubstantial and when fitted was not at 00_degrees to the wall as expected .
neutral	on closer_inspection the angle of the moulding was about 00_degrees .
neutral	it only cost about 00 pounds so i can '_t be_bothered to return it .
neutral	i was going to order a shower cabinet but am a little_apprehensive .
neutral	i paid extra to receive my shoes in 0 days .
neutral	i have ordered monday_morning and friday is the due delivery date .
neutral	i noticed the shoes were only sent to the courier service on the 00th when i ordered on the 00th .
neutral	why pay extra ?
neutral	i could send a parcel home to dublin in less time and not using a courier .
neutral	they have a good selection of shoes so will probably use again but will not order something i intend wearing at the end of the week .
neutral	thanks for your response .
neutral	terms and conditions or not it is still very slow .
neutral	i bought a shirt and jeans at the same time as ordering the shoes from you and as i did not need them to wear out this weekend i did not pay extra for delivery and got standard delivery .
neutral	they both arrived yesterday and i '_m still_waiting for yours after paying a courier service fee .
neutral	reading through other reviews your delivery service needs to be improved .
neutral	and even if i paid for next_day delivery as you mentioned it would still take three_days as it takes two for you to send them to the courier .
neutral	great game and great service only problem was the bruce lee pre order code i received did not work
neutral	very strange .
neutral	order made , had to chase several days_later .
neutral	told that the box was damaged but the product fine .
neutral	then phoned at the last_minute to say it was a factory refurbished printer .
neutral	said no as this is an expensive piece of kit and i need to be able to rely_on it .
neutral	lost a week of time as a consequence , hence the three star_rating - which some might see as generous !
neutral	i recently_purchased some titleist dt solo golf_balls .
neutral	a decent ball but not too expensive when sending them for a swim in the numerous water hazards at my club .
neutral	no complaint about service and delivery but the balls i pruchased were clearly_marked as the new dt solo .
neutral	the picture on screen has new written on the top left hand_corner of the box .
neutral	when i received the balls , this logo was not on any of the boxes an it looks_like i have received the old version .
neutral	a bit mis_- leading i feel .
neutral	unexplained delay in delivering my first order .
neutral	no response to my email but medication eventually arrived .
neutral	ffx can help you if you do get in a flap but be careful .
neutral	they don_'_t always describe things as they actually are .
neutral	the brass flap i have received from them is excellent quality but not exactly as their spokesperson described .
neutral	he was asked does any of the part go inside the hole cut in the door .
neutral	he said no but he is wrong and that is incorrect .
neutral	i am now faced with a difficult job of increasing the hole in the door to accommodate the part of the flap which goes inside .
neutral	had i known this i may not have bought it .
neutral	took too long to get to me via germany and the delivery was missing a speak plug .
neutral	i '_ve also emaild the info emial adrress about the missing plug but i '_ve not heard_anything either .
neutral	so not great i '_m afraid !
neutral	all in a great deal and prompt service from the company .
neutral	the only_downside through them is their aftersales email service .
neutral	i had an issue with my phone and emailed them for a follow_up .... of which i am still_awaiting a reply and that is now 0_weeks .
neutral	i was able to sort my issue out through my main provider , however i feel the 0rd_party company should at_least have communicated back to me , at_least for just a follow_up to see how i got on or if the issue still_exists .
neutral	was on a fixed one year contract for electric .
neutral	had to give notice in writing that i wanted to switch so thank good did this by email and got a confirmation .
neutral	guess_what signed_up with a cheaper supplier and just before start of supply they objected and cancelled my transfer .
neutral	so_far they have played this trick 0 times so now been with them an extra 0 months .
neutral	never used them they will never_let you go .
neutral	update_: on reflection i now confirm that i have transferred my supply to a new company with the assistance of their complaints team .
neutral	although i am unhappy with the process i had to endure their complaints team are 0_star .
neutral	i am extremely happy with the regular calls i received from the complaints team to ensure the transfer of supply would proceed without_any other problems .
neutral	i am also happy that they refunded me the difference_between the cost of energy with scottish_power and my new supplier on my final_bill so i was not out of pocket .
neutral	i purchased several items tru amazon but when i tried to use the 00_%_discount_voucher it could not be used
neutral	they want you to dump going tru amazon and deal direct but this means you have no protection
neutral	don_'_t like their style , be careful
neutral	peter
neutral	we bought two items from pro_cook , one was a set of knives and a knife rack which was fine , a good price and a decent set of knives .
neutral	the second item was a marble rolling pin , unfortunately this item was not satisfactory as when using it it fell to the floor and smashed , something which we had not been_warned anywhere could happen .
neutral	there service and website were otherwise fine and delivery was prompt .
neutral	after our weeks holiday we responded to the company '_s feedback request stating that the rented_property did not comply with the company '_s internet still posted advert and advised this could be seen as an issue under trading_standards legislation .
neutral	we simply asked that this matter be looked into in order that others were not disappointed .
neutral	a month later the blue_chip are to date yet to respond , perhaps what you should expect after they have your money banked .
neutral	i like using juno because they stock so much and their postal service is always swift and packaging good .
neutral	however , the search_engine drives me a bit crazy .
neutral	i can never seem to find what i want but if i dig deep enough i normally find it , it really needs some work .
neutral	great price
neutral	but this time was let_down by the delivery
neutral	did not turn_up on the day it should
neutral	turned_up next_day at 0 :_00pm and that was after i got a distressed phone_call from the albanian delivery driver , and had to go and find him and direct him to my address .
neutral	not impressed with the delivery
neutral	the flowers were beautiful - possibly the best i have bought my wife - however they arrived in a soggy box as the water had somehow leaked in transit ... so much so that the accompanying card was barely readable .
neutral	the canna lilies are still going_strong after 00 days but we had to dispose of the roses after a week as they were dead , and in some cases , rotten .
neutral	thankfully the canna lilies were the important flowers for the occasion .
neutral	used company many_times with no_problems .
neutral	delivery arrived on time .
neutral	when we fitted the cylinder and commissioned we found no water .
neutral	after a few hours looking for an air lock we found some foam insulation had got into the tank and blocked the outlet .
neutral	not very happy .
neutral	got foam out .
neutral	filled with water again then noticed a very small leak on the element flange . took element out a few_times then found foam sprayed over part of the flange face producing a leak .
neutral	shame as this company is normally really good .
neutral	perhaps it was just one of those off days .
neutral	i will_deff use them again as i belive this was a one off .
neutral	two points were disappointing .
neutral	0 .
neutral	the packaging is not robust enough to avoid the corners of the book being damaged and dog - eared .
neutral	it is not a major_issue , but these books are not cheap and should be packed with sufficiently robust_packaging to survive delivery undamaged .
neutral	0 .
neutral	advice of delivery e_- mails were misleading .
neutral	we received an e_- mail saying that the book had been despatched more than a week before arriving .
neutral	apparently you send out " despatched " notices when the book has_been despatched from your german factory to your uk distribution_centre .
neutral	well , ordering the tyres is simple enough but i will not know what they are like or what the service is like until they are fitted .
neutral	that is not until monday 0st july
neutral	i thought your products and prices are great but you could not forfill my order and my part order took to long to deliver but i will give you the benefit of the doubt and try you again
neutral	the frames were reasonably - priced , unusual and stylish .
neutral	there was some_confusion and back - and - forth with emails , though , and the first pair i was sent were misaligned .
neutral	but when my glasses eventually arrived , i was very satisfied .
neutral	i wanted to do a course , that was advertised in an email from park_cameras .
neutral	i clicked on it to find more info , and was directed to a page ; this , at the bottom , mentioned another course , taking place on a different day , which i could book at a special price if i booked both together , which i did .
neutral	confirmation came back , saying that both courses would be on the same day , which was no good to me .
neutral	it took me a while to convince them that their web_site was wrong .
neutral	eventually i got a refund on the second course , but it means that if i want to do it at some future date i will have to pay the increased amount , through no fault of my own .
neutral	basically park need to check all references to something on their site .
neutral	it will not be the first time !
neutral	!
neutral	i booked through the gosimply website as it gave a good comparison of options and produced the lowest_price from a reputable provider .
neutral	the booking was painless but the payment element was a little odd .
neutral	all was well until the ' complete payment ' button was pressed , then the system just kept cycling through as though it had not been processed .
neutral	i was just about to cancel and start again when i thought i ' d better check my e_- mails to see if i had received confirmation of payment and there it was - yet the payment was still happily cycling away on screen as if unprocessed .
neutral	i cancelled that and moved on !
neutral	t shirt arrived in reasonable time but disappointed by the quality given the high price .
neutral	if you want to no what color pants steven fry has put on today , this one is for you , i myself dont want everyone out there being told what i am doing , good if your that lonely bored or cant talk to someone in the real world ....
neutral	apple_iphone mobile ( facebook ) keeps_crashing , when your paying all that money you want more than just a die hard sequel that like the films gets higher & higher , but the bottom_line is they all do the same thing , break easy , battery_life cant cope with lots going on , so is it really a mobile when your always plugged in the mains or waiting for it to be repaired ( have a spare back up phone to be safe )
neutral	it should of been called nosebook , invite the outside world into your underwear draw , but if you want to flag your birthday or make your x pay attention then this one is for you ( beware you may end up on jerry springer ).
neutral	some games are worth leaving your lover for as well
neutral	yes its cheap , yes there are many bargains , and yes 00_% of it all is snide .
neutral	i found this a very demanding site , that with one wrong move your in court being billed
neutral	have been satisfied with the products , prices and delivery times in the past so i '_m willing to put up with difficulties ordering online and the total_lack of a telephone order service .
neutral	i can not fault merlin_cycles on price , which is just as well because if anything_goes_wrong and you have to deal with their employees then you are met with complete indifference to your plight .
neutral	this is the 0nd time i have bought a bike from them in as many months .
neutral	twice they have advertised that the bike will take no_longer_than 00 days to be stocked and a further few_days to be built .
neutral	each time it has taken a month for my bike to arrive .
neutral	if they can '_t guarantee the times that they choose to advertise why do they bother ?
neutral	complain_about this and you will receive no apology .
neutral	you can almost imagine them shrugging their shoulders .
neutral	clueless .
neutral	customer service very poor .
neutral	good price and fast delivery
neutral	only issue here is the communication when the item was out of stock and my account was debited !?!?!?
neutral	!
neutral	i think the pre payment system with vehicle recognition should be clearer .
neutral	i perhaps wrongly , assumed the number_plate recognition allowed_me to go straight to the barrier when leaving the car_park and insert my ticket with my reg_number on it .
neutral	i did not expect an aggressive response from who ever is at the other side of the answer system to speak to me as if i was stupid .
neutral	0 things .
neutral	0 . sort_out the number_plate recognition , or at lease make it clearer to understand .
neutral	do i have to go to the desk with my ticket or not ?
neutral	( maybe i am stupid )
neutral	0 . try not to employ morons who are allowed to be customer facing .
neutral	i would hate to think a tourist was welcomed to our country by the person_who answered me .
neutral	i took a chance and ordered an outwell folding table on the basis that as it cost about £_00 and was from a well_known_brand it would be well_designed and functional .
neutral	the website had limited information about the product .
neutral	on receipt i discovered that the 0 legs are too long to fold into the body of the table so all have to be unscrewed as well as folded and secured with fiddly velcro_straps .
neutral	the description says the table ' opens and folds in seconds ' - not if you include the time to screw in / out all 0 legs .
neutral	the ' adjustable feet ' have a range of about 0cm ( not mentioned in the description ), perhaps useful for stopping a wobble on an uneven wooden_floor but useless for leveling a table on a sloping campsite , which is what i wanted .
neutral	the table needs telescopic locking legs with at_least 00cm range .
neutral	it cost me £_00 and some inconvenience to return the table , all avoidable if the website description had been more comprehensive with more pictures , particularly of the underside and leg arrangement .
neutral	on a positive_note the delivery was quick .
neutral	the returns process could be easier .
neutral	my only complaint is that i paid extra for the cards to be delivered the next_day .
neutral	they did not arrive until 0 . 00pm on the day after that which is not really acceptable
neutral	website great , products and prices are great , delivery tracking and delivery excellent .
neutral	they lose a couple of stars for issuing a generic " there is an issue with your order , please call ..." message if you specify an_alternate delivery address even if you have been through the " verified by visa " process which thieves won_'_t be able to get through .
neutral	i can '_t hang_around in telephone queues during the business day ( and they always have a queue ) but got through in the last 00_mins of their working day on a friday .
neutral	this is just an unneccessary irritation to genuine customers ... real scammers will try to change the delivery address retrospectively by telephone .
neutral	i have recently obtained 0 priscrition items , one for my self , the other for my wife .
neutral	these were identical and need a private_prescription .
neutral	they were small packages .
neutral	we used the online doctor service to obtain the prescriptions which was very quick , efficient and useful .
neutral	my only complaint was that i had to pay 0 postage chages .
neutral	after my berlin trip in feb i expected to get my nectar_points within 00 days .
neutral	no luck .
neutral	i wauited 00 days before e amiling a complaint .
neutral	i received a generic_reply explaining that nectar_points are given out 00 days after a trip was completed .
neutral	i replyed explaining my problem .
neutral	no reply .
neutral	tried again 0 days_later .
neutral	no reply .
neutral	tried again explaining that i did not think this was a good or respectful way to treat a customer and said i presumed that they no_longer wanted my business .
neutral	no reply .
neutral	nice well located studio but very compact and expensive for what it was .
neutral	purchased simms star cleats , the website says the box contains 00 when in fact it only contains 00 , otherwise i would have given 00 stars given the chance .
neutral	haven_'_t opened the container to check but unless they have opened it and placed an extra 0 in , it says 00 .
neutral	it '_s all in the detail !
neutral	i am sure my equipment will turn_up promptly and as ordered .
neutral	my gripe is in the fact that despite emailing them and telephoning them , leaving my details for a callback to enquire_about an armed_forces discount that one of the shops confirmed they do offer , nobody bothered to reply to either .
neutral	i ended_up ordering regardless but will go back to my previous_supplier for future orders .
neutral	not feeling very valued .
neutral	lots of leafiness and delivered in a sealed_box .
neutral	best not to have them sent directly to someone , but have them sent to you first and prepare them before giving them as a gift .
neutral	the delivery was fast but the bouquet was not like the one on the website which is really beautiful .
neutral	i would not repeat it .
neutral	like the product but opened up a long time after purchase as was a gift and had several marks quite disappointed
neutral	i placed an order the order never arrived on the date given so i rang bulkpowders was told it should be with me the next_day , it still never arrived .
neutral	after another phone_call i was told the delivery company damaged my parcel so it has to be returned to bulkpowders and a refund will be give .
neutral	customer service was fast and very polite but still never got the protein i ordered after 0 days and still_waiting for a refund now .
neutral	the whole_experience was ok as customer service was lovely but frustration with not getting my order at all .
neutral	im very pleased with the pine bedside_tables although a carpenter with over 00 years experience reckins their a cheap oak not pine im happy with them as they are steardy and well made you need to be a bit honest with people though this is not pine
neutral	this is not a bad review i really do enjoy using ebay , however it used to be so much_better .
neutral	if the prices to buy & sell keep rising as they have been doing , i wonder where ebay will be in five years from now ?
neutral	to be honest i don_'_t think the royal_mail price increase for small items has helped the matter .
neutral	for sure there has_been a steady decline in the ebay experience compared to five years previous .
neutral	i hope it improves , brilliant site for finding spares or used items you may need that are no_longer sold by retailers
neutral	in responding to to an e_- mail special_offer the benefit is somewhat nullified by the post and packing charge - not much of an offer is my conclusion .
neutral	was told on each_occasion that it would be about 00_mins to wait , took between 00 & 00 , ok if its nice weather , will use them again though as they are reasonably_priced
neutral	my valintine roses not delivered to my sweetheart till 00 : 00 , she was not amused .
neutral	it should of been a special day for her but due to the very late delivery the very nice roses & teddy pagage did not have the special affect it was meant to !!!
neutral	!
neutral	all in all the roses were nice but the delivery time not good !!!
neutral	!
neutral	the inability of the basket to auto update quantities is a big negative .
neutral	e g tracking even when selected is not added unless you manually update .
neutral	there is not much to say other than their web_site and prices are good but the delivery takes too long and sometimes even longer_than stated on their website .
neutral	so , if you are buying essential medicinal food , you need to factor this poor delivery time into your calculations .
neutral	i will still use them though , so i guess that is all that matters .
neutral	the good :
neutral	it '_s great how they can offer to beat everybody_else '_s price by an extra 0 %, that '_s their only forte .
neutral	the bad :
neutral	if you make big order they always take a long time to process it , sometime they don_'_t have the stuff in stock and they have to order it and that takes 0 - 0 business days for them to get the order and another 0 - 0 business days for you to get your order ...
neutral	it '_s ridiculous , sometimes you have to wait 0 - 0_weeks for an order .
neutral	and they will ignore any claims you make if any of the items of the shipment was damaged , so if it something broke in your shipment , good luck hearing back from them ...
neutral	i know i didn_'_t .
neutral	prices and range are good but delivery is slow , 0 days and no goods yet .
neutral	i did all the chasing with no feedback .
neutral	may not use them again
neutral	due to some poor customer service i was an extra £_000 out of pocket .
neutral	this was due to the return flight i booked no_longer being available after i paid for it .
neutral	i spent 0 calls and over 0 hours trying to tell tr staff that the flight was sold out a i wanted to change but the tr staff kept saying it was their system .
neutral	due to the change of flight and having to extend my room for a late flight i was out of pocket .
neutral	otherwise things went well .
neutral	i have no idea of the service as not got my goods yet ?
neutral	good service but i ordered an adroid ace and it said on the o0 website i could get bbc_iplayer which was actually incorrect .
neutral	despite confirmation of the order stating the period when my goods would be delivered the failled to arrive until three_days_later .
neutral	when they were delived instead of following the requested instructions of where the parcel could be left they were returned to the mail sorting_office so had to be collected from there .
neutral	not ideal .
neutral	on the plus_side the goods were as expected and all in good working order .
neutral	sds sell beautifully manufactured products at very reasonable prices , unfortunately the parcels are delivered by dpd who are utterly , utterly_useless .
neutral	when spending over £_000 on a new winter_jacket you don_'_t expect the item to be faulty .
neutral	when this was discovered i was devastated .
neutral	however i must_say that the customer service team did a spot on job in issuing a replacement jacket as soon as i could prove the faulty item was on its way back to them ( via the collect_+ tracking_number )
neutral	bought a £ 0 , 000 . 00 pc its worth every_penny and im very happy with it , and the time it took to get here was very quick just a shame that i turned it on and it keeps_crashing due to the graphics_card being faulty and have to send it .
neutral	just you pay all the money for a pc , and you just want it to work straight off but thats life .
neutral	i found the case , wasnt put_together 000_% properly .
neutral	just shame about the customer service , wasnt very helpful when telling_me what the problem was and wanting to do everything by email instead of the phone .
neutral	my pc dont work how can i send emails ... phone would be 00x better :/
neutral	the process up to the final_settlement is good and you are kept well informed .
neutral	the final_settlement and receipt of cheque is a little long_winded .
neutral	i ordered a footmuff which only got delivered 00 days after i placed my order .
neutral	last time i ordered something from plo i got it within 0 days so i was very impressed .
neutral	this time though i was disappointed , and it didn_'_t help that all their website said was that my item had been dispatched and i couldn_'_t track it any further .
neutral	after 00 days i wrote to them and they sent me a prompt reply saying that they would send out a replacement asap .
neutral	this impressed my as i had anticipated having to " prove " i hadn_'_t received my parcel some how .
neutral	coincidentally my original item actually turned_up the same day so i cancelled the replacement .
neutral	i was disappointed with the length of time it took to receive the footmuff but i was impressed with how plo dealt_with my email and issue .
neutral	might be an idea to stock up on the best sellers , i '_ve tried for replacement wicks batteries and melon magic all out of stock .
neutral	driver was there when we got there , but had trouble trying to drive my automatic car .
neutral	told us when we were collecting our baggage that they would be 00_mins and turned_up 00_mins after we got outside , all seemed ok until we drove_away then noticed the mud on the floor drivers_side and arm rests and door panels inside .
neutral	i am just hoping as well that we didnt get a parking ticket when the car was picked_up as we saw the traffic warden was telling him to move away but he was chatting to someone then had trouble driving the car off .
neutral	service was good , prices were rubbish .
neutral	we followed the directions we received on the confirmation_email , we were told to go to a certain bay on the car_park were we would be picked_up by a meet and greet service .
neutral	however this never happened , every other car_hire company picked all other passengers oup but we were left_stranded we phoned the number on the email and was just directed to a spanish voicemail .
neutral	we then asked another company were bravo car_hire was and were told it was across a busy main_road next to the ponderosa restaurants .
neutral	i then had to walk across the busy_road / main_entrance to the airport to the car_hire company with my daughter and wife pulling all our_luggage behind us to get to the car_hire company .
neutral	luckily once the the service was quick and efficient and a nice clean car waiting for us .
neutral	great selection of discounts and special money off deals , great percentage money back deals , but processing times take to long ... if your happy to wait for your money then great you will be rewarded , if not ... maybe this isnt the place for you .
neutral	i was disapointed to receive only part of my order , with no explanation that only part of the order was being delivered or when the remainder would be expected i understand that payment has_been taken for the whole order .
neutral	it is not the level of cost but the lack of information that i find irritating
neutral	when i booked on line i did not note any reference to the fact that your office was not at the air port , and was a long trip from the airport on a very over crowered bus
neutral	display_case is really well made .
neutral	excellent base , plastic shaped very well indeed .
neutral	just a shame that there is 0 long scratch right across the front .
neutral	looks_like the packer accidentally dragged a ring over it .
neutral	could not polish it out and case was too big for the hassle of returning , so just turned it around so barely_noticeable .
neutral	generally still happy though .
neutral	i received and email_saying my strings had been dispatched , then another email was sent saying that my strings weren_'_t in stock and there would be a delay .
neutral	i was told the strings would arrive to the shop on a tuesday and then they would be sent to me .
neutral	they were not dispatched to me until the friday .
neutral	will probably search for an_alternative place to get my strings .
neutral	unfortunately when i received my package it did not contain the items that i had ordered , the delivery address on the front of the package was correct but the delivery note inside related to another person_who lived on the other side of the country .
neutral	fortunately for me , ( and ellis_brigham ) the person that received my item was kind enough to contacted me , informing_me that he had received my order .
neutral	both of us ended_up taking our items to our local_stores .
neutral	hopefully ellis_brigham mail order dept have rectified the problem , making the necessary apology for the inconvenience , however they did fail failed to make any recompense for the inconvenience as both myself and the other party ended_up returning our goods to our local_stores , the other option being that we waited in for the goods to be collected .
neutral	i have ordered several pairs of glassess most have had to be returned .
neutral	you enquire regarding our recent order .
neutral	by enlarge we were happy with the quality of the meat , mainly steak .
neutral	as a family of three , however , we were less enthralled to receive 0kg of chicken in one pack .!
neutral	on receipt we stick these straight into the freezer only to find that when we need to use it , we have to defreeze the entire lot .
neutral	we are not a restaurant and have a problem as to how to eat all this chicken within . say 00_hours !
neutral	i ordered on a friday and paid £_00 for a saturday delivery but didn_'_t get the product until monday_afternoon
neutral	great place , in good spot with nice night club , everyone seen friendly , cheap would be wonderful if the materass were bit more comfortable anyway i will suggest to anyone
neutral	i think aria is a great company with some fantastic bargains .
neutral	for me the only thing that lets them down is there delivery charges .
neutral	i was going to order an asus motherboard and 0 gb of ddr0_memory from them the other day .
neutral	now the strange thing was that the motherboard had free delivery so i thought that by adding the memory to it would also count as free delivery , but i was shocked as the delivery went up to over £_00 , if i had ordered them separately i would have got free delivery on the motherboard and paid just over £ 0 delivery on the memory . there great prices which are some of the cheapest around are really let_down by there delivery charges , so for me only 0_stars , get your delivery charges sorted_out and it would have been 0_stars .
neutral	pitty really .
neutral	ordered and bought 00 red_roses quality not very good not usual colour of red one would expect
neutral	i have bought several items through top cash_back .
neutral	some are still outstanding and have been for many months .
neutral	i can '_t see them being paid at all and there is no one at top cash_back to call to investigate for me .
neutral	i think it '_s a poor site which offers a lot and sometimes fails to deliver !
neutral	ordered ipad charging stand and received email update the following_day saying that it had been dispatched .
neutral	unfortunately it had not arrived 00 working_days_later , despite standard delivery being described as " within 0 working_days ".
neutral	my initial attempts to contact nicecans . co . uk via the form on their website and via_email did not receive any response .
neutral	however , four days_later i did get an email from their complaints_department , apologising for the delay and saying that a replacement had been dispatched by 0st_class mail , which duly_arrived a couple of days_later .
neutral	the box was rather distressed having been sent in just a plastic_envelope without_any padding , but the product is fine .
neutral	i received only one response to my request and that was more_expensive than buying the part new .
neutral	however , full_marks to the one respondent .
neutral	i was very happy with how quickly the flowers were delivered but i wash it didn_'_t cost to much .
neutral	flowers were well_protected / packaged and delivery was on schedule .
neutral	i upgraded to a deluxe_bouquet and have to say although the flowers were lovely , the presentation was lacking .
neutral	for my upgrade i didnt have a larger_bouquet i simply had 0 more flowers separate to the main bunch .
neutral	also not much of anything_else to bulk out and compliment the flowers i chose .
neutral	package came quickly enough but the box was too small , the mask was crammed in and scratched a little , item was returned due to a change of plan , but still was unhappy with the delivery condition
neutral	as usual , the flowers were delivered on time , exactly as_described , and very well_packed .
neutral	unfortunately although every item was fresh , the main flowers , roses were actually dead on arrival !!
neutral	we have always been delighted with serenatas service and will not let this colour our judgement , and although my wife was disappointed we hope that this was just a ' one - off !'
neutral	clive vernon
neutral	maximuscle are usually very good , couriers this time were unreliable and took a week to deliver .
neutral	when ordering before i have had my products arrive within two_days ,
neutral	not sure yet if i start getting calls from canvassing companys because my information has_been sold on ile stop useing the internet
neutral	guitar was listed as next_day delivery ( this was contested , but it was ) - didn_'_t receive item for 0 days (???)
neutral	- too late for a birthday_present .
neutral	received £_00 compensation .
neutral	i suggest you change courier ....
neutral	found what i was looking for , a special concealed barrel hinge , decided to buy a spare but the p_&_p was more than the hinges , no option for standard royal_mail postage .
neutral	item came by currier next_day and was excellant delivery but i was in no hurry and would have prefered to wait a week for half the cost .
neutral	expensive .
neutral	i can '_t believe_how quickly the order was delivered , but ................. the wrong order was sent out !
neutral	even_though this had been checked twice .
neutral	rectification was as quick as the original order so no big deal but there is always the issue of returns which are always a pain !
neutral	on time delivery .
neutral	prices beat local competition .
neutral	good quality worktop .
neutral	i purchased this small item and found the cost of the item was reasonable but the postage was far to high for such a small item making the overall cost far to expencive , it also thought it took a bit to long to arrive for the cost charged .
neutral	the service was good overall , but to wait for over a week for the goods to come does take some getting used to !
neutral	service and delivery were very good but regretfully ink_cartridge supplied for dell 000 printer was rejected by printer and did not work , therefore making it expensive .
neutral	good on overall weekly_shop it stock most brands friendly staff
neutral	although the prices were very reasonably the delivery service in my opinion is very poor , no email when order was completed or text .
neutral	i must_say that i choose the free delivery option ( 0 to 0 days ), but my order was made over a week_ago and have still not arrived after two_weeks ........ not had a text to say when my delivery will be made either .
neutral	hence only three stars .
neutral	site a little_slow to use and lacking maps to assist with hotel locations , but fairly competitive in terms of pricing .
neutral	however , alpharooms fail to be up front when it comes to charges for using a debit / credit_card .
neutral	in their terms and conditions , reference is made to bookings being subject to such a charge where_applicable , but it is only at the final payment stage when this becomes visible .
neutral	for my own hotel booking , an option to avoid debit / credit_card costs was offered by paying with a fairfx prepaid mastercard .
neutral	despite having sufficient funds in my fairfx account , my payment was twice refused , forcing_me to pay extra for booking with a debit_card .
neutral	i was left with the opinion that the " free " fairfx offer was a bit of a con , and would suggest that alpharooms be more transparent on their card charges .
neutral	well , i went on line and followed the couriers instructions as to where they could leave my parcel .
neutral	i asked them to leave it under my barbecue for delivery on monday , they turned_up didn_'_t leave the parcel and texted me to say no one was home to sign for it .
neutral	i rang the local office and told them what i had done and even gave them the drivers_name " paul ", they said they had no record of this on the system even_though i quoted the drivers_name they didn_'_t believe me .
neutral	well i said , the system your using doesn_'_t work , the lady replied that '_s head offices central log not ours .
neutral	case closed , and thanks to nottingham_drum and guitar .
neutral	do vistit buzz catering site where u will get cheap catering accessories ..
neutral	good prices and easy to arrange appointments
neutral	last saturday i ordered a spring bouquet for my wife to celebrate_our_anniversary .
neutral	the website showed a lovely collection , primarily reds and yellows , that was bright and cheerful .
neutral	unfortunately i wasn_'_t there when it arrived , so my wife accepted it and arranged it in the vase .
neutral	when i saw it i was deeply disappointed ( so was she ), as it was largely dark colours , andd not at all cheerful .
neutral	in the past i '_ve got exactly_what i '_ve seen on the website , so this really shook me .
neutral	i emailed the site to express my disappointment and to give them a chance to explain , but so_far i '_ve heard_nothing from them .
neutral	been using them for years , loved the price match_guarantee , but on my last purchase they didn_'_t accept the price match and decided to charge me more .
neutral	be wary , i '_ll probably cancel my order and order it from the other source who is cheaper .
neutral	i ordered a £_00 bunch of flowers for my wife and had them delivered to her work .
neutral	the ordering_process was fine - except it didn_'_t like me changing the address to direct the delivery to my wife '_s specific office .
neutral	the flowers arrived on time and my wife was suitably_impressed by the box , however the flowers inside needed a box half the size and were less_than impressive compared to the picture ( mainly that none were in bloom so a lot of green and stalk and very little flower ).
neutral	they may go on to bloom and be lovely but currently i feel i ' d have been better picking a bouquet from a local_supermarket which would have provided more flowers , better presentation and probably have been cheaper .
neutral	as well as the above the quantity of drink powder was miserly particularly at a cost of £ 0 . 00p a time
neutral	macaroon bars were excellent
neutral	been using this website for a while now , they have a good variety of stock , however alot of it i find is very expensive compared to other_sites , advised to shop around a bit before buying from wdc .
neutral	i have used the product before , but am just frustrated at delivery .
neutral	when hdnl tried to deliver and i wasn_'_t home , they took it away and left a calling_card .
neutral	i have tried to get a re - delivery but know that they will probably deliver during the day again ( when i am at work !!)
neutral	there is no system in place , whereby i can leave extra details with hdnl about leaving it with a neighbour or in a safe_place !
neutral	!
neutral	the selection of bikes and accessories are second to none .
neutral	the staff are always so helpful and well informed .
neutral	i spent_nearly_£ 0 , 000 on a new s works frame , handlebars etc and paid for sigma_sport to build the bike using the groupset and wheels from my old bike .
neutral	the service was great until i got the bike home .
neutral	the matt_black paintwork was covered in grease marks , presumeably from the build .
neutral	the first time i took the bike out for a ride , i nearly fell_off on the first hill due to the gears jumping all over the place .
neutral	when i took the bike back , the service department rectified the problem straight_away , but the service was more hostile than friendly .
neutral	they even removed a link from the chain , surely this was something that should have been caried out in the first place .
neutral	a week_later i was back in the shop as the saddle was beginning to split .
neutral	sigma agreed to change it without_any issue .
neutral	however , i raised again the issue of the marks on the paintwork .
neutral	at no stage did they apologies or offer to clean it themselves ( the marks are difficult to remove on such a delicate finish ).
neutral	i thought this was extremely poor , especially in view of the amount i had spent .
neutral	i think sigma is still a great shop , but my aftersales experience has certainly given me a tainted view .
neutral	my order number is 000000000 .
neutral	the nitrotek site can be a bit_fiddly to navigate , particularly from different sections of the same product , i . e .
neutral	switching from ' spare_parts ' to ' upgrades ' for a specific_model of rc buggy .
neutral	however , compared to other_sites , it '_s sophisticated enough .
neutral	the layout of products when viewing them is very good and neat .
neutral	unfortunately , 0 items i wanted were not in stock .
neutral	also , the support_ticket system did not let_me submit a ticket nor register , as the captcha image was not displaying .
neutral	i would have hoped that nitrotek would have everything in stock , as there '_s not many other_sites that sell spare acme - tech rc parts , and are well - known .
neutral	due to items not being in stock , i '_ll have to place another order in future and pay for postage again , which is not favourable , but what can i do ?
neutral	the payment system itself is quite smooth , especially when using paypal .
neutral	e_- mail confirmation is quick and a tracking_number provided , which is useful .
neutral	i personally have no concerns over the security of the website , as i bought my rc buggy from them in the first place , but the lack of stock in spare_parts is regrettable , and the glitchy support_ticket system is disappointing .
neutral	spare_parts stock : 0 . 0 / 0
neutral	help & support : 0 / 0
neutral	navigation : 0 . 0 / 0
neutral	ordering : 0 / 0
neutral	i was disappointed when my order for perspex sheeting arrived with every sheet broken .
neutral	it is clear it was broken in transit , but the packaging was so poor , i am not surprised they were all broken .
neutral	they were quick to replace though at a price that was competitive , so worked out ok in the end .
neutral	didn_'_t receive the item straight_away ... when i queried it a week or so later , i was informed that they didn_'_t have any new items to ship to me , as marital were replacing the model imminently .
neutral	i '_m_sure if i hadn_'_t phoned , they still wouldn_'_t have chased the order up .
neutral	when i think back , the same has happened before with laswson his .
neutral	although i have had no_problems with orange in the past , i am now with vodafone who have provided a far_superior service .
neutral	my orange phone could access any website without issue and service was good .
neutral	one of my friends is with orange and he has countless problems ranging_from being blocked from ' adult ' websites including facebook and myspace .
neutral	his phone also experiences regular loss of signal .
neutral	the only good thing is that it `_s cheap .
neutral	the seats on the plains sometimes smell .
neutral	still better_than ryanair though .
neutral	dan
neutral	bra_priser_og rask levering .
neutral	jeg handlet der helt til jeg fikk en erfaring .
neutral	jeg hadde bestilt et objektiv til mitt kamera , men_jeg hadde bestilt feil og ville bytte til rett modell .
neutral	i utgangspunktet problemfritt .
neutral	problemet var at det tok 0 uker fra jeg sendte varen med postens bedriftspakke til de hadde registrert den motatt , til tross for at postens sporing viste at den_var fremme .
neutral	lite hjalp det å skrive til_kundeservice å spørre .
neutral	fikk bare korte innholdsløse svar som ikke hjalp noe .
neutral	the site is fairly easy to use , better_than all these so called ' chep flight ' sites that just send you to easyjet or ryan_air '_s websites .
neutral	jst be careful about the baggage_allowance , insurance , car_hire etc they try to sell you along the way .
neutral	we used to use these to send all our parcels but then got a snotty email_saying that " car parts " wasn_'_t good enough and that if it happened again they would cancel our parcel and refuse to ship for us again .
neutral	( twice ..)
neutral	ok so i got an email from htfr , who i had not used for years , saying they are under new ownership and with a discount_code for returning customers .
neutral	the listings pages are easy to use and there is a clear promise that if it says it '_s in stock it will be .
neutral	i checked a few wants and genres i '_m interested in and found a lot of new - old - stock from the 00s ( probably the remnants of some of the distributors who went_bust a few_years_ago ), so ordered a whole load , avoiding any s / h stuff .
neutral	a few_days before i emailed in a query about one of my target tunes using the contact form on the web_page , but i never_heard back .
neutral	making the transaction however was a bit hi - n - miss .
neutral	i tried to pay by paypal , but the transaction did not register properly , and it returned me to my cart , but with the effect of the discount_code all screwed_up .
neutral	after being 000_% sure that paypal had not been deducted , i tried again with credit_card .
neutral	success !
neutral	a day or so later i had notification of the delivery date , and it arrived as promised .
neutral	i ordered friday_night and the package arrived tuesday - not bad !
neutral	the records were in the cheapest white record mailers , and because i bought so many there were no stiffeners , and 0 mailers were taped_together .
neutral	the cds were in a jiffy_bag , then the mailers and jiffy were in a giant jiffy_bag , folded over and sealed in a plastic mailer bag .
neutral	i wouldn_'_t be too happy if a single record arrived in that style of mailer with no stiffener , but this was decently_packaged and everything was undamaged .
neutral	the vinyl and cds were all new as promised .
neutral	a couple of sleeves had storage / handling wear including bends , but nothing too serious for 00 year_old records .
neutral	like i say i ordered no second - hand stuff , got no response to a query and the transaction system leaves a bit to be desired , so a cautious 0_stars in_spite of excellent product and quick , well - packed delivery .
neutral	good price but time that the booking_fee was incorporated in the price .
neutral	and why on earth does your name have to be four letters , mine is three !
neutral	just lost you another star !
neutral	but not so great on shipping time .
neutral	six days after my order , stuff is still not shipped from the warehouse .
neutral	i have a fedex number finally ... but it '_s still not registering .
neutral	i suppose stuff happens and i '_ll give them another shot when i need a refill of my purchase , however two strikes and i '_ll move on .
neutral	cheaper_than i thot .. easy to sort_out .
neutral	u can manage it on line ..
neutral	while i have no strong opinion about tool - stop i was very unhappy with the courier service they use .
neutral	the courier company said they came while i was at home but i waited in all day and missed them . they did not leave a note though they said they did .
neutral	i had to travel to their depot in park royal to collect the saw as they told me it would only be re - delivered 0 days_later .
neutral	if i was tool - stop i would use a courier that notified my clients by text as to expected delivery date and time .
neutral	the tracking website details are not that useful .
neutral	the only other disappointment for me was there was no case or bag supplied with the saw .
neutral	for the price paid i think this was poor .
neutral	took nearly a week to come and the postage was 0 quid royal_mail quicker and cheaper but always a good products tho
neutral	ordered on fri 00th_november , delivered monday 00th
neutral	i call this super service , but phone contact not great .
neutral	perhaps they need not bother .
neutral	i was not that happy with the flowers at all .
neutral	there was not one lilly at all in the flowers , and these were substituted with the worst flower of all in a carnation .
neutral	also there were hardly_any roses also .
neutral	not the best bunch of flowers i have ever ordered thats for sure .
neutral	international services definitely requires improvement .
neutral	prices need to bejustified
neutral	htc_desire nice phone but why oh why did they allocate such a small internal memory .
neutral	even with sd_card the phone tells you it is full .. which it isn_’_t .
neutral	i '_m generally happy with littlewoods , however there have been occasions when customer_services have been slow to respond to a query , and very occasionally no response at all .
neutral	when they do respond queries are usually resolved fairly quickly , but there have been a few occasions when it has taken a while to resolve an issue .
neutral	deliveries are usually quick , however i don_'_t pay much attention to the delivery estimates , as orders can arrive either much_quicker_than_expected , or take longer_than estimated .
neutral	for this reason i prefer to deliver to either my work address or use collect_+ for smaller items , as otherwise it '_s difficult to know when to book a day off work for delivery .
neutral	most prices seem reasonable , however some items appear to be overpriced in my opinion .
neutral	when combined with the apr for paying over a longer period of time the total_cost can be significant .
neutral	overall not bad service and prices from littlewoods but definitely room for improvement .
neutral	a group of 00 lads on stag wanting to have a good time !
neutral	having shelled out all that money , we would have expected more !
neutral	chilli_sauce did not have to do any of the leg work as we told them what we wanted , thye priced it up and we went with it .
neutral	not a good experience , will not book again and will tell friends and family not to book with cs either , suggest trying red seven ( sufficient good experience )
neutral	please stop sending me junk_mail .
neutral	when i want something i '_ll ask for it .
neutral	good park and ride facility , except neither the bar_code scanner or payment card worked to enter or exit the car_park , meaning i had to press the help button to gain_entry .
neutral	not a very professional sales_team dont seem to know what there talking_about quite often , dont_know exactly when items will shipped and never carry all stock in all options with protein supplements often dont have all flavours .
neutral	average service but not the best .
neutral	stock_levels were not reported accurately .
neutral	placed order only to be told that they were out of stock in my size of 0 items .
neutral	one of which was the sole_reason i placed the order in the first place .
neutral	i like itunes but it has got very expensive .
neutral	part_exchanged my 0 year_old ford_ka which i bought brand_new from this garage , after 000 , 000 trouble_free miles . this time i bought a 0 year_old ka with 0 , 000_miles on the clock .
neutral	because there was a private plate on my vehicle and some dual controls to change over it was 0_weeks before i got the new car . whilst waiting for these weeks to pass and having signed the new agreement i received a letter from ford finance about a missed payment on my old car , i still had 0 payments to go .
neutral	jennings had some how managed to forget to settle my previous car finance despite a new agreement being in place , it was then paid .
neutral	not a good start but hey no_problems with my last car !
neutral	!
neutral	the day came to pick_up the car and as we sorted last bits and pieces and i was shown how many checks the car had gone_through before i was receiving it the salesman held up the spare , none remote key declaring the other was missing , but it wouldnt take long to get another !!!
neutral	despite having 0_weeks to sort this . not looking good .
neutral	got in the car started the engine , sure i heard a knock ??
neutral	drove home with occasional , " i '_m_sure i heard a knock there ".
neutral	turned engine off , definate knock .
neutral	rang and told salesman , " thats strange , surprised i never_heard it when i drove it but pop it back and sure we will sort it ".
neutral	i had a look under engine that night and discovered a bolt was missing from the bottom metal radiator hose where it bolts to the subframe , put a bolt in , knock gone .
neutral	:-)
neutral	got a call on the friday before_christmas to say key was in so duly arranged to go in the next_day .
neutral	the heater fan was buzzing occasionally and it had a slight groan on the steering at low speeds so i was going to mention these item too .
neutral	there for 0 . 00 , explained other problems , car was whisked_away and i had a coffee in the waiting area .
neutral	00_minutes later good news and bad_news .
neutral	good news new key up and running , bad_news spare key has_been blocked , so do not use and we will be in touch in the new year to programme a new one !!!
neutral	they couldnt hear fan rattle or groan but to be fair they were a bit random .
neutral	drove home a bit happier :-)
neutral	as the car is used for driving tuition i '_m in it an awful_lot and fitting in trips to the garage are very rare so i '_ve coped without a spare key , no great hardship , and the other 0 faults have nicely grown louder making detection easier .
neutral	also the drivers seat now doesn_'_t click into position without a great push or it frightens some poor learner to death when it suddenly bangs into place at some in - opportune moment !!
neutral	!
neutral	got a cancellation this morning so drove 00_minutes to the garage to be told they are so busy they cannot come out to see the vehicle and i have to book it in for them to look / listen to these problems and then book it in again to get any_problems solved !!!
neutral	i was told even if i needed a bulb changing they couldnt do it until next week .
neutral	i mentioned my replacement key and was told it was replaced on january 0rd this year !!!
neutral	they will order another key and program it when my car comes in for the above problems .
neutral	not sure how they had confused me coming in and having a key programmed !
neutral	!
neutral	i have put off writing this review thinking that they will sort things out once i pop in and let them listen / look to things , then i book it in and all '_s rosy .
neutral	its not to be .
neutral	the last car only had the first service done by jennings then i did all the other '_s myself , its cheaper and you know whats done but obviously not everyone can do that .
neutral	i '_m always on a tight_schedule with my work and i have never found a garage that understands this , even on that one and only service i didn_'_t get the car back at the alloted_time because they didn_'_t have an oil_filter for it in stock !!!!!
neutral	maybe i should have learnt that so long as you dont have to deal with the service department then alls good but if you do then i think its god help you .
neutral	purchasing the vehicle from the salesman was the usual 00 / 00 but its been all down_hill from there .
neutral	sorry about the lengh of this review , it would have been much shorter for my last car lol but i hope it will help anyone purchasing a vehicle from jennings to know what they could be getting into .
neutral	i recently ordered a brake roller repair kit and a custom designed poster .
neutral	the poster was designed and a proof sent for my approval within hours and the design was perfect first time .
neutral	the only thing that let the order down was that the repair kit and poster were send in the same parcel and due to the weight of the repair kit the poster arrived with several creases in it and doesn_'_t look 000_%.
neutral	for the price i would have expected it to arrive in a cardboard_tube at_least .
neutral	hi ,
neutral	i '_ve just tried the first 0 of the 00 pack of 0oz mature rump_steaks i had delivered last_week by westin_gourmet .
neutral	whilst the steaks looked very lean , and tasted fine , they were both tough in terms of texture .
neutral	i '_m hoping that the other 0 steaks in the pack are more tender to eat .
neutral	not impressed at all .
neutral	sending out said upgrade boards without wiring diagrams
neutral	waste my engineers time and my money standing on the phone or down loading to a computer a wiring_diagram
neutral	not good guys
neutral	on 00th , based on your mail sent on 00th of apr i was supposed to pick_up the car at 00 : 00 from europcar , as per your e_- mail information .
neutral	after spending 00_minutes in the queue at europcar_desk and another 00 min with europcar agent , i was sent to avis , where i got the car in 0 min .
neutral	so , actually i picked_up the car at 00 : 00
neutral	great website .
neutral	easy to order and very competitive price .
neutral	sadly , the portable_hard_drive was poorly_packaged which meant that it arrived with a dent in it .
neutral	we live in a remote community and it '_s some distance to the local post_office .
neutral	so it was going to be more bother than it was worth to send it back .
neutral	does the job - just not in pristine_condition .
neutral	ordered a samsung sound_bar and hdmi_cable for which i was given the same delivery date ; blue_ray arrived but no cable .
neutral	cable arrived next_day in post and another the next_day .
neutral	company prides_itself on own delivery vehicles but is unable to provide more than a 00 hour delivery window .
neutral	most white_van men are now giving 0 hour delivery windows .
neutral	inquired_about the purchase of samsung blue_ray ; was advised that it was out of stock with no know re - stock date and a suggestion that i should purchase a more_expensive unit that i did not want .
neutral	excellent customer service would have retained my details with a promise to let_me know when in stock and reserve me one for immediate delivery .
neutral	company lost that sale .
neutral	a good range of quality products at reasonable prices .
neutral	the only problem i had was some of the led_lamps ordered were incorrectly boxed and therefore not what was ordered .
neutral	i have been promised replacements which i am still_waiting for .
neutral	easy enough , and fast delivery .
neutral	but why can i only buy one months supply at a time when the vet has written out a six month prescription ?
neutral	other than that it was very satisfactory .
neutral	the poor website design hampers the experience of shopping on this site .
neutral	i used to shop from here regularly but the website re - design over the past year or so makes the experience frustrating .
neutral	i ordered home mobile_broadband with the 00day rolling_contract but the process was far from smooth .
neutral	it took multiple phone_calls with different advisors to get my order processed and neither advisor was clear about the pricing of the package .
neutral	i had one salesman continuously try to sell me additional sim_card which would save me some money - but i had to repeat that i did not want this and wanted the mobile_broadband only .
neutral	the actual service has_been good so_far but getting there was a pain to say the least .
neutral	the actual product and delivery were good and on time but i had problems placing my order .
neutral	my first attempt resulted_in an email and a text the following_day saying there was an issue with the order , after being on hold for about 00mins i finally got through only to be told that there was a problem with my payment and i would have to place another order .
neutral	it would have been much more efficient had they just said this in the email to begin with .
neutral	after figuring_out my billing_address was incorrect on my saveonlaptops account i went to change it only to find there was no option to do this on the website .
neutral	the account management tool on the website is very poor and i was forced to create a new account again to place the order .
neutral	i feel that an improvement to the website and the way in which order problems are communicated would be very beneficial for future customers .
neutral	when ordering was told it would be 0st april .. then phoned and told no sooner_than 0th
neutral	therefore it hasn_'_t yet arrived
neutral	although i had a groupon_voucher i still thought i was getting a good deal .
neutral	0 pairs of glasses supposed to be £_00 each for £_00 .. i honestly don_'_t think they ' re any better quality than of the peg glasses from a cheap shop ..
neutral	great customer service but the quality of coffee is not a patch on nespresso .
neutral	like others here , i was tempted by the cheaper prices ( typically around 00p / pod cheaper compared with nespresso ) but sadly the difference in quality was too great and i ended_up returning my order to the fine_coffee_club .
neutral	i ran a taste test making a cup of nespresso ( n ) and fine_coffee_club ( fcc ) coffee and placing the cups next to each other .
neutral	visually , there was a huge_difference , with a very thin , weak - looking foam on the fcc cup compared with the luxuriant , rich appearance of the n cup .
neutral	also i have an issue with the thicker plastic pods from fcc ( n '_s are made from a foil material ).
neutral	my machine ( nespresso u from magimix ) seemed to be really struggling to puncture the fcc pods and the coffee trickled far more slowly into the cup and didn_'_t fill as high as n '_s ( thus requiring an additional input from the user to inject more water through the capsule ).
neutral	i would worry_about the longevity of my machine if i were to use these pods all the time .
neutral	please do some further research on your pods and try to match n '_s more closely .
neutral	use the foil that they use !
neutral	however , i cannot_fault their wonderful customer service and i was fully refunded within 0 days .
neutral	improve the quality of your coffee and your pods and i '_ll be back to you in a flash .
neutral	meantime , i '_m going to stick with nespresso in_spite of the higher prices .
neutral	in the case of the coffee pod industry , it seems that that old cliche rings true in that you really do get what you pay for !
neutral	okay service , not the quickest and marks on the screws and white powder around the lenses that took some getting off .
neutral	i wouldn_'_t say avoid but i wouldn_'_t recommend
neutral	entry to car_park well_signposted and with an automatic registration_number recognition_system upon entry it was very high tech .
neutral	location was excellent having taken_advantage of the online upgrade offer .
neutral	not quite the same experience on leaving with the barrier failing to open despite recognition cameras being present .
neutral	had to search for ticket and unable to reverse back to allow others through as a funnel exit system .
neutral	very frustrating at the end of a long day .
neutral	well_organised , user_friendly and reasonably_priced will be taking a look at other courses on offer staff always available to help .
neutral	the woman employee on arrival failed to confirm return time with us which caused delay on leaving , she also failed to inform us on how we gained fast track in the airport ( which we had purchased ).
neutral	both of these omissions where highlighted to us by another member of staff when questioned on our return .
neutral	and it is for this reason this service does not receive 0_stars and it could so easily have done .
neutral	although i have taken the time to complete this survey i will be very surprised if i get a response .
neutral	ordered off monster due to customer loyalty however took 0 days for order to arrive .
neutral	very disappointed .
neutral	will be buying locally from now on even_though slightly more_expensive .
neutral	i '_m impressed with their service .
neutral	however they do not accept enough barcodes .
neutral	making
neutral	it difficult to complete a minnimum order .
neutral	i am therefore forced to use other_sites who will accept ..
neutral	requested a roof_box key and provided all the information but it wasn_'_t a correct fit and they couldn_'_t supply it .
neutral	saying that the service was super quick , communication good and when they realised they couldn_'_t do it a full_refund was offered without hassle .
neutral	shame really i think they are a good company just couldn_'_t help me ...
neutral	my cards arrived with my photograph of bomber command , quickly and beautifully_printed as always .
neutral	they had been accidentally left in the printer to long however , and the picture was on both_sides .
neutral	i '_ve had to buy some paper to glue onto the inside , so i can write on it .
neutral	i ordered a new pump for my indiset washer_drier , the pump arrived and was exactly as ordered .
neutral	however , i had paid an additional £ 0 for next_day delivery as i needed the part quickly so the misses didn_'_t run out of things to do !
neutral	i received an email the next_morning stating that the part had been dispatched , so i thought great i can get it fixed when i get back from work .
neutral	the part did not arrive for another 0 days !
neutral	in short , don_'_t bother paying for express delivery .
neutral	the item purchased was for my friends stag_do and i '_m really pleased with what i received .
neutral	i '_ve seen plenty of these from other_places but yours was great value for money and made my friend look like an_idiot on his stag_do , like we planned , ha !
neutral	fast service , disappointing website .
neutral	service and voucher worked well but ended_up with additional 00 euro insurance to cover breakdown , tyres , windows and a load of other things the no excess_insurance didn_'_t cover .
neutral	also they give you the car full of petrol and charge you whether you use it or not , which is basically just a way of them making more money .
neutral	we gave it back half full as we were staying near by and i would suspect that most people do the same , so in effect gifted the hire firm 00_euros of fuel .
neutral	all in all i would still do it again but what started out as £_000 for a week ended_up nearer £_000
neutral	beware that first_class delivery can take up to 0 days !
neutral	as the item has_been sent from europe first and the first_class delivery only occurs once it is in the uk !
neutral	feeling rather mislead .
neutral	the flowers were nice , but they were delivered 00_hours_later than requested ( so 00_hours in the van ), so too late for the wedding_anniversary .
neutral	i ' d already requested a redelivery , which was delivered when requested .
neutral	in both_cases , there were quite a few flower_heads broken off .
neutral	they use yodel for delivery .
neutral	those of us who have suffered yodel '_s delivery for amazon know to fear this and with good reason .
neutral	................ when i recently booked for a car_hire pick_up at glasgow_airport i did not expect ( as it was not stated online at time of booking and having not read the information on my reservation confirmation ) to have to find a bus stance and get taken off the airport to collect the car , which of course , meant that the same had to happen for the return of the vehicle , whereas i expected to leave car in the airport car_park not to calculate the additional time required for this extra journey .
neutral	i was initially very pleased with my smart looking new yale front_door and side_panels .
neutral	unfortunately , during a recent cold_spell of weather , we realised that yale '_s promise of draught free doors / panels did not live up to the hype .
neutral	on closer_inspection , the side_panels seemed to have warped and are letting cold northerly winds penetrate deep into our home .
neutral	to make_matters_worse , the door itself also leaks heat , which rather_defeats the reason for fitting a new one in the first place !
neutral	unsure as to whether these problems were caused_by a manufacturing_fault , bad fitting , or an inaccurate pre installation survey , we reported the matter to yale about 0_weeks_ago ( don_'_t be tempted to contact by ' phone - i waited 00_minutes before finally hanging up and trying by email !).
neutral	anyway , to their credit they managed to get someone over to us very quickly .
neutral	regrettably , although acknowledging that there is a fault with the doors / panels , we have heard_nothing whatsoever from yale since .
neutral	so , in summary , a promising looking product , but from my experience , don_'_t expect any urgency from yale if anything_goes_wrong post installation !
neutral	i bought a bed base from here and was found not to fit_properly at the top by the head , have taken pictures , no adjustments can be made
neutral	the phone when it arrived is brilliant , but the dispatch is agonisingly slow , it took 0 days just to pack it for shipping .
neutral	if someone as big as amazon can ship within_00hrs , i think a lesson could be learnt .
neutral	happy with work but image should have been made clearer through my options .
neutral	i was impressed with the rental cost and although i found it somewhat difficult to locate the office i was still happy .
neutral	directions would have helped .
neutral	i would have been happier if my own car could have been kept on the premises but never mind .
neutral	i was pleased with the service from the staff_member until i was viewed as suspicious because my home address did not appear on the data_base .
neutral	is that my fault ?
neutral	i was told i should have brought a utility_bill but i was never told that when i booked .
neutral	i have never had to do this before .
neutral	my driving_licence was sufficient .
neutral	if this is necessary then make it clear .
neutral	i would be happy to rent again because i know the rules .
neutral	but please give more info as to where the pickup_point is and that a utility_bill is required along with a licence .
neutral	a little_slow on delivery but got item in the end and very pleased however knowledge of the product wasn_'_t to good at customer service as i was told when ordering it takes gu00_bulbs and came with product .
neutral	incorrect they are esfitting and do not come supplied minor_detail realy just have 0 wasted bulbs but hey_ho .
neutral	product does look good .
neutral	i recently went to tenerife with a friend and the company gave_me all i needed for a cheap flight and cheap accommodation .
neutral	however , when we arrived in playa las americas the hotel had no idea who we were and was unaware of any booking ...
neutral	bearing in mind we arrived at nearly 00pm so it was nearly the end of our night and we had nowehere to stay .
neutral	luckily the hotel staff were very helpful and we were transferred to a much_nicer , larger hotel for free ...
neutral	result !
neutral	had to wait fo about 00mins . as the delivery company only had one delivery guy .
neutral	the initial collection was pretty good .
neutral	alot_cheaper_than the high_street which makes the wait worth it .
neutral	some of the staff could do with a customer_care course .
neutral	some are helpful and polite and some are not !!
neutral	!
neutral	this is the third time i '_ve placed an order with hispek , they seem to have a problem with customer_services they don_'_t contact you if there is a problem but leave it until you contact them , i don_'_t mind problems with orders as long as i am aware of it .
neutral	having said that my order is supposed to arrive on tuesday 00th_may ( placed on 00th_april ) bank_holiday '_s and stock etc .
neutral	so if i can i '_ll leave a review then .
neutral	to add to my review , i '_ve just received my cooker at the time specified and by the most helpful driver you could want .
neutral	the cooker is all and more than i expected and very pleased with both the price and the product .
neutral	regarding customer service if they just followed up an order after confirmation with an expected delivery date but apart_from that hispek is a good company and worth looking at especially there prices i can '_t fault that .
neutral	delivery did not deliver - disappointed with damaged stuff , poor tracking and late delivery , wasted a day and half to receive the items .
neutral	my home is a mile and half from the depot of tnt ( please check google_map ), delivery did not deliver - disappointed with damaged stuff , poor tracking and late delivery , wasted a day and half to receive the items .
neutral	a lazy delivery man complained of non_existent road closure and thrown back the items back in the depot .
neutral	all boxes were damaged the sun tunnel rigid extension is dented .
neutral	not good experience .
neutral	ordered on monday , processed and dispatched on wednesday arrived thursday with express delivery , but beware you need to sign for it .
neutral	the website says 00_hours to process , however mine took 00_hours , so beware if drugs are running_low .
neutral	prebooked , dropped_off the car on arrival presented with a warning that automatic number_plate recognition not working .
neutral	on return , pre_- booked ticket not recognised as such and presented with a fee twice that already paid .
neutral	not what one wishes when disembarking from a flight and anxious to be on our way .
neutral	the positive_side : a call to the operator quickly re - established the pre_- paid booking and we were away .
neutral	the delivery of the wind_deflectors for my caddy was exceptional .
neutral	the instructions for assembling the product seemed simple but did not prepare me for the problems hat i was to face .
neutral	the adhesion was so critical that i had no opportunity for repositioning , i distorted one visor and broke a piece out of the second whilst trying to correct the location .
neutral	i think that the parts should be aligned before the backing tape is removed and then the application could be trouble_free .
neutral	i '_m disappointed , great service spoilt by poor instructions .
neutral	needs to be a smoother experience
neutral	it would help if you were automatically logged in as a rewards club member , also if it held your credit_card_details so you don_'_t have to input them every time
neutral	can '_t beat the location , however , the attendant can go awol possibly collecting cars and with very little information you can be left standing around waiting for sometime
neutral	product cost was £ 0 and the postage another £ 0 which seems a lot for a small parcel
neutral	i was overall pretty happy with my order although a little annoyed that the price of the item i ordered dropped by £_00 a couple of days_later .
neutral	apart_from this , i loved that there are no_hidden_costs and the delivery was quick !
neutral	uk and us web sites are different with different rates .
neutral	member details ar elost and have to be re entered although the rewards membership number did not get deleted .
neutral	i have no_complaints on the service provided in terms of packaging , delivery and customer service .
neutral	i do think that the packaging whilst not bad has_deteriorated from previous standards , i received crushed creatine pills once or twice , not so good ..
neutral	the products are good or at_least as good as what is affordable to most people .
neutral	major complaint : why is there soya lecithin in my whey_protein !!!
neutral	for a company that prides_itself in pure products why is soya lecithin in my whey ?!
neutral	if i find a alternative to your whey i will take it .
neutral	that '_s my only major_issue .
neutral	compared to everyone_else in the affordable market segment in the uk bp are still amongst the best .
neutral	received extensive kit the other day .
neutral	all looked good if not a bit expensive .
neutral	on using filler which is mixed 00 / 00 with hardener found that both these items seemed to have dried out and had stuck to paper wrapping .
neutral	only option open was to cut down the side of wrapping with a stanley_knife & cut_off ends to find some workable non lumpy product .
neutral	sorted it in the end but looked like filler was old and had dried out .
neutral	otherwise result o . k .
neutral	the delivery time itself was good , however the website should stipulate if something if only one size is not elasticated , etc .
neutral	i purchased a sailor '_s hat for an adult fancy_dress party and it is practically a child '_s sized hat .
neutral	if only the website had advised that this item is one size only then perhaps i would not have purchased it in the first place .
neutral	i understand this is the issue of the manufacturer but maybe this is something you should consider feeding back to them .
neutral	unfortunately they don_'_t live up to the fancy hype , not all the offers are that good .
neutral	i am slightly_disappointed , 0 of my purchases have been particularly troublesome .
neutral	i am now very careful of my choices , they need to vet their offers better , and ensure the suppliers live up to the buyers expectations .
neutral	we need to be able to contact you easier when things go_wrong , your customer service is very poor , our contract is with wowcher , you need to remember that .
neutral	price couldn_'_t be_faulted and neither could communications .
neutral	however , on the day before fitting the garage sent an email confirmation of the appointment but on the day their tyre machine wasn_'_t working ( and hadn_'_t been the previous day ).
neutral	this should have been communicated to me to save a wasted trip .
neutral	the garage did ' phone in the afternoon to say it had been fixed a i rescheduled for the following_day .
neutral	service was prompt , polite and efficient on the day .
neutral	i would use again but maybe not use the same garage for fitting .
neutral	the packaging was coming apart and the inner bag of screws was open with all the screws etc scattered within the box , and instructions were not clear .
neutral	overall prices are higher then competitors .
neutral	however - worth to check for offers .
neutral	especially with discount_coupons .
neutral	great delivery service .
neutral	ordered some branch chain amino_acids and have been waiting 0 days for delivery and still not arrived :-( ..
neutral	rang to ask what the problem
neutral	was and was told out of stock and should hopefully have supplements by the end of the week , i can understand that products sell out , but it doesn_'_t take much to email / contact the buyer to let them know of the delay ...
neutral	i '_ve purchased a few supplements in the past with great service and fast delivery .. hopefully more consideration for the buyer in the future if this should happen again !!
neutral	!
neutral	up until recent years apple we the no . 0 company for fast reliable computers .
neutral	since the release of the ipod and iphone apple have gone down_hill .
neutral	they have broke into a mass market that has made their product fashionable and their quality unreliable .
neutral	it takes to long to get your money , and you dont always get your ' cash_back ' as links do not work .
neutral	to top it all they have stopped letting you ' redeem your money ' to paypal and only offer limited other options , a complete let_down .
neutral	i have generally been happy with o0 service , no major issues , they have replaced faulty handsets without issue , but they are let_down by their email / web support , which is outsourced to india and as usual they do not read your emails properly or do not understand and you end up having to repeat yourself several_times only to be told they cannot help you and you need to call support .
neutral	you really need to call them from the start to avoid this issue as their phone support is email based .
neutral	they are however better in every way than orange or vodafone .
neutral	hello pete , fancy a pint ?
neutral	the instructions on the paper_work about where to drop_off were confusing and when we called for help were told something different completely .
neutral	the handover went_smoothly and the driver was polite and friendly .
neutral	when are car was returned to us after our holiday in the early hours of the morning , so it was dark , it was covered in cement dust ( it had been parked next to a cement works ) and this made it quite difficult to check it over .
neutral	not at all helpful when you have a problem and when trying to pay off the debt they take ages to get back to you .
neutral	they dont keep you informed of how much of your money is actually being paid to your creditors .
neutral	when you have paid it off you have to constantly ask for the final paperwork to be sent to you .
neutral	however they are very quick at setting everything up at the beginning .
neutral	had problems on ordering as the waist sizes for shorts went only to 00 inches for xxxxxxxl -- could get no clarification from web_site on what the real waist sizes were !
neutral	then i ordered around the beginning of chinese new year and they went on an extended time off !
neutral	after the kit was finally completed and shipped it did not take too long to arrive !
neutral	i have tried the kit on and it fits fairly well even_though i do not have a 00_inch waist !
neutral	seems to be a good value -- tell you better after i have completed the aids / lifecycle -- a 000 mile bicycle ride from sf to la to raise money to fight aids !
neutral	if the kit holds up well i will probably consider ordering again -- long before the chinese new year !
neutral	+ customer service seemed to be very good .
neutral	quick response to emails and very polite on the phone .
neutral	- ordered an original optoma part but was offered a replacement because of the long wait from optoma .
neutral	the delux 0d glasse sare very poor indeed , strange flickering and poor colours with messed_up graphics .
neutral	update .
neutral	the company phoned me back and have offered a refund but are looking in to my claims over the glasses .
neutral	i do recommend them for their customer service .
neutral	simple and easy delivery
neutral	i ordered a huub wetsuit and was told it would be in stock in two to three_weeks this actually became 0 - 0 months .
neutral	i had to phone several_times to find out what was happening , i would have expected after my second call someone would have taken it upon themselves to keep me informed .
neutral	great site and prices but the new courier is terrible , i was carded as i wasn_'_t in and no depot to collect it from or phone number to ring apart_from the automated redelivery or website .
neutral	redelivered for another day again wasn_'_t in so went through process again so very bad .
neutral	unlike parcel_force or royal_mail where it was much_easier !
neutral	this is the 0th time we have used cabreramedina when visiting lanzarote .
neutral	we have always gone to them due to the great customer_care , competitive price and large vehicle choice and good vehicle condition .
neutral	unfortunately our car this time was dirty in and out and generally below the usual standard we are used to from this company .
neutral	bought 0 adsl modems of different_types to connect to existing router .
neutral	very helpful response from sales_team to a query about one , albeit quite a long time ( 00_hours ).
neutral	one modem turned_out to be faulty .
neutral	the returns process is reasonably straightforward although it is not compliant with the uk '_s law on direct selling - you will be out of pocket on a return ( which you should not be ) unless you fight for your money .
neutral	secondly they give you only 00 days to return the item ( which could be a problem if you are away ) instead of the legally allowed 0_weeks .
neutral	i placed an order on the 0th_november , on the economy service the delivery was due by the latest 00th_nov , on the 00th i checked the couriers website for an update all it said was order generated so at 0000 i submitted a ticket to my protein asking them to look in to it for me .
neutral	the next_day i had herd nothing so i tried to phone at 0000 after 00mins on hold i hung_up then tried at 0000 spending another 0 mins on hold , at 0000 i spent another 00mins on hold until i gave up and submitted another ticket .
neutral	later that night i received an e_- mail apologising saying the parcel will be sent out and will be with me in another 0 days .
neutral	i feel the customer service is poor , i had to remind them they had forgot to give the parcel to the couriers !!
neutral	then there was no urgency to get the parcel to me , not next_day service still 0 day .
neutral	waiting item not yet with me so no comment as yet
neutral	please make_sure when click for transfer that '_s what we get
neutral	first time using this site so i was wary about giving personal details and booking online .
neutral	paid for the text confirmation but did receive one this made me a little_nervous_about the tickets not being at the venue on the night .
neutral	this is a treat for my grandson and i was worried_about letting him down
neutral	was very happy with the price and product but it did take 0 0 / 0_weeks to arrive which meant i couldnt use the club in a comp i bought it for , but i was told royal_mail had returned the iron twice because it was to big for them to deliver !
neutral	!
neutral	their website just isn_'_t very well_done , its often tedious to find things , and it takes a long time to add things to cart .
neutral	also , their shipping_costs are outrageous .
neutral	however , they have phenomenal deals on products that keep me coming_back for more .
neutral	mazuma make it very easy to get money for your mobile .
neutral	couldn_'_t help but wonder_if £ 0 . 00 was a bit low though
neutral	everything arrived quickly with the entire_process being great .
neutral	my gripe is that one of the records is warped .
neutral	whilst i don_'_t hold juno directly responsible as it could well be the pressing plant or label , it does leave a bitter_taste in my mouth and i will think_twice before ordering again .
neutral	i ordered a0_calendar , but the quality seems too low to me .
neutral	especially for £_00 .
neutral	always helpful and good selection but no call back after price match enquiry which forced me to contact them again .
neutral	the price match was honoured but points cannot be collected on price matched products , unlike_other_companies .
neutral	i was just disappointed when i ordered refils that the i did not realise i had ordered a thin knib roller_ball pen as it was not clear from the web_site
neutral	i have used better web sites inthe past to make orders for other items altough this one is not too bad
neutral	jp - london
neutral	i am reluctant to purchase more goods from your catalogue online in case i have to return the item at considerable cost to me .
neutral	most companies have a postage paid facility for returning goods .
neutral	i like the items on offer but i don_'_t think i '_ll be purchasing any more because of the reason stated above .
neutral	i originally wanted to order over the phone as i had done my internet research and the prices were definitely the best .
neutral	when i called the phone number i could not get through to anyone as i had problems with the selection procedure .
neutral	i felt_like i should just go_ahead and order online , although i did need the equipment in a hurry .
neutral	when i received confirmation from the email ( which all correspondence was very good ) it did show that the delivery address was wrong which consequently meant i did not get the instruments in time as required .
neutral	their courier managed to ' lose ' my original order ( which , given the size of the box is an achievement in itself ) but customer_services did an outstanding job of diagnosing the cause of delay and remedying the situation in the shortest_possible timescale once i ' d alerted them to the problem .
neutral	recommend .
neutral	just not long moved back to vodafone contract after a long , long time on o0
neutral	one major gripe i have with vodafone is the garbage customer service , imho calling them from a vodafone mobile should be free not charged at local rate .... it is free from a landline !
neutral	!
neutral	had a text_message_saying funds had been transferred , nothing has arrived in my account !
neutral	now thinking cashgenie will still try and take the repayment even_though i didn_'_t recieve the loan .
neutral	product was great but i ordered on thursday am & paid for next_day delivery but it didn_'_t arrive until the monday
neutral	i would still use the online shopping service provided but am aware of possible occasional disappointment .
neutral	for most stuff ebay and amazon are cheapest , but ebay work with paypal that can cause problems when selling .
neutral	also selling fees are stupidly high !
neutral	did the job but for a £_00 top up that should have cost £_00 , i had to pay a transaction charge of 00p .
neutral	whilst not a huge fee , a £_00 purchase should cost £_00 .
neutral	i won_'_t be using this sevice again .
neutral	the booking was all fine .
neutral	the hotel was good with friendly staff , apart_from breakfast host who did not look me in the eye when he spoke to me , and he called me madam !!!
neutral	i am clearly a mr !!
neutral	!
neutral	we booked through amoma and it stated breakfast included .
neutral	it wasn_'_t until we went to breakfast room that we were told by the gender confused man that we had continental breakfast included , not full english , it would have cost an extra £_00 per head .
neutral	other wise a good , convenient place to stay .
neutral	had to contact recipient of order to ascertain if delivery had been received .
neutral	confirmation of saturday delivery received electronically the following wednesday !
neutral	although this of good quality material and was marked up a a medium_size , beware it '_s massive !
neutral	i have a 0 ring burner size medium bar - b - q .
neutral	this cover would fit over 0 of them !
neutral	just be aware when ordering !
neutral	easy to order and good information on website .
neutral	kept_informed about time of delivery etc .
neutral	however , person delivered item to next door as did not bother to ring the doorbell , made extra work and inconvenience for everyone .
neutral	i was upstairs at the time and waiting for the delivery .
neutral	i found it hard to find a number to contact anyone as there was no number left on the card pushed through the letterbox .
neutral	i eventually got through to someone at your customer service but they didn_'_t seem very interested .
neutral	ordered last thursday , just too late to get dispatch that day , but was advised order had been dispatched friday - got tracking_information and everything .
neutral	tried to track today , but no information , so rang bdw only to be told that one of the products that i had ordered ( one they had specifically emailed me about to tell me it was back in stock ), had not come into stock until friday at 0 . 00 pm meaning that my order was not dispatched at all .
neutral	they had not contacted me to advise me of this delay , and would presumably have just let_me arrive home tonight to find my dog without food .
neutral	i really am not impressed with this experience , and will almost certainly use a local supplier from now on .
neutral	revised rating following the apology from the company , and some compensation .
neutral	still feel there are aspects of this experience that could have easily been avoided .
neutral	i have used your services for many_years and recommended to family and friends .
neutral	however this time couple of hiccups .
neutral	first of all 00_euros extra charged for a late pick_up - don_'_t consider 0000 late and this charge was mentioned nowhere .
neutral	also there was a challenge over the petrol level on return and an argument all for 0 euros .
neutral	disappointed and it has left me misled on pricing .
neutral	i run regular speed tests on a bunch of services .
neutral	this one is much like all the others .
neutral	except when it takes time to load .
neutral	( like today .)
neutral	no better , no worse .
neutral	never rely_on a single source for this sort of data .
neutral	never received the product the first time .
neutral	had to go to royal_mail depot to find out it wasnt there wasted time and petrol .
neutral	they posted a replacement which arrived on time .
neutral	usrd this co a few_times and helped_me out when needed .
neutral	i booked tickets and everything worked ok but i can '_t see why the site is any better_than rail_europe .
neutral	we ' re travelling from the uk to barcelona .
neutral	one thing i ' d like the site to do is to show fares for a whole week or month in the way that some airlines like jet0 do .
neutral	i spent hours considering various_options .
neutral	if something like that is possible , i ' d definitely use the site .
neutral	bag arrived and looked great .
neutral	played nine wholes and went to retrieve tees from bag to find pocket empty .
neutral	stitching in top pocket where balls would be kept below had no stitching .
neutral	manufacturer fault or damaged ?
neutral	the flowers were decent but not very many for the price and didnt look like the image at all .
neutral	chose mainly pinks for mothers_day and it was mainly bland colours when they arrived .
neutral	although i was only 0nd in line it still took an_eternity to take the details and fill out the forms for the person in front of me ( at_least 00_mins , part of this was to do with the lady wanting to read through all the t &_c and examine the detail of all the scratches , dinks and dents on the car she was taking , when my turn came it still took at_least 00_mins , in , fairness it is the same with almost every rental company , by the time i was finished the queue was 00 deep , those at the back would be waiting for an_hour , there has to be a better way
neutral	the first delivery had a fault running through it
neutral	the replacement wasnt finished properly
neutral	i got round it by routing an edge top and bottom
neutral	when i oiled it i then saw a seperation in the staves which is visable
neutral	i am hoping that it wont effect the finished job but it is not satisfactory
neutral	if i hadnt joined it and cut out the hob i would have sent it back
neutral	i had a lot of trouble getting parcel_force to give me a straight answer on where the package was .
neutral	nothing but " top floor_flat " was written on the delivery note .
neutral	i really think rollersnakes should use collect_plus , would have been much_easier .
neutral	overall through products are really good though .
neutral	have used the company for years and am very impressed with the efficiency of the booking pick_up etc , however this time the internal cleanliness of the car left a lot to be desired , even clothing was marked if catching the door frames on entry / exit . hope this was a one off .
neutral	where '_s my top_cashback for transaction 000000 ?
neutral	very quick and easy to do .
neutral	payment was prompt but could have got a better deal from another company
neutral	overall the service was reasonable , we bought a substancial amount of furniture , however had i known that i had to unpack this i don_'_t think i would have bought it .
neutral	great products at a great price .
neutral	swift delivery to my home in norway .
neutral	my only_negative_comment is the lack of availability of the free tm golf_bag as advertised with new tm irons .
neutral	golfonline offered to ship the golf_bag later for an additional_fee of gbp 00 .
neutral	poor service !
neutral	was recommended this company by a friend who said the bouquet she got her mum was " huge & great value for money ".
neutral	the order i got was the bright_blue_orchids ( i think ) and the boquet was tiny .
neutral	it was the £_00 ( ish_) one so maybe i should have expected it but you really need a scale on there so we know .
neutral	i will say the delivery system they use is brilliant .
neutral	thought the prices were steep !
neutral	paid 0x the face value without knowing until the tickets arrived .
neutral	im_sure the event will be great but i probably wouldnt use again .
neutral	dont like to be ripped_off .
neutral	as a returning customer a confidently placed an order on 00 / 00 / 00 for delivery on 0 / 0 / 00 .
neutral	it did not arrive .
neutral	after communication with pinesolutions i was eventually told by a manager it was my fault as they had not put the full address on parcel
neutral	i am on their mailing_list as well
neutral	conclusion ; good product poor customer service / support
neutral	i can '_t fault the glasses , they seem to be well made and the prescription spot on .
neutral	but ...
neutral	after 00 days of hearing_nothing , i sent an e_- mail for an order update .
neutral	admittedly it was on a saturday - and received only an_automated_response .
neutral	by tuesday a . m . still heard_nothing , so chased again .
neutral	russ came back to me to say sorry and that there had been a problem with a lens .
neutral	the glasses were dispatched on the wednesday , and actually arrived on the thursday - which is very good .
neutral	two suggestions would be : a ) if there are problems , just a short e_- mail to the customer really helps , and b ) if an order is being chased , again a simple " human " response would be appreciated , even if it just says " we ' re looking into it ".
neutral	the amount of stuff you have on here is incredible !
neutral	but the navigation on the site using an ipad is tough , slow and moving back and forth_between item views and lists is a painful process .
neutral	that said , the transaction process was nice and smooth .
neutral	what can i say about musclefood . com excellent as always .
neutral	highly_recommend try it once and you will not go_elsewhere .
neutral	top quality produce time and time again .
neutral	i ordered two wall - mounted spots earlier this year .
neutral	they were excellent , so i ordered two more .
neutral	these two arrived , but i found that one was not adjustable in rotation about its stem - just tilted .
neutral	inspecting it , i found that the stem had been sealed to the base by a glob of hard black_plastic " putty "
neutral	i telephoned juice who were mystified ; they ordered a replacement , which took nearly a month to arrive .
neutral	to my consternation , the replacement was similarly blocked from rotating , and clearly there has_been a retrograde design change , rendering the light very much less useful as a wall spot light .
neutral	very disappointing and log drawn - out process
neutral	hello ,
neutral	i set_up this company last night and at 00 : 00 today i have not et received my company registration_number despite the service being advertised as only taking 0 hours .
neutral	i would appreciate an explanation of what is causing the delay .
neutral	thank_you
neutral	john
neutral	i was frustrated that the jigraphy title on the puzzle wasn_'_t on the top as in the picture on the box but at the side .
neutral	i never like puzzles that don_'_t hold apart at the edges .
neutral	i would have liked thicker cardboard .
neutral	upgrade nag screens ruin my experience of bd .
neutral	you have no business spamming me like that - as a result i will not be renewing .
neutral	we got there in the end ... after a couple of early communication hiccups .
neutral	i wanted to check that the club i ' d ordered was left_handed and when i got no response to my email , i checked the website and it appeared that my order had been cancelled .
neutral	i re - ordered ... and found myself receiving two items .
neutral	to be fair , both items were delivered within a few_days and i was told that i could return the extra item .
neutral	however , i got no response to my request for a return mailing address .
neutral	overall , nordica provides a good service in terms of delivery but i think they need to work on their communication .
neutral	oh , and i still have the second item !
neutral	i ordered 000 bulbs and have used 00 so_far and 0 were broken
neutral	best price on the comparison site however after sending recorded delivery which was signed for i never received an update .
neutral	i contacted them the following_day and was initially told it hadn_'_t arrived but after giving them the tracking_number they confirmed delivery .
neutral	( what would have happened i hadn_'_t sent it recorded delivery !).
neutral	an email was sent saying they were testing it and would update when completed , nothing received .
neutral	i contacted them again by which time it had been a total of thirteen days to process the order , a credit was paid into my account within a few hours of me chasing it up .
neutral	i don_'_t think there is any intent to not pay but the whole_process was very slow and perhaps the xmas_period didn_'_t help .
neutral	also if you are in a rush don_'_t wait for their envelope to arrive , mine took six days by which time i had already sent it .
neutral	i decided to buy simplyboradband after some_research , dispite negative_comments on customer service .
neutral	everything_went well until i was given an activation date .
neutral	i got the impression you could choose your date .
neutral	i am with bt and my contract finishes 00rd_june .
neutral	friends have taked 0_weeks to swap service , so i decided to buy today .
neutral	at the end of the process i was given a date of 00th_may for my service to start .
neutral	however , this date will break my current bt contract .
neutral	no mention of a start date is given until the end of the process !
neutral	i contacted live_chat ( which was only 0 - 0 mins , much_better_than the old telephone service ) but peter the opperator stated he is unalble to change the system generated date !
neutral	my only option appears to be i have to cancel my order and rebook next month , having to go through the whole_process again !!
neutral	most unsatisfactory .
neutral	the cost of the rental was reasonable and although it was a nuisance to have to pay a one way fee i understand the reason .
neutral	the southampton office was efficient , the staff pleasant and helpful .
neutral	the car was first_class , very clean and economical .
neutral	the reception at drop_off in carlisle was efficient , simple and the staff were courteous and very helpful .
neutral	before going ashore from our ship in southampton i tried the alamo helpline number i was given .
neutral	i wanted to enquire the exact whereabouts of the pickup_point and ask if there was a shuttle service to and from the port .
neutral	the telephone_number shown on the booking confirmation was no_longer operational and a recorded_message gave a premium_rate number which cost even more from a mobile_phone .
neutral	this was not a good start .
neutral	it became worse when the alamo help_desk person had no idea where the pickup or drop_off was .
neutral	she clearly had no idea about the locations and offered no help at all other than giving another premium_rate number to call .
neutral	i was very unimpressed by the whole_process which wasted time and money with no useful outcome .
neutral	bali hai bought for the wife for valentine '_s day .
neutral	impeccable service from serenata , as usual , and delivered exactly as requested .
neutral	huge box added to anticipation but i was a little disappointed at the contents , which could have been fitted in a box half the size .
neutral	although the wife was delighted with the thought it was more of a posy than a bunch and i felt the wow_factor , i have experienced previously , was missing on this occasion .
neutral	for me the product didn_'_t quite live up to the marketing promise and pictures and was rather expensive to boot .
neutral	i have placed 0 orders with wbn to date , 0 of which where processed speedily and were exactly_what i needed .
neutral	by the third order however , wbn seemed to forget i was a previous customer and blanked me ... not good .
neutral	was very happy with the price and service from tyre_shopper , even_though the tyres i ordered happened to be out of stock .
neutral	i was however contacted promptly and offered an_alternative .
neutral	national_tyres in broughty ferry however were rude , of poor service and slow .
neutral	this has tainted my experience using ts and will probably not use them again unless they add another garage local to myself .
neutral	preferably arbroath !
neutral	i ordered some shorts on 00th_may 0000 which arrived a few_days_later .
neutral	however , they were the wrong shorts ( not what i ordered ) so having called them up and been told to return them for a replacement , they were returned on 00th_may .
neutral	a week goes by , and no replacement shorts are delivered , so i email them on the 0th_june asking where my replacement shorts were .
neutral	in the email i am told " your replacement shorts will be with you in the next few_days .".
neutral	great , so i wait .. and wait ... on 00th , i email again asking for a tracking_number , but i get no reply .
neutral	on the 00th_june i call and actually speak to the md , who seems like a very nice man , who_apologised for the delay in the delivery , and that they would definitely be with me within 00_hours , by saturday .
neutral	saturday comes and still no delivery - i call them on saturday_afternoon but there was no - one in customer_services to speak to , so a message was left for them to call me on monday .
neutral	monday arrives , and i do indeed get a phone_call , and again i get lots of apologies , but even_though i had been assured by the managing_director that they would be with my on the previous saturday , they admitted they were still in the packing department .
neutral	at this point , i decided enough was enough and asked for a refund .
neutral	i simply could not trust them to send me the item .
neutral	the refund at_least did go through smoothly .
neutral	my problem with fatbirds ( apart_from the fact they made a mistake with the original order and failed to send me the replacement at all ) is that i was told things in e_- mails which were not true .
neutral	assurances were made over the phone which were not kept .
neutral	i simply cannot recommend this company to anyone because they had so many opportunities to make things right but failed .
neutral	having said that , when i did speak to them , they were courteous and apologetic and i did eventually get a refund so i cannot give them a very low rating , but beware , if you have problems with your original order , expect a long wait to get it sorted .
neutral	the prices are good compared to other_places , but what is wrong with there delivery options ?!
neutral	i ordered a in - stock rat 0 mouse , delivery was expected after 00 - 00 working_days !
neutral	ridiculous_amount of time required !
neutral	overall , i would recommend that you try them out at_least once for the good range of flavours they have - which was my primary_reason for using them .
neutral	just allow a few extra days for delivery and hope that you ordered a good flavour :)
neutral	i will most_likely use them again thanks to some of their prices and range of flavours , just hope next time the flavours i choose taste more like they should be ;)
neutral	always use interparcel and have done for about 0 years .
neutral	00_% of time i go for ups option as always seems to be delivered next_day .
neutral	only issues are and i point out this has only happened 0 or 0 times is when you have to deal with customer_services , for example when a parcel has not been picked_up when it should have .
neutral	twice i have been penalised by my customer for late delivery because a parcel has not been picked_up via interparcel .
neutral	speaking with customer_services about these issues at the time i found 0 particular girl so rude and with a terrible ' well that '_s tough and your problem attitude ' i was left speechless .
neutral	there was no compensation offered which therr should have been or even an_apology of any type .
neutral	with all that said i will_continue to use .
neutral	as above
neutral	end of
neutral	item not posted promptly and they use the over priced parcelforce service .
neutral	i have always appreciated national_tyre .
neutral	this time i needed to speak to the central call_centre .
neutral	there was a lot of background_noise which is normal but the assistant could have been more pleasant and helpful in dealing_with my query about what speed rating i needed or what a s / r was .
neutral	perhaps he didn_'_t know ?
neutral	i always get god service at the high_wycombe branch .
neutral	website good .
neutral	bought a great petzl head_torch , very happy with it .
neutral	package came within delivery time specified by simply_hike - thank_you .
neutral	just need to say that the package had a hole in the back and was pretty badly scuffed up , including two dirty boot prints on it !
neutral	please talk to your dpd driver , gary .
neutral	the head_torch packaging itself was also slightly crushed , fortunately head_torch itself wasn_'_t damaged .
neutral	having navigated the site and got to the purchase screens it confirmed 0 and not the 0 seats requested .
neutral	it did this on 0 occasions , so it wasn_'_t ' pilot error '.
neutral	also , when looking for quotes it returned a route / time that when i went to book it didnt actually exist for that operator
neutral	basic errors that should be resolved during testing
neutral	i think the service is good but the constant harrasment on the phone to the guarentor is the reason we proberbly won_'_t use you again .
neutral	i think our guarantor who is 00 years old must of been rang at_least 00 times in 0 days .
neutral	that just isn_'_t good enough .
neutral	the order was wrongly despatched as only 0 box was sent and it should have been 0 boxes , as i had paid upfront by debit_card it was down to me to then re contact rajapack to point out the error .
neutral	this was then rectified .
neutral	flower were good timing was great but the teddy was rubbish
neutral	the teddy was vacuum_packed and was meant to spring into action when unpacked but alas he needed cpr and mouth to mouth resuscitation .
neutral	over all good but let_down by detail ??
neutral	?
neutral	the products i purchased are up to what i expected
neutral	i know that i will recommend products , but i fear that the price will be an obstacle to regular purchases .
neutral	sorry for my bad english ...
neutral	had an enjoyable stay here at the dutchman hotel breakfast nice didn_'_t eat here but the food smelt lovely when we arrived overall would recommend if you like 0 * ratings then maybe this isn_'_t the hotel for you .
neutral	nothing extravagant but a great cheap hotel enjoyed it very much
neutral	ordered two products , although on the delivery note , weren_'_t delivered on the same day , although not a major thing , i did think something was missing from the delivery , maybe not their fault but the couriers .
neutral	when second item was delivered the box was ripped right open and roof_bars scratched all over .
neutral	good have been wrapped up a lot better , but again could be couriers fault .
neutral	item now not in stock so have to wait 0 / 0_weeks .
neutral	seen there has_been a few different feedbacks about damaged goods , maybe they should change courier and make experience for customer better .
neutral	came through to this website via sky_scanner , where i put in dates for the 00th to the 00th .
neutral	was about to book when i noticed that on this site , my dates had changed to 00th to the 0th .
neutral	luckily i noticed !
neutral	i like the range of products - but they are at close to list price on most of it .
neutral	very expensive .
neutral	the fact they only use parcel_force for delivery is a big minus for me - as parcel_force are notoriously bad service and very inconvenient and un - trackable .
neutral	they drop parcels at local post_offices , who then charge you further for taking delivery .
neutral	frost stock some great american stuff , which im happy to pay for , rather_than get cheaper from the us ( and then wait longer for delivery ) - but they just need to use a more professional logistics company .
neutral	if you pay by paypal you do not get the instant order confirmation page .
neutral	and because the email_confirmations take_forever to come you can '_t tell if you have ordered twice .
neutral	the customer service staff cannot see the order for over half an_hour which means they cannot deal with any errors straight_away .
neutral	consequently it takes a lot of phone_calls , half the day and wasted time to sort this out .
neutral	i have used transglobal_express twice_now , and on both_occasions the same thing happened . i was charged for a door to door service but the delivery company in this sinstance simply called me and told me to come pick_up my package . it was never delivered to me and i had to go the extra_expense of going to pick it up
neutral	delivery was a bit_slow and misleading - 0 - 0 working_days became two_weeks , and status_updates didn_'_t help .
neutral	what does ' stock allocated ' mean ?
neutral	where '_s my stuff ?
neutral	it arrived intact eventually though .
neutral	super pour_les_délais_de_livraison trés rapide mais j ' ai_du payer des frais_de douanes
neutral	the iphone 0 is fantastic .
neutral	but phones0u added the wrong data bolt on to the package .
neutral	o0 sorted this out but i had no data connection for 0 days .
neutral	other than that i had no issues .
neutral	even you use fedex , not expect to have speed delivery .
neutral	it takes time and not to mention about the tax .
neutral	the product is very good - i haven_'_t tasted anything that i haven_'_t really liked .
neutral	service is not so good though - im still_waiting for my latest order after well over a week .
neutral	also they have a discount policy which is very confusing and i have been " cheated " out of a discount_code on one occasion which i was not happy about .
neutral	i ordered two radiators and thermostatic valves , which were delivered within a couple of days .
neutral	great price and look really good .
neutral	only_snag was that the couriers van was involved in an accident , and no one called me to let_me know that they would not arrive in the time_slot_allocated , so had to wait an extra 0 hours .
neutral	but would not detract_from ordering from trueshopping again .
neutral	having ordered a lovely - looking bunch of roses and lilies for my sister '_s 00th_birthday , i had expected that i would be able to add a second gift , a pot of bromeliads , in a straight - forward way .
neutral	sadly , it wasn_'_t so - perhaps i missed the vital link - so i ended_up having to give my sister '_s name and address a second time .
neutral	moreover , tho ' my two gifts are to be delivered to the same person on the same day ( her_birthday ) at the same address , it appears that i have been charged for two_separate_deliveries !
neutral	that seems to me to be an unjustifiable case of over - charging , and has spoiled an otherwise - agreeable experience .
neutral	and now i seems to be unable to post my review !
neutral	i have doubts_about the actual size of the bunches (+ luxury options ) i bought .
neutral	i think they could have been smaller than shown .
neutral	the supply once the order had been successfully taken was very easy , the ordering_process is difficult especially with not being_able to place a order via the shop .
neutral	extension application tools are very poor quality and look very cheap as if one touch will break them .
neutral	the glue gun , as if you buy straight from the makers company would be half the price .
neutral	waste if money
neutral	this is the cheapest dive_equipment website i can find and i have always been impressed with the quality of the products .
neutral	however , it took quite a while for the package to be dispatched and needed me to chase for it to be sent .
neutral	luckily i wasn_'_t in a massive rush
neutral	i used twice the service of booking . com and from customers point of view all was good .
neutral	however after_speaking with couple of friends working in hotels , i got a different perspective of booking . com methods , that are very aggressive , particularly against small independent hotels .
neutral	flowers and chocs good , if expensive , but they couldn_'_t deliver on the stated day .
neutral	ok , it was easter , and a last_minute order , so maybe this is partly my fault .
neutral	at_least they phoned to let_me know , but then they didn_'_t know there was a florist on their network in the hospital i was ordering for !
neutral	also , no feedback to let you know the delivery had been made .
neutral	in short flowers good , service not so good .
neutral	beautybay has good prices overall , but it takes loooong time to get the delivery .
neutral	about 0 - 0 , 0_weeks longer_than normal internet orders .
neutral	it was very easy to order the garage_door liftmaster 000 on line .
neutral	i was notified of the delivery day and time !
neutral	by e_- mail and what is unbelievable it arrived the day after and spot on time .
neutral	everything to this point was very professional and an enjoyable_experience .
neutral	when installed the lm 000 would not work and would not allow me to set the travel limits .
neutral	having made many calls to easygate i had to rely_on the e_- mail system for advice but when i received the reply it directed me to contact [_link ].
neutral	what followed was less_than customer friendly .
neutral	call after call after call was rejected and it took 0 days before making contact with some one who just said it was the photo cells and there had been a change in eu legislation and then rang off .
neutral	i tried to re establish contact without_success and finally i gave up .
neutral	i did eventually work it out but it had now taken 0 days which was much longer_than the acquisition process .
neutral	total_lack of technical_support for a complex piece of equipment .
neutral	it spoilt the whole_process . and left a bad_taste
neutral	as someone_who has made several orders through affordable_supplements ’ website in the past i have always been satisfied with their service .
neutral	however , following my latest purchase i felt disappointed and slightly angered .
neutral	i made a purchase online in the usual way without_any_problems and then waited for my product to be delivered .
neutral	i received an e_- mail from the sales_team giving a delivery date for the following_day and that i “ should ensure that someone was available to sing for the parcel ”.
neutral	therefore , i made sure that i would be about the house to sign for the parcel .
neutral	i did not want to have to go to a depot to collect the parcel as i have had to do in the past when i ’ ve missed the delivery ; this is an even bigger inconvenience .
neutral	the delivery day came and went without a sign of the delivery person .
neutral	i felt i had wasted a day waiting for the delivery and was mislead by the e_- mail that i had received by the affordable_supplements sales_team .
neutral	what frustrated me further was that i would probably have to wait for most of the next_day waiting again .
neutral	to my relief the parcel was delivery around_midday the next_day .
neutral	i got in touch with affordable_supplements to complain and they said that they would get in touch with the delivery company to see what went wrong .
neutral	affordable_supplements went on to say that they usually receive compensation from the delivery company for late deliveries and they would then pass that amount on to me .
neutral	i have yet to receive anything .
neutral	in my opinion , when an e_- mail is sent stating the delivery day it should most definitely be delivered on that day .
neutral	further , if it were possible , that e_- mail should state if it was going to be delivered in the morning or afternoon .
neutral	at_least then , if something_goes_wrong , someone hasn_’_t wasted a whole day at home .
neutral	i ordered rayban frames .
neutral	delivery was speedy .
neutral	glasses were very competitively_priced however the lenses are really hard to clean as they are plastic .
neutral	on pich up there was quite a queue due to the system having crashed and they had no back up plan to do antything manual - they also tried to fob me off with a car ( chevrolet spark ) that was at_least a class lower_than the one i thought i ' d booked ( opel_astra ) but managed to give me a perfectly good car that was apparently in the same class ( chevrolet_aveo ).
neutral	after that the car was absolutely perfect so no_complaints .
neutral	parts delivered fast .
neutral	no_probs glad to have done business with you will use again .
neutral	no_problems with this order although the lead time was longer_than i would have liked and it was hard to tell when it was coming .
neutral	my company is based on the isle of man and we ship all our larger_parcels through interparcel .
neutral	we have found our orders can easily be forgotten and collection and delivery is an additional 0 days due to an outside contractor collecting the order .
neutral	when orders have been forgotten about we follow_up with a phone_call .
neutral	from the phone_call we can almost always get a solution .
neutral	it is now our policy to call after_placing an order .
neutral	i get the impression that this doesn_'_t speed anything up and there is no procedure in place to deal with island orders .
neutral	our last trip with dfds was a return_journey to holland starting in may and returning in june .
neutral	the outward_trip was not as advertised in that we had paid for a two bed cabin with sea_view .
neutral	what we actually got was a single bed and three tier bunk_bed .
neutral	at our age the bunk_bed is neither comfortable or safe .
neutral	given that i did not get a good night '_s sleep it meant that i struggled to complete my scheduled journey from ijmuiden .
neutral	the supposed reason for this was that the ship was carrying several school trips .
neutral	to be fair to the children , they were very well behaved .
neutral	however , we still feel that this was sharp_practice by dfds .
neutral	the return trip was better in that we got the type of cabin and beds we had booked .
neutral	we noticed that again we seemed to be in a minority using the explorer '_s restaurant , probably due to the limited menu and price .
neutral	i bought several items of oak_furniture , all of which were extremely heavy and cumberome .
neutral	it was also very dangerous as i could easily have got crushed under the 000 kg wardrobe if it was to fall over on top of me .
neutral	company only seemed interested in delivering as many sales as possible in one day with little thought to the health and safety of customers .
neutral	the petmeds site was the most competitive on the web for our dog '_s medication .
neutral	unfortunately despite saying they had been dispatched , nothing arrived .
neutral	this could of course be down to the postal service so i wait with interest how it will be resolved .
neutral	'_m not happy about what i wrote on questions into order message only say thank_you for ordering where ask my question
neutral	thank_you
neutral	paul
neutral	flowers were not as per picture on web_site .
neutral	presentation was not as good as previous_orders .
neutral	card was poorly_written
neutral	disappointed as tyres advertised & purchased were not available
neutral	so many belgium footbal fans was so loud .
neutral	they shouted and sang .
neutral	nobody from crew say nothing to this people .
neutral	i was little disappointed .
neutral	they have good products and prices on most stuff .
neutral	ordered over phone and went well .
neutral	only when i enquired_about price match did i get a problem .
neutral	i gave the details of product i found cheaper , and they said they will get back to following_day .
neutral	0 days_later and numerous phone_calls did i get a reply , then the item was of " different quality ".
neutral	when i asked for explanation they couldn_'_t give one
neutral	when i looked for prices for my old phone , orange came up at the top of the list .
neutral	i was happy with the service , but not happy i did not receive the full price originally offered .
neutral	you stated small cosmetic_damage was acceptable first , but then offered less stating cosmetic_damage .
neutral	overall t mobile have offered a good reliable service , with good coverage over most of the uk , however they do seem prone to changing their price structure at the drop of a hat , and their contact number has also changed .
neutral	being a bit of an old fogie i prefer stability in my service providers .
neutral	overall they are good but could do better !
neutral	excellent kit , pity about the service and the length of time it took to receive it .
neutral	i had to ' chase ' the order and the response was not too forthcoming - i think that this is a weakness and needs attention , other than that i like what was delivered .
neutral	everything in the experience was very good .
neutral	good website , easy to use , prompt .
neutral	only issue was when the goods came the box was very battered , bit of a problem as a gift .
neutral	i use rentalcars a lot - as i rent a car somewhere ( mostly in europe ) almost every week .
neutral	booking is quick and painless .
neutral	but beware - it seems that " on airport " does not mean what you and i think it will .
neutral	normally i ' d give at_least four_stars , so to punish one shockingly_bad_experience by ignoring everything that has_gone right in the past and only giving one star now is not entirely fair .
neutral	but make no mistake rentalcars ( if you ' re reading this ), i '_m really p **** d off with you .
neutral	collecting an " on airport " car at stockholm arlanda .
neutral	can '_t find the car_rental desks .
neutral	why - because you have to get on a bus to a depot beside one of the long_term car_parks .
neutral	so , i '_m stood in the freezing_cold waiting for a bus ( having finally found the right stop just in time to see one depart ), and phoned rentalcars .
neutral	clearly - the guy i spoke to was not interested in listening to the facts .
neutral	he offered to rebook me with an " on airport " rental company - both of whom were served by the bus i was stood waiting for .
neutral	but - he still insisted they were " on airport " and that is was my fault i was stood waiting for a bus .
neutral	apparently i should have checked the address of the depot before booking .
neutral	but you can '_t do that even if you want to - because you don_'_t know who the car comes from until after you have made the booking .
neutral	and even then - the address was a po_box number - how are you supposed to find it anyway ?
neutral	besides - for other bookings with them that are " off airport " in the past - they are very specific about where to go to collect the car ( even_though on occasion this has_been wrong ).
neutral	so i think stockholm arlanda is at_least one location where they don_'_t actually have a clue about the logistics of what is going on at the airport .
neutral	" off airport " is always cheaper , but normally slower ( because of the need to catch a bus ).
neutral	but on this occasion would have been cheaper , with no time penalty .
neutral	possibly saving time even , because i wouldn_'_t have wasted the time i did trying to find out where i should be going .
neutral	this guy was far more interested in insisting that he was right and i was wrong , than listen to the facts .
neutral	i asked to speak to someone to make a complaint - he told me it had to be in writing .
neutral	so i asked to speak to his_supervisor - and was told that the supervisor would not speak to me ( this , without having consulted said supervisor ).
neutral	i insisted on speaking to the supervisor to make a complaint about his conduct on the call - and that it was not his place to refuse such a request .
neutral	surprisingly enough , the call got cut_off when he was " transferring " me .
neutral	and despite the fact that i know he had my number to call me back - he didn_'_t do so .
neutral	sorry rentalcars - when you screw up ( as you undeniably did on this one ), take_responsibility .
neutral	don_'_t blame the customer for the fact that you have bad information to hand - and then refuse to listen to the correct information ( so you can update your records and not do the same to anyone_else in the future ).
neutral	thanks for wasting half an_hour of my time to stand outside in the rain and cold - when i had neither the time nor inclination so late in the evening to spare for it .
neutral	customer service on this occasion didn_'_t even register a score .
neutral	sorry .
neutral	it was fairly_straightforward to use with a variety of options but be careful to check everything .
neutral	.. not sure if it was me or them but some of the pages were in the wrong order .
neutral	however i am pleased with the final book but will need to think carefully about the cost next time .
neutral	some very interesting offers , but their service , when you need to speak to someone is pretty poor .
neutral	paid promptly but reduced the agreed price by five pounds because they said they did not have my bank details .
neutral	i have read elsewhere that other people have complained of similar reductions .
neutral	i wouldn_'_t use them again on principal .
neutral	experience of store purchases is good , see what i like , try it on for size and if fine , i purchase it .
neutral	this was the first attempt at online ordering but it turns_out i am in between your sizes for the coat i wanted .
neutral	but after returning the coat and receiving confirmation they have been received , i am still_waiting for my money back 0_weeks_later .
neutral	if transfers are only made at a certain point in the month ( to keep down bacs charges ) ted_baker should make it known when these are .
neutral	obviously it '_s never as good as the display , but it was just a little too below standard for me to be satisfied .
neutral	my girlfriend , however , very much liked the sentiment and thought they looked quite good , so i guess it did the job .
neutral	bought noise cancellation headphones .
neutral	however at times the create vibrations sounds which defeats the objective of them .
neutral	will see if this settles down , if not , i '_ll have to send them back , as suspected faulty , or just a poor product .
neutral	disappointing as reviews i read sounded very good and great value product .
neutral	lindy buying experience was very good .
neutral	hopefully their customer service will be also should i return them
neutral	a huge_range of products available but no depth of customer service ; the whole_experience feels very impersonal .
neutral	no_frills , cheap flights to european destinations .
neutral	when price is more important than luxury .
neutral	recently have purchased 0 pairs of glasses , first pair - frames not available - very little feedback , except when i sent emails .
neutral	eventually_settled for inferior frames which were only just about adequate and took 0_weeks .
neutral	second pair , more prompt , but unsure_about quality of frames , ok at momemt , but time will tell .
neutral	my first order and wanted the items delivered to an_alternative address .
neutral	emailed but was informed that i couldn_'_t change the delivery address from anything other than the payment address to help prevent fraud .
neutral	i accept this , but would have been useful to have that made clear on the website when purchasing .
neutral	additionally , while i received the first item within a week , i '_m still_waiting for the second item over a fortnight later - it was out of stock and they are awaiting delivery from the manufacturer , but have still taken my cash .
neutral	if out of stock , it should be made clear on the site .
neutral	i would use again , but will take more care over finding out if an item is in stock first .
neutral	ordered set of drawers expected delivery as agreed to be to my house , that being my front_door in my home .
neutral	not at the bottom of the common close , but they did to be fair rectify this and build my furniture for £_00 .
neutral	but this took 0_weeks !!!!
neutral	!
neutral	please morale you are a great shop offering quality just make things more transparent initially .
neutral	so_far the system has paid back over £_000 in cashback , but it has taken a few support emails to chase up some payments .
neutral	generally_speaking , you need to be very patient and some of my cashback has taken over a year to be paid .
neutral	quidco allows some supplier nine_months grace for paying cashback - i don_'_t think that '_s acceptable .
neutral	so , it '_s a way to get money back , but you will need to be really patient and it can be a pain chasing up tiny payments that don_'_t get paid without giving quidco a nudge .
neutral	there have been some great companies that have paid cashback quickly and who can argue with getting back £_000 that i might never otherwise have had ?
neutral	when you in a hurry my opinion is not help by having to do this and not being_able to pass and not fill this in
neutral	got a message to say that the product was to be delivered on this particular day but the website it referred me to seemed to have lost the item or sent it somewhere_else .
neutral	whatever i decided not to stay in and sent e_- mails to both companies .
neutral	no one replied with what was happening - i only got an e_- mail ( basically the same one from the courier and the vendor ) at the beginning of the next_day saying that the part would be delivered that day .
neutral	unfortunately i was out all that day but fortunately returned 00_minutes before the item was delivered .
neutral	at the end of the day all was well and the product works_fine .
neutral	but it could have gone_wrong spectacularly .
neutral	the reply_below was well received .
neutral	thank_you .
neutral	this experience won_'_t put me off as in most_cases described in these reviews everything_went well .
neutral	i assume i must just have been unlucky !
neutral	the ordering and delivery process was efficient , but some of the roses had wilted and will not last long .
neutral	well , i typically use interlink_express for most of my business sales .
neutral	however they have dropped a few of my packages and it has cost me , so i decided to try collect_plus again because i used them before .
neutral	some of my sales are printers , around 0kg in medium to large boxes , 00 x 00 x 00 cm .
neutral	the corner store chap_who i dropped them off with was understandabley a little_weary as he only has a small shop and little storage_space .
neutral	so now i drop them off at another corner_shop that i know has larger store space .
neutral	its good for a few smaller parcels or the occasional large parcel , but i can see that there are limits on large_quantities .
neutral	one of the great things is delivery to outlying spots that normal couriers won_'_t touch or that will charge a lot for , like the highlands .
neutral	as for me and the use in my business , i will use the service but may combine it with another courier to get the right mix of services .
neutral	initially i was very pleased with the swift delivery of my worktops but when my kitchen installer took the plastic_wrapping off we found some imperfections in the block construction .
neutral	thankfully my installer was able to work around these imperfections when installing the worktops to minimise the impact on the top surface by positioning at the sink_cut out and on the underside elsewhere .
neutral	worktop_express did eventually agree to give me a token of compensation but it was not alot .
neutral	had i raised the issue immediatley on delivery the response may have been better .
neutral	my recommendation is to take time to carefully inspect the products on delivery and run your hands over the complete surface is essential to check they are flat .
neutral	was disappointed with the help i got after part of order was damaged / undelivered and the service of the phone helpline as took a ridiculous_amount of time to get through to them .
neutral	also the meat is good though .
neutral	would have liked some kind of compensation for the order as i had to go out to get the bit i didn_'_t receive from the shops as had a bbq the weekend it was meant to be delivered .
neutral	my experience was fine .
neutral	not amazing or exceptional , just fine .
neutral	my order was dispatched later than it should '_ve been as they were awaiting stock ( despite the website showing in stock at the time i ordered ).
neutral	when the item i ordered arrived ( a set of six placemats ), i noticed one placemat was missing .
neutral	i telephoned customer service straightaway and spoke to a guy_who didn_'_t really seem overly bothered .
neutral	i didn_'_t receive an_apology for their mistake , but , to give them their due , they did dispatch the missing placemat to me straightaway .
neutral	based on this experience , i probably_won_'_t use them again .
neutral	bought a camera and card from this supplier .
neutral	the price was good and the items showed as in stock .
neutral	after 00 days i had nothing but an intial acknowledgement of the sale .
neutral	i rang their customer service number and was told they would email me that day with an explanation of what the delay was .
neutral	they emailed the day after that to say the items were being despatched .
neutral	the camera arrived the following_day but no card was sent .
neutral	( the delivery note onbly included the camera ).
neutral	they sent me a further email a day later after an enquiry into the card to say that had just been despatched .
neutral	customer_services worked after my intial query but they would do better to be more proactive in letting peoiple know the status of their order .
neutral	although the products are great and i constantly got messages updating me on the order i placed , i feel as though the delivery has let the whole_experience down somewhat .
neutral	order was placed on a monday_evening and i chose free delivery which was expected on the wednesday , that '_s great because that '_s when they were needed .
neutral	however i got an email delivery confit sol saying they were delivered after 0pm .
neutral	that '_s nearly the end of the day .
neutral	i would prefer to have elivery time slots available as an option as getting birthday gifts delivered near the end of the day is near pointless
neutral	i ordered £_000 worth of pc parts to build a pc from aria as i found their site yet again very easy to use as i have the last 0 or 0 times i have bought products from them .
neutral	i have never had an issue with the website , delivery of the items or the items that were delivered ( i . e .
neutral	no faults ).
neutral	unfortunately i was given a fan which had a fault with one of the wires into the connector .
neutral	i thought that i would call their customer service to thought things out , only to hear that you can '_t return items over the phone .
neutral	i thought this was rather peculiar and questioned further about the return of the item .
neutral	i was told i would have to pay for the item to be sent back unless i wanted to come into the store , but before 0pm .
neutral	i thought this was strange again and then discovered that they are allowed 00 days to check for a fault .
neutral	so having received every part for the pc within_00hours of ordering it from the website , i could then potentially be without the faulty part for 0_weeks allowing for delivery .
neutral	i informed aria about the problem through their website and explained i could not afford to send the item back and that coming into the store before 0pm would prove probably too difficult .
neutral	i was immediately sent a code to put on a package to return the item , to then find out that i still had to pay to send that package and i had just received the standard returns and delivery procedure offered by aria .
neutral	i personally believe this has_been a poor customer service and response to a customer who has spent in excess of £ 0000 at aria over the last 00 months all over a £ 0 000mm fan .
neutral	it '_s the first fault i have had with any part yet i believe aria have failed to deal with the problem in an adequate way .
neutral	my friend ordered a part off amazon , it was faulty , they sent him a fresh one out with the return instructions and paid postage included .
neutral	that is the kind of customer service which is acceptable .
neutral	it didn_'_t take 0_weeks until he had a working part , he didn_'_t have to call up to be told he had to return it online , he didn_'_t have to complain_about their service and he wasn_'_t ignored by their customer service team in addition to not having to pay any return costs despite aria informing_me they could refund any postage for it for up to £ 0 . 00 .
neutral	overall i believe amazon won with their customer service as well as providing by enlarge lower prices .
neutral	i wonder where i will be tempted to get my pc parts from in the future ...
neutral	the price can '_t be_beaten - using the 00 network for coverage .
neutral	the only_downside is customer sevice takes_ages to answer calls & the online billing system is awkward to access - sending you a time limited pin to access your account - secure but long_winded .
neutral	if all you want is cheap coverage - can '_t be_beaten £ 0 per_month for unlimited_texts & 000 minutes
neutral	the product looks ok ( can '_t really comment until delivered ), but the website was way too slow and i almost gave up on several_occasions .
neutral	it was taking over 0 minutes to load the next page throughout the ordering_process .
neutral	not good for an internet company !
neutral	if this is typical , you will be reducing your potential trade enormously !
neutral	..... and the apartment had not been cleaned .
neutral	this has happened two years running in two different apartmenrts in two different counties .
neutral	i hope standards are not dropping .
neutral	we have booked again this year in cornwall so fingers_crossed .
neutral	had to take my 0 piece suit to a local seamstress .
neutral	i wouldn_'_t have bought online if there were a local tailor .
neutral	she pinched in the jacket a bit and completed the edge stitching where it was missing .
neutral	i was too late to claim my compensation .
neutral	the shirt had sleeves 0 inches too long despite that i had corrected my mistaken measurement immediately after entering it .
neutral	i gave it to my more normal sized son .
neutral	having learnt from my mistakes i ordered two more jackets and another shirt .
neutral	all three are quite satisfactory , for the price .
neutral	i was amused to notice , in my emailed confirmation , that a suit was being made for a man 0 cm tall weighing 000 kilos !
neutral	the service was polite and quick .
neutral	and i ordered again , but much more carefully !
neutral	skin two shirt is fantastic .
neutral	honour leggings are way to big .
neutral	size_chart is very wrong .
neutral	cost to return too high so i am stuck .... not sure if i will order again because of this .
neutral	pick_up was good driver polite and was on time , the text and email confirmation was comforting as it was booked online .
neutral	it was the total_opposite with the pick_up , i was 00_minutes early and called the contact number and informed them and somehow he booked another cab ?
neutral	then i got a phone_call from the guy picking me up asking where i was and i explained , he then said he was in terminal 0 which was interesting as i was in terminal 0 .
neutral	the reason i orgainsed a taxi is that due to my flights i left from terminal 0 and came back to terminal 0 so clearly didn_'_t check the flight details that had been requested .
neutral	finally when asked i suggested the m0 was quickest due to roadworks on m0 , he ignored my suggestion and was surprised to find the roadworks which closed off our junction !
neutral	while i applaud saving fuel to do it to the detriment of seeing out of the window by refusing to demist the windows is a little unnerving
neutral	no problem with ace_fx god service but as they use royal_mail it was sheer luck i got my cash in time .
neutral	why ?
neutral	well royal_mail were delivering next door couldn_'_t get a response and asked me to take it in for my neighbour .
neutral	i mentioned oh i was expecting a package and he replied no nothing for my address .
neutral	when i said it was a guaranteed delivery by 0pm and signed for he then checked his_van and found it !!
neutral	!
neutral	will i use a postal service again probably not although the rates are much_better but that was too close to not getting my cash .
neutral	it '_s great but it takes_ages and the estimated payment date keeps moving further and further away , i '_ve had one claim denied unfairly and this has done my opinion for the company involved great damage !
neutral	we have used jessops several_times for their photo_albums and have been very happy with them , likewise calendars but very disappointed with the print colour on their mugs .
neutral	we would have returned them but unfortunately time would not permit .
neutral	was ok would go to store next time if in a rush as delivery was less convenient x
neutral	renewal was up approx 00 %.
neutral	had to ring for better quote .
neutral	told std price given wiithout discount .
neutral	same quote as last premium then given
neutral	bought an arte shower_rail kit , the chrome rail itself doesn_'_t match the chrome of the other parts and appears yellowish in colour .
neutral	the replacement was exactly the same .
neutral	customer service , however , was very good .
neutral	fast delivery , but envelope with bubbles and torn boxes , containing the cables did not appear damaged .
neutral	i have not been able to try the cables received because of the room currently being redeveloped .
neutral	have brought from amazon many_times and mostly i find good prices and delivery but have also had some issues in the past when the goods aren_'_t shipped by amazon themselves but via other_sellers .
neutral	i brought a digital_slr_camera earlier this year which i didn_'_t realise until afterwards was actually being sold by a company in germany via amazon .
neutral	the delivery due date came and went and when i contacted the seller they told me it had been lost in the post and that they would refund me !
neutral	to be fair they refunded me quickly and no_harm_done but my advice would be to check the good are actually being sold by amazon and not one of their partners .
neutral	also its a shame amazon don_'_t pay proper taxes in the uk - will think_twice before making large purchases there again .
neutral	fantastic ankle_brace but the mesh over the plastic_inserts is not very durable .
neutral	i wear one of these brace '_s most day '_s due to an unstable ankle .
neutral	the brace is lightweight and doe '_s a very good job with all_kinds of footwear .
neutral	this is the third a00 brace that i have bought but the grey mesh wear '_s out quite fast .
neutral	if the manufacturer made the material over the plastic_inserts from the same stuff as the rest of the brace it would last a lot longer .
neutral	£_00 every 00 / 00 months works out expensive .
neutral	i ordered two items .
neutral	000 phoned the next_day to say that the wc was out of stock , would be delivered in a few_days .
neutral	that '_s exactly_what happened .
neutral	unfortunately the shower was not included .
neutral	i phoned to find out where it was .
neutral	a charming_young_lady promised to find out and phone me , but didn_'_t .
neutral	i had to phone again , this time she did reply , the shower was not in stock .
neutral	would like to have known that at the start .
neutral	i needed to set_up the shower room , so asked her to email instructions .
neutral	yes she said , that will be fine .
neutral	no instructions , but finally , after three_weeks , the shower did arrive .
neutral	booking was easy but for second year running was left_stranded at airport because car didn_'_t turn_up . was eventually sorted but again holiday was not off to a good start
neutral	villa was very tired looking .
neutral	. bath towels needed binning i hsve better one for my dog .. sheets the same .. mattress need replacing springs coming through ... electric_kettle darn right dangerous leaked everywhere along with the fridge_freezer .. outside an accident wsiting to happen if it has not already the tiles are lethal .
neutral	.
neutral	james_villa '_s next year for me !
neutral	asked question vis web chat which wasn_'_t working so prompted for e_mail question . did not receive an answer - still purchased policy but unsure what cover my bikes have whilst i am cycle touring .
neutral	website was easy to use and the rates were very competitive relative to other online quotes i had seen .
neutral	really good apart_from leaving the old washing_machine and i thought it was going to be taken_away ????
neutral	?
neutral	there was a full 0inches difference in the width between my previous one ( xl ) and your recent delivery .
neutral	in addition to the difference in size , the quality of current one is appalng by comparison and i shall not be purchasing any further products from target_dry , you can be sure .
neutral	it was fortunate that i was able to pass the new one to someone_else .
neutral	i was told i had total insurance for car yet i was sold extra_insurance for tyre cover .
neutral	the only other annoying_thing is the way they con you with the fuel .
neutral	they make you pay € 00 up front for fuel , as the car is supplied with a full_tank , and tell you to return it empty .
neutral	now as fuerteventura is such a small island you would need to drive 000km per day to stand a chance of using it all !
neutral	the most fair way of doing this is to supply a full_tank , and you to return it full , thus only paying for the fuel you actually use , and not letting goldcar do the same to the next hirer .
neutral	i only used half a tank , so reckon they made around € 00 proffit from me alone .
neutral	i speak from experience , and not a good one !
neutral	they are good , but they don_'_t sell everything i need .
neutral	i buy lots of locks for upvc doors , but they only stock a few makes and every week i buy different locks made by different companies .
neutral	because of this i buy at places like duffells , northwest hardware and on ebay .
neutral	i used to use windowware to buy stock items like friction hinges and cylinders , but it '_s easier to use the companies i use weekly .
neutral	oh , and whilst the locks are cheap , by the time they charge you what they do for carriage , forget it !
neutral	all my other_suppliers come up with weekly emailed offers ( gearboxes / centre cases / multipoint locks / friction hinges etc_.)
neutral	and i nearly always go for these offers .
neutral	only last_week i bought a load of lockmaster centre cases for £_00 each , delivered free .
neutral	.
neutral	!!!.
neutral	.
neutral	.
neutral	sorry folks , but you did ask !
neutral	!
neutral	items were sent out and received them promptly within a couple of days .
neutral	however , as the items were not suitable i returned but have had no confirmation of receipt by ja despite chasing .
neutral	seem quick to sell but not so quick to sort refund , which is disappointing .
neutral	i can '_t complain_about the general service and responsiveness of wiggle , but the product i ordered was out of stock when i placed my order .
neutral	this was fine as it was for an unusual size and wiggle seemed to be one of the few shops that could at_least get hold of it for me .
neutral	my gripe came when enquiring when this would be back in stock or ordered from the supplier - they seem to have little or no inventory_management , or at_least the customer_support_team aren_'_t communicated this information by the purchasing department , so it left me completely in the dark as to when i would get my order .
neutral	as i said , i was willing to wait due to it being an odd size , but i would expect to be given at_least some timeframe as to when this would be processed .
neutral	as it was i waited but in another instance i would just as quickly cancelled and looked elsewhere .
neutral	excellent comparison website for ferries .
neutral	used it for france and i can '_t fault the layout or content .
neutral	two things could be improved :
neutral	0 .
neutral	prices go up considerably very quickly , making me suspicious that they don_'_t monitor enquiries for demand rather_than purchases
neutral	0 .
neutral	the site kept_crashing when i tried to book and pay , and i had to restart it all many_times which was extremely frustrating .
neutral	i have had big problems with wren also , they were aware that my wife had just recovered from cancer and i was recovering from a heart_attack but it made no difference they still treated us appallingly .
neutral	people like these should not be in business .
neutral	bought a ex_display from howden branch , was sent with parts missing ie sink taps , was repeatedly given the run around .
neutral	eventually they sent the wrong taps which were way too big for the small sink .
neutral	it then got worse was lied to repeatedly told they would send the right ones but never did . then i ordered two brackets that were missing from hull branch . was told they cost £_00 when i objected they said you can have them for £ 0 .
neutral	the actual cost of these id about £ 0 . 00 .
neutral	after over two week i phoned hull and asked where they were and was told oh sorry they have not been dispatched for some unknown_reason .
neutral	try any where but here they are a nightmare to deal with .
neutral	the parts turned_up eventually , unfortunately they are the wrong parts .
neutral	so the saga_continues .
neutral	phoned hull yesterday , spoke to a very nice man called michael .
neutral	he sorted everything out in less_than an_hour .
neutral	all the problems are now sorted .
neutral	also had a phone_call from the area manager danny rose who_apologised for the bad_experience and said he would be investigating why this happened .
neutral	he also is sending me a cheque for a night out for me and my wife .
neutral	hopefully this was a one off .
neutral	my flowers arrived with no ballon and only 00 roses so i never got my money worth apart_from that my girlfriend liked them and very good delivery
neutral	we booked well in advance to select a villa rather_than a specific country or region that would meet our diverse extended family needs and were disappointed that this villa and our second choice were both withdrawn over the following months having booked and paid a sizable deposit .
neutral	villa_plus staff helped_us select an_alternative villa on both_occasions and offered some compensation which we accepted .
neutral	that said bob parish at villa_plus was very helpful and overall the villa atalaya was more than adequate .
neutral	the pool and garden were good and safe for the kids with supervision .
neutral	the local rep and local staff were good too ( gardener , pool cleaner and villa cleaner ).
neutral	the jet 0 flights were very good and there was plenty to do and see in the surrounding_area but a car is essential for getting around .
neutral	the local beach was disappointing .
neutral	there are some shops : butcher , baker and supermarket within walking_distance as well as a couple of bars and restaurants .
neutral	it all worked out in the end and the family holiday was judged a success by all .
neutral	on the 00th_april_0000 received one floor_standing minimalist compact unit inc basin gloss_white , code nvx000 , when opened the unit was damaged in a number of places .
neutral	have been promised a replacement this week which will restore my faith in your company and would give you ten out ten as was very pleased with the goods and price . waiting in anticipation
neutral	found the prices good value but am still_awaiting delivery .
neutral	i get books from amazon within three_days but up to now i have been waiting 00 working_days and at the moment nothing .
neutral	feel the system is let_down by bad deliveroies , sad .
neutral	tried to send you message but your site was down .
neutral	sent direct telling them of their mistake , my order was dispatched on 00 november so not 0 days into delivery but 00 .
neutral	so as i said delivery lousy !
neutral	!
neutral	the product is ok i think the prob is my denture , it is made mostly of metal , so does the glue not suit metal or is there one that does
neutral	i '_ve been a customer for over five years .
neutral	the prices are competitive , the web service is ok , the email service has_improved to ok , but every now and then you get outages for up to several hours when you can '_t get to you email .
neutral	i agree with another_reviewer , watch for the auto - renewal , they love to capture your card_details and generate those invoices .
neutral	but also note that all prices are displayed excluding_vat , which only appears on your emailled invoice .
neutral	hi ,
neutral	at the end of the day that my delivery was expected , i still hadn_'_t received my package but it had already been signed for .
neutral	i ' d been out briefly but expected a note saying a delivery had been attempted while i was out .
neutral	i called fedex who told me that the package had been delivered to a neighbour ( on the wrong street ).
neutral	this was a bit_annoying as your delivery policy states it won_'_t be delivered to another house or signed for by anyone apart_from at the final address .
neutral	it also says that if nobody is in , a delivery note will be left and then reattempted .
neutral	both of which were broken by fedex .
neutral	it then put me in an awkward_position having to go to a random person '_s house ( repeatedly as they weren_'_t in ).
neutral	then found out fedex had delivered it to the wrong street .
neutral	thanks ,
neutral	tristan
neutral	i did try and check but was told there was only one part no so it was not possible .
neutral	cooker knobs in green , got one smaller than the rest but can '_t be_bothered to send it back .
neutral	decent enough company in general , although staff are poorly advised and are not the best for advice .
neutral	they are usually more_expensive than most too .
neutral	service excellent , but flowers disappointing
neutral	we booked the full day tour .
neutral	the bus was overbooked and we had to wait an_hour before they could get another one .
neutral	the full day tour was far too long but that was our choice .
neutral	needed a tour between half day and full day but as we couldn_'_t get away on time we were glad we weren_'_t on half day tour .
neutral	we arrived back early ie a good half hour beforehand , to catch the bus back and they were about to leave with or without us .
neutral	on the whole we thought the service provided was for their benefit rather_than the customer .
neutral	when i first contacted you , i was told that i had to ask a medical professional as to whether my condition could have been as a direct result of my work .
neutral	giving me the impression that if they said my condition was work related , i would be able to claim .
neutral	after_speaking with a specialist consultant , he said it was possible my condition was work related but he was non committal in that he would not put his_name to any document saying that .
neutral	regardless , i was asked lots more questions ( information already provided ) and put through to a solicitor .
neutral	straight_away the solicitor established that the actions i were carrying out when my injury occurred were not out of the " norm " and the employer was not negligent , no case to answer .
neutral	may i suggest when training staff in future and also inform current staff , they should establish from the initial conversation , that if the incident occurs during normal activities , with no blame being apportioned to the employer , there is no case .
neutral	i think this approach would be beneficial to both_parties , as you would save_money on phone_calls ( i was called at_least six times ) and the potential claimant won_'_t be given false hope
neutral	i made an error when ordering two lots of bsthroom rugs . i thought i was getting the complete sets ( bath_mat and pedestal )
neutral	when i rang up to speak to someone to get the remainder of the sets sent to me , i was disappointed to find i could not have the discounted set price now and would have to buy the pedestal mats separately !
neutral	or go to all the trouble of sending it all back and starting again .
neutral	such s shame as the rugs are lovely and arrived quickly .
neutral	groupon do a lot of good deals , offering nice savings on items and days out etc .
neutral	but a lot of their deals ( on physical items especially ) are just over - hyped .
neutral	they say you ' re saving 00_% but in fact if you shop around a bit the saving is more like 00_% or even 0 .
neutral	for example , i bought a hoody for £_00 instead of £_000 .
neutral	so a big saving right ?
neutral	well it turns_out the deal was by a rip - off company who sells at stupid prices .
neutral	i wasnt actually saving any money since i could '_ve got the hoody at the same price from the manufacturer online .
neutral	the occasional gem does pop up so i always visit every day .
neutral	£_00 for a round of golf for two was the best deal ive_seen .
neutral	we bought 0 of those vouchers and saved a good £_00 during the summer golfing season !
neutral	game . co . uk is just ok .
neutral	speedy free delivery on their many products .
neutral	they offer reward_points on purchases which are nice .
neutral	the company also tends to have exclusive offers such as the special ' epic ' edition of gears of war 0 .
neutral	their negatives are :
neutral	0 ) their lack of customer service ( in my case anyway ).
neutral	i messaged them twice about minor things and they didnt respond .
neutral	this is rather worrying - what if i ever have a real problem ?
neutral	0 ) their prices are normally quite uncompetitive .
neutral	you just can '_t charge £_00 for a game that has_been out for over a year !
neutral	0 ) many items such as older games and action figures are out of stock all the time .
neutral	great blinds but no instructions on how to install !
neutral	although a good quality product for a competitive price the order process was misleading and i was expecting rsvp envelopes with my home address but they didn_'_t arrive .
neutral	could certainly be better .
neutral	after travelling a short_distance the oil warning_light came on .
neutral	i pulled into a service station to check the oil which was low and very dirty so i paid for and put in 0litr of new oil which cost about 00euros .
neutral	i assumed that i would be refunded for this expediture but the staff were unwilling to pay me .
neutral	they have referred the matter to head_office .
neutral	i '_m not holding my breath !
neutral	i ordered 00 thank_you cards , printed on premium paper .
neutral	the total_cost was £_00 inc pp .
neutral	the end product was poor quality , badly printed and not at all what i expected for what i paid .
neutral	i was duly refunded my monies .
neutral	i placed the same order on snapfish , 00 cards , for half the price , and was completely_satisfied with the quality of the end product .
neutral	optimal must review their product offering .
neutral	great product .
neutral	could come with fitting_instructions .
neutral	i '_ve just registered for a loyalty_card membership .
neutral	that process was easy , but actually then booking a hotel and viewing available rates was fiddly ...
neutral	i found things very easy to buy a specific product .
neutral	when i tried then to browse the categories more generally , i found it tricky to effectively move around the site .
neutral	additionally , when i tried to sign - up for the 0000 catalogue ( following an email invitation email also received today ) this was very cumbersome .
neutral	the furniture is great .
neutral	we decided against having a coffee_table and were assured that it was no problem .
neutral	that is really a joke .
neutral	first we were told it was cancelled and we would be contacted .
neutral	then several days_later we rang again only to be told it wasn_'_t cancelled and that we would have to go into store to resign for the goods .
neutral	then we were told we would get an email to sign .
neutral	this never arrived .
neutral	finically we went back into store and had to rearrange delivery .
neutral	three_weeks late we no have everything and it looks great .
neutral	will think_twice before_committing to you again unfortunately
neutral	we bought two vouchers and used one .
neutral	due to a change of circumstance we asked for a £_00 refund on the second identical voucher .
neutral	we were emailed saying wowcher were under no obligation to offer a refund as 00 days had passed .
neutral	fair_enough but we told wowcher we were merely asking for a gesture of goodwill to keep our faith in wowcher ie to keep us as future customers .
neutral	at this stage we are now being ignored therefore for the sake of a refund of only £_00 wowcher have lost who_knows_how much future custom from us .
neutral	there are no doubt good reliable deals via wowcher but they have lost credibility with us and shant use them again .
neutral	printer was ordered at 00 : 00 on wednesday_morning , showed in stock and the money was taken straight_away so i hoped to get the stated " usually shipped same day if ordered before 00 : 00 " deal .
neutral	very disappointing that the shipment was not made until the following_monday_afternoon .
neutral	thankfully parcel_force did their bit and got it delivered next_day .
neutral	not my best experience and will not be top of my list next time .
neutral	not up to much to be honest .
neutral	grammatical errors with regards one of the logos , slow service .
neutral	i was told things would take 0 - 00 days and so called about every 0th day or so to see how things were progressing ; only to be told on each_occassion that firstly id be able to come in and collect after 0 days and then that on the morning of the 00th day that they hadnt been made yet .
neutral	later that day i got to speak to someone_who got things moving .
neutral	and received everything the following_day .
neutral	strange .
neutral	i ordered a single red_rose in a box for my wife for our_wedding_anniversary - to be delivered to the hotel we were staying at .
neutral	although the rose arrived on time , the box was covered in dust and the flower wasn_'_t fastened in correctly , leading me to think that the florist had had the box on a shelf for quite a while and didn_'_t know how to put the flower in it !
neutral	a quick check over and a wipe with a duster would definitely have helped with the overall appearance and my satisfaction !
neutral	delivery was on time , disappointed with the quality of the goods .
neutral	nothing like the portfolio photographs online .
neutral	will probably shop with partyrama again , but not for props
neutral	good customer service , and easy to use .
neutral	slightly_disappointed in the actual size of bouquet as it seemed much fuller on advert photo .
neutral	delivery was very quick , although the driver did have to phone my partner to find her address , which spoilt the surprise somewhat - he could have phoned me or just checked google_maps etc ...
neutral	also , the flowers looked fairly tired , which is a shame because at £_00 i ' d have expected better frankly .
neutral	this is the second time i '_ve been disappointed with seranta ; i won_'_t be using them again .
neutral	fussy , cluttered website .
neutral	hard to input details .
neutral	quicker to phone the branch to book .
neutral	ordering_process simple and easy - but i '_m still_waiting for delivery .
neutral	when order is complete i might consider uprating .
neutral	i am very satisfied with the mattress .
neutral	it '_s superb , was excellent value and was delivered quickly .
neutral	i was fed_up that despite talking to rachel at bedworld and also to the delivery agents i was still unable to arrange a time_slot for the delivery .
neutral	the most ludicrous advice i got was that it could arrive any time after 0am and if i wanted to track the delivery i could ring after 0am .
neutral	i personally find the site a nightmare to navigate .
neutral	the search_feature is next to useless .
neutral	it '_s easier to use the ' site :' operator on google (" keyword " site : amazon . co . uk )
neutral	the recent ( not that recent ) feature update that allows anyone to sell on amazon also unnerves me a little_bit .
neutral	i use amazon because it is a big company that i can trust and is generally cheap , but i find it miss - leading when amazon is ' displaying ' a product that they do not sell .
neutral	they only get 0_stars because when i do order , it '_s fairly cheap , items usually get dispatched before the expected date , and the free super_saver delivery is actually pretty quick !
neutral	i thought there were too many terms & conditions in small_print .
neutral	the initial_quote then appeared to be misleading .
neutral	you state on your web_site that there is " free delivery next_day in the u . k " i was asked to pay an extra £_00 to have the goods delivered to belfast .
neutral	am i entitled to a refund as you have clearly breached your own stated policy ?
neutral	great prices but the free delivery was painfully_slow .
neutral	i '_ll be paying the extra in the future for a quicker delivery service .
neutral	ordered a boquet specifically because it contained chrysanths and roses , but it contained mostly lilies , which are disliked by the recipient , who of course was politely grateful .
neutral	delivery was great and on time by a good guy .
neutral	i have no problem with the arranged booking .
neutral	however we had our car broken into resulting in a side window being broken and damage to the windscreen .
neutral	changing the car was not a problem other than we lost half a day taking the car back to cape_town airport .
neutral	but although we had paid for the full insurance coverage there was an additional 000 rand ' assessment fee ' payable which was pointed_out to me in the small_print when i questioned the charge .
neutral	i think the company should clearly point this out up front rather_than have it in the small_print .
neutral	then it would not be a surprise .
neutral	i thought that paying extra for full , no deductible insurance_cover should have covered this event which was not our fault as the vehicle was parked in the drive way of our b_& b
neutral	generally it went well until delivery then we had a challenge - one decking piece for the workbench top / shelf was ' cracked ' and had to be replaced .
neutral	the first lot of replacement parts bore no relationship to that bit required despite the order being correct .
neutral	thanks for the free wall unit .
neutral	very useful .
neutral	it did happen at the second time of asking and all done in a very helpful way .
neutral	now all is well and i am pleased with the result .
neutral	thanks again for the free wall unit - this too will be useful .
neutral	nice villa as per description
neutral	however should have been told that it was on a noisy street ( cars and bikes ), opposite a school and a playing field with constant noise during day and into late evening
neutral	this is an excellent store where you can find every product on the market , but the shipping is expensive .
neutral	there is another company where i buy my supplements where they charge you $ 0 dollars flat_rate shipping no matter_how many products you purchase .
neutral	i only come here once a year for my free magazine_subscription .
neutral	if supplementwarehouse lowers its shipping rates , i would buy everything here .
neutral	:)
neutral	the materials first_class , instructions very bad , the measurements are wrong on the batons spacing which caused a major problem
neutral	disappointed with the site posted dates got the price up then tried to book it , on several_times to no_avail could not get through . but kept on trying finally got through on about the 0th try
neutral	i received an email to inform_me that i would receive my parcel on 00st_may .
neutral	as i was working night duties at the time i rearranged delivery for 0rd_june .
neutral	i received a confirmation_email which stated that my parcel would be delivered on 0rd_june and that i would receive a further email on the day of delivery telling_me my 0 hour time_slot .
neutral	i received no such email so went to track my parcel online , only to find that for some unknown_reason my parcel has_been sent from southampton to birmingham and is still sitting in a hub !
neutral	i live in surrey and cannot understand_why my parcel would be sent to birmingham .
neutral	after eventually locating a telephone_number for dpd customer_services i was told that my parcel would be delivered tomorrow but not to worry as this would be free of charge !!!
neutral	all in all a complete_shambles and i will avoid companies who use this service in the future .
neutral	update_:
neutral	after being told this morning at 00 : 00 that my parcel will be delivered early tomorrow morning i see that at 00 : 00 it is still sat in the birmingham hub !!!
neutral	i am not filled with confidence .
neutral	update 0 : 00 / 00 / 00
neutral	well i have to say dpd were as good as their word to me yesterday .
neutral	i received an email this morning telling_me my parcel would be delivered between 00 : 00 - 00 : 00 and at 00 : 00 it arrived .
neutral	so despite the original mishap dpd resolved the matter asap and so i have added a star to my rating .
neutral	tracking_info would be so much_better as am a very busy person and dont have time to sit about waiting for a random knock on the door with my parcel .
neutral	other than that the items are cheap and great thanks
neutral	good easy process on the website . however national are advising ( after ) the purchase that additional_costs due to possible removal of under covers that there may be an additional_charge . this is a scam and should be priced in to the job . no other garage does this or indeed highstreet tyre and exhaust companys like kwikfit etc_etc .
neutral	product arrived promptly .
neutral	all ok except lid of product broken into lots of pieces and therefore unable to reseal the gel dispenser rendering product unusable
neutral	a good company to deal with but were out of stock on at_least one item , although i '_m_sure the system showed as in stock when order was placed .
neutral	this caused my order to take 0_weeks to reach me .
neutral	no problem caused but would have been better had i been informed rather_than me having to chase a couple of times .
neutral	as i previous said no real problem and would purchase from them again .
neutral	batteries are delicate but heavy and liable to damage if not package well .
neutral	the lead - acid sealed 00v 0 . 0 a / h battery that i ordered arrived in a thin " jiffy " type bag which had only a thin layer of bubble_wrap and one terminal of the battery was bent .
neutral	i would purchase more batteries if i could be assured of better packaging .
neutral	i purchased 0 x fans .
neutral	one was fine , but for the second fan , the box was torn and fell_apart when i lifted the fan out of the box .
neutral	we have used alpha_rooms for years and always an exellent service all the way , the people they used in turkey this year not good the atitude of the english female rep at dalaman_airport was at best terrible the bus went without us and all the rep said was you only paid peanuts so i dont_know whay your problem is if you have to wait in heat with no shelter or water for a couple of hrs tough we are quite capable people but what if that was someone old / infirm or with disabled children not what i expect from alpharooms
neutral	went online to book an mot and other stuff .
neutral	put in all my details , booked my preferred slot .
neutral	all went_smoothly .
neutral	got rung the next_day by a bloke telling_me that my slot was no_longer available .
neutral	didn ; t have diary with me so ended_up going into the local_branch anyway to arrange the mot .
neutral	so much for making it easier and cheaper by going online .
neutral	i think you should only have to pay the amount of fuel used we returned the car with more than a quarter of a tank also charged vat on the fuel and hire of a child '_s car_seat i thought vat was already on fuel when you pay at the pumps 000_euros on top rental of car a bit_steep for a week
neutral	have bought different_types of glasses .
neutral	rimless turned_out to be weak and easily broken .
neutral	rimmed frames were perfect and i am very pleased with them .
neutral	price including extras , such as reactive lens , was very affordable .
neutral	i would recommend but get advice about the best lens to use in rimless designs .
neutral	the flowers arrived on time , but before i even had time to say thank_you and check the product the delivery man was back in the van and off down the street .
neutral	i had requested a ' happy birthday_balloon ' along with a card and the arizona flowers selection which were very good .
neutral	unfortunately the balloon didn_'_t arrive with the box .
neutral	very happy to remain buying products from serenta_flowers .
neutral	however on this occasion i have forgiven the lapse in communication and forgetton item due to the quality of flowers .
neutral	a quick quality check and service improvement next time please .
neutral	fitter arrived on time , did the job quite quickly .
neutral	too quickly in fact .
neutral	i suspected something wasn_'_t quite right straight_away when i looked at the wheels but by this point the fitter had left .
neutral	i couldn_'_t believe it ... he hadn_'_t balanced my tyres and he didn_'_t say anything about it before leaving .
neutral	this has tarnished my previous good experiences with event and i don_'_t think i '_ll be a repeat_customer due to this .
neutral	i placed an order on the 00th of december and was promised delivery on the 0rd of january , on the 0nd of january i received an_automated email_saying my delivery date had been changed which annoyed me but i thought because of the busy_christmas_period etc this could not be helped so let it go .
neutral	then on the 0th of january i received another automated email_saying they could not deliver again , i thought this was very poor and didn_'_t even tell me when my order would be delivered !
neutral	so i emailed customer service and to be fair the guy_who dealt_with my complaint was very professional and explained why my items had been delayed and offered to split my order so i could receive part of my order .
neutral	what annoyed me the most was advertising items on their website which can be delivered by a certain date but cannot follow this through because the item are not in stock ??
neutral	anyways i '_ve been promised these items tomorrow but we shall see , i doubt ill use g0m again .
neutral	... if it were not for their payment_method being by cheque , the process is faultless but take a very long time from acceptance of goods through to authorisation of cheque to posting of the cheque and then the delay while cheque goes through the bank .
neutral	given ziffit and music_magpie can pay via_bacs i see this as a weekness in the zapper propostition
neutral	now on second shipment where items i know were shipped are marked as not received , raise it with customer_services and the response is ' well the item ( s ) was not there '
neutral	there was a time ( 0 years or more ago ) when play . com was often my first_port of call for shopping .
neutral	sadly that is no_longer the case , as although often competitive on price , i have experienced order issues with them more recently , leading me to discount them as a trusted internet retailer ....
neutral	quick delivery , no issues with order , and cheapest for the muck_boots we wanted .
neutral	but returns cost me £ 0 to ship back item + £ 0 . 00 deducted from refund to cover their shipping charges .
neutral	with this in mind i ' d say make_sure you know what you want before you buy it .
neutral	the price quoted on the prices screen does not include a payment fee of £ 0 . 00 .
neutral	this - and two optional charges - are not shown until the payment page .
neutral	prices competitive and booking process otherwise ok so no reason not to use .
neutral	website slow and not easy to navigate .
neutral	valid on - line discount_code ( found in several places ) did not work .
neutral	no vat - free facility when buying item for eligible user .
neutral	all these issues raised with customer_services immediately after_placing order ; no response on first two points and bluntly told that there was no facility for vat - free sales ( unlike almost every other supplier of items for the disabled etc ).
neutral	the two items ordered were both in stock but were not despatched for about a week .
neutral	not impressed with overall service ; doubtful that i will make any future_purchases .
neutral	needs to be a better / fairer middle_man .
neutral	fees way too high .
neutral	paypal takes a lot too .
neutral	need a competitor badly .
neutral	will not let you withdraw decimals !
neutral	so winnings were £_000 . 00 .
neutral	wouldn_'_t let_me withdraw the 00p .
neutral	fix that , and they would be decent .
neutral	had good and bad_experiences with the company .
neutral	when it works , great .
neutral	( slow delivery though )
neutral	main problem is that , twice , i have been sent the wrong product .
neutral	first time , i was sent a fake ' replica ' item .
neutral	did get a refund .
neutral	second item i received a wrong product , it was a bigger version of the one requested .
neutral	customer service is great .
neutral	however , they have to contact the supplier , so it all takes a lot of time to go through the stages .
neutral	most of the time , saving a few_pounds from amazon isn_'_t worth it .
neutral	great site , well made .
neutral	however , companies can claim_against all reviews that don_'_t put an order number !
neutral	seems bonkers as most won_'_t take the time to come_back to update proof !
neutral	definitely not somewhere i shop often , however was surprised to see how many people actually in the store !
neutral	very busy despite the poor prices on most items .
neutral	i was expected a better taste of the meat and less fat .
neutral	expect to spend_ages trying to park your car if you pre_- book into an airport - located car_park - use the park and ride facilities instead : it will save you time and stress !
neutral	i '_m very pleased with the laptop i bought from cleverboxes via ebay .
neutral	it was exactly as_described and delivered very quickly and efficiently .
neutral	however , i want to extend the warranty from 0 year to 0 years but despite_numerous email_exchanges and a phone_call i have still not managed to get a price from cleverboxes .
neutral	i '_ve had two emails_telling_me that there is more than one option for extending the warranty but after over two_weeks of trying i '_ve still not received anything .
neutral	only_criticism of heinnie i wish they would always send my item royal_mail instead of ups , reason being is i can always pick my item up from the delivery yard if i '_m not in , with ups i need to rearrange a delivery , but if they really want the best delivery book dpd as they give you a 0 hour delivery window and e_- mail conformation .
neutral	we thought that we were mislead on the price they quoted 00 pounds for 00 days rental which was quite unbelievable at the time but had another 000_pounds to pay on arrival find out overall cost to avoid shock they are not cheap
neutral	service and site very good and easy to use !!
neutral	however the next_day delivery service wasn_'_t as good as i ' d_hoped , ordered on a monday_night and parcel arrived on the thursday !
neutral	!
neutral	product ordered and not received when queried stated they had not received prescription which they then had , product then delivered quickly so received in the nick of time !
neutral	myprotein is a company that made a niche in the market by giving discounts on buying in bulk .
neutral	trouble is theres only a few products they do sell in bulk .
neutral	myprotein sold stuff with nothing added or taken_away but its not so now .
neutral	stuff like the beef liver tablets with added b00 so customers can ' feel ' the effects is misleading its not something they would have done a couple years_ago .
neutral	still keep_coming_back and is alot_cheaper_than some of the other_sites and dont_bother buying in retail_stores .
neutral	the outfits look nice online but it hasnt came yet despite paying extra for quick delivery , currently a day over the ' latest ' delivery date
neutral	let_down as the edges of the petals were a bit dry and not completely fresh
neutral	nice size .
neutral	i bought my wife some flowers for a special day of ours , same day delivery splashed all over the blurb , i didn_'_t go for the more_expensive ones i wanted which looked amazing as they said next_day , but they weren_'_t delivered the same day she got them 00_hours after i wanted her to have them .
neutral	she of course is delighted with then , but should i have just taken the next_day ones or should i demand a refund ?
neutral	not sure what do you think ?
neutral	very dissapointed with the condition of this villa , pool dirty , pool cover had hole '_s all the way through it , only place that was fit for was the bin .
neutral	patio furniture very dirty and dated , sun_lounger , s the same .
neutral	cleaning stuff left at front_door not really acceptable or professional .
neutral	bought the cash counter but its great for coins but seems to struggle with notes .
neutral	its easy enough to use and there is a calibration to run through which might help when i get chance to sort it !
neutral	the item was described as a helikon ecwcs gen 0 jacket , so i purchased it as needed a waterproof for the weekend , the jacket arrived within a couple of days which was a top service , but the jacket i recieved was a helikon - tex jacket ( not the same as_described ).
neutral	delivery was fine , but no one recognize there some items was not in stock .
neutral	from my experiences in other company i have money back for those item and they charge me when item was in stock again .
neutral	and unfortunately when i ask for online advisory i just receive tel_number to call and ask manufacturer .
neutral	poor service in my opinion .
neutral	all in all rentalcars . com is a service i ' d use again .
neutral	their price was much_better_than companies quoted me directly .
neutral	the only problem i encountered was that i booked the car 0 , 0 days before i needed it and after that i received a confirmation stating i would receive the rental voucher within 00_hours .
neutral	that gave some stress , as i wouldn_'_t have internet and needed the voucher sooner .
neutral	i emailed customer service but they took some time getting back to me .
neutral	in the end it was a helpful chap on the uk phone - number ( international and south_african freephone didn_'_t work ) who helped_me out and got my voucher to me within an_hour of our conversation .
neutral	unfortunately the phone - call cost me about half a days rental equivalent in cash ..
neutral	definately 0 or more stars if you guys handle short_notice bookings more expeditiosly ( or at_least warn of the 00 hour period before booking ..).
neutral	that said , good customer_support with 00 hour phone numbers when something_goes_wrong .
neutral	contacted tyre_shopper by phone to ask them to price match a tyre that i had found cheaper by another on - line supplier and fitter , rather_than asking the details of the supplier and looking it up i had to send a link .
neutral	after the email with the link failed to reach them for some reason ( which may have been mine ) i had to verbally supply the details , which i could have done in the first place .
neutral	i then received an email with a link to buy the tyres at the competitor '_s price and booked for them to be fitted .
neutral	the tyres had not arrived in time for them to be fitted at the allocated time and i was told by the fitting_centre that as soon as they arrived they would phone me .
neutral	when i had not heard_anything i phoned the centre to be told that they were there , i went and had them fitted which didn_'_t take long .
neutral	the whole_process was somewhat laboured but at_least i saved about £_00 .
neutral	i needed a new charger for my aeg vacuum_cleaner , wow what a maze i had to navigate to find it ; however all '_s well that ends well and i eventually found it tucked_away in the depths of the software suite .
neutral	maybe a wee look at the i . t .
neutral	may be in order .
neutral	never mind , i can now charge the battery in my cleaner .
neutral	well firstly , this was meant to be a supprise , but the delivery failed as no access to the building , i questioned this , as the building is fully staffed from 0am - 0 :_00pm and had a reception with directions to deliver , i was told that the package was mis_- scanned and the driver came back and delivered the parcel within an_hour of my complaint .
neutral	serenataflowers did a great job , flower are lovely and the girl i sent them too really really loves them , however her special supprise was ruined when i was forced to phone her before they eventually arrived to be on the lookout for a package .
neutral	not happy with the delivery company .
neutral	having waited in all day , my delivery never arrived .
neutral	at about lunchtime i got a text with a 0pm till_0pm slot .
neutral	it never happened .
neutral	my jacket turned_up the next_day .
neutral	if you need a company that can deliver on time , i ' d suggest you go_elsewhere .
neutral	very disappointing to find that travelex are no_longer at london_gatwick and therefore will i ever use them again ?
neutral	i did purchase money from travelex this time but as it was short_notice and too late to know no_longer at lgw .
neutral	i therefore collected my money from t0 at heathrow .
neutral	i did use buy back but with parking cost of £ 0 . 00 was it worth the purchase ?
neutral	i understand that tesco '_s money currency is managed bu travelex .
neutral	if that is the case can one not use them to collect from ?
neutral	the birthday flowers arrived at our hotel after we had gone out to dinner
neutral	good site , good price , prompt service , but let_down by the fact that 0 out of the 0 boxes i received had 0 stripes of what seems to be grout across every tile .
neutral	this caused me extra work as i had to scrape every tile before putting on wall .
neutral	was not advised that the tiles would be in this condition .
neutral	the bouquet was smaller than_expected and much small than others that i '_ve had delivered for the same price .
neutral	disappointed .
neutral	i purchased the acme dynarock barrel scanner over the phone , the gentleman dealing
neutral	with the order was very pleasant and said the light was good and a good seller .
neutral	as i was unsure of the capabilities of the light his advice was reassuring , but when it arrived i was unsure how to programme it , so i rang back and asked for help and was told to read the manual , which took me aback as i thought i would be advised as i had been the first time , so this marred my experience with why buy new
neutral	we rented a nice new ford_fiesta diesel on the internet for a price of 000 danish kroner for a week .
neutral	we prepaid the car and thought everything was fine .
neutral	but when we came to alicante to pickup the car , we were presented for another payment on 0 . 000 danish kroner ....
neutral	so now the price was not 000 , but almost 0000 danish kroners .
neutral	we were told that the difference was because of late flight , diesel on the car and insurance !
neutral	the late flight time was already_mentioned in the order and therefore included in the price .
neutral	diesel could not be that big amount , because i filled it up later and the amount for a full_tank was 00 €.
neutral	we have a experience that everything is superb until it comes to the price .......
neutral	the company should tell the right price from the beginning when we book .
neutral	scan are a very good component supplier and at a very good price .
neutral	only down_side is in order to make the most out of their service you need to know what you want ( its not like going to pc_world etc ).
neutral	this is not a problem but i have seen so many people looking forlorn as they are not sure what an atx form is or what power_supply they need or whether they want agp or pcie .
neutral	scan would get a better score if they helped the less technological minded customers out there .
neutral	after_hearing such positive_reviews about this company i decided to proceed with my order of selling my ipod_nano .
neutral	initial estimate of £_00 seemed very good indeed compared to other 0rd_party companies , however i then received an email to say that it had ' less_than 0 scratches on the front ' and decreased the value to £_00 . 00 , although still a fair price i accepted , but i know for a sure that the equipment was in pristine_condition when it left , so i would like to know where the ' scratches ' appeared from .
neutral	would i recommend them ... most_likely as it was a smooth_transaction .
neutral	come on trustpilot ,
neutral	here i am logged in , and writing a comment , but unable to post it unless i have a facebook account .
neutral	i don_'_t and never will have a facebook account .
neutral	don_'_t force people away because of this .
neutral	if your logged in you should be able to comment .
neutral	delivery was in time and i am happy with the price , however the balloon came completely deflated .
neutral	unfortunately i couldn_'_t send a picture to complain as my girlfriend doesn_'_t have a digital_camera or smart phone .
neutral	my consignment came quite fast which was goog but disappointed with the discount cards they were absolutely_useless because there was no code on them ?
neutral	i surpose the thought was there
neutral	the delivery time was longer_than the stated 0 - 0 working_days > i contacted 000golf by telephone on the 00th day , the phone was picked_up and hung_up straight_away on 0 occaissions .
neutral	when the phone was eventually answered the rep stated that a shipment had ' just arrived from america ' and my item would be shipped that day .
neutral	on the website it states that if any item was not in stock then the customer would be emailed to let them know .
neutral	this may seem a trivial matter but this item was a gift for someones birthday and i didn_'_t get it in time .
neutral	you get good value for money but at times orders are far too late arriving consequently i run out of tablets way before the next batch arrive .
neutral	my last order was on the 0 / 0 / 00 and still nothing !
neutral	i have to admit , when i looked at the amigo set_up , i was a little_sceptical - it '_s a new concept , and i initially thought that it would be hard to find a guarantor .
neutral	but after sending all the information on how it would work , out to mine , it was plain_sailing .
neutral	i think the important_thing for guarantor '_s is that the loans are not guaranteed on the property , and there '_s no credit_file footprint for them .
neutral	the customer service is great when you speak to amigo - but it does take_forever to get through to them , and i had to chase a couple of different_departments to move the process along .
neutral	i waited on hold for an_eternity and this is somthing that really needs to improve .
neutral	my guarantor was less_than impressed that he had to call in himself and wait for ages , i think really amigo should have called him .
neutral	however that aside the money was promptly paid , and the process is quite smooth .
neutral	on the whole a positive and helpfull service .
neutral	not brilliant to be honest , not sure will use web - site again
neutral	nice pizza , too expensive
neutral	tool frog delivered damaged / faulty but not a massive problem emailed my query and got nothing but help and information on returns_policy and that delivery cost met by buybrandtools
neutral	firstly , the web_pages showed product as " in stock ", when it was not , which i find unacceptable .
neutral	i chose proviation precisely because the product was shown as in stock .
neutral	ordered ( garmin glo gps receiver , £_00 ), then 0 days_later received email to say not in stock , and then another email to say further delay getting stock .
neutral	all this time the website continues to show product as " in stock ".
neutral	made several phone_calls to complain_about stock misleading , and to discuss either a discount , or order cancellation .
neutral	was several_times promised a call back , as the phone person could not make that decision , but was never called back .
neutral	several emails were not replied to .
neutral	in the end , i gave up , and phoned again , and cancelled order , and then ordered elsewhere .
neutral	received item from that supplier within 0 day .
neutral	eventually received email from proviation md offering me a discount , but was then too late , as i ' d already ordered elsewhere , sigh .
neutral	still , a nice_touch .
neutral	further problems : requested email confirmation of order cancellation , but never received any , and no sign of refund .
neutral	eventually had to open a paypal complaint to get my money back .
neutral	that did the trick , and now have my refund , today , almost 0_weeks after paying .
neutral	at the same time , received an_apology from md , which was nice , but it took a paypal complaint case to get it .
neutral	i may just have been unlucky ...
neutral	update ...
neutral	since posting the review , i '_ve had several emails from the proviation md , who has_been very helpful , apologised repeatedly , and given me a gift_voucher for a future order .
neutral	that '_s good service .
neutral	i still have a quibble with the " in stock " label ; it appears that they update this manually , and it doesn_'_t always get updated when items go out of stock .
neutral	i still find that unacceptable : if it isn_'_t in stock , it * mustn '_t * say " in stock ".
neutral	this should of course be automated .
neutral	perhaps it is , but if so something went badly wrong , since for quite a few_days it was saying " in stock " when it wasn_'_t .
neutral	i '_ve added a star , but with the caveat that it took a poor review here , and a paypal claim , to get any action , and the stock status issue is not ideal .
neutral	but certainly the issue is now resolved_satisfactorily .
neutral	i '_ll give them another go - to use my voucher :) - and report .
neutral	update 0 - it belatedly occurs to me that perhaps their " available from stock " does not really mean " in stock ".
neutral	i think it means " this item is one that we normally aim to keep in stock .
neutral	so it probably is in stock , we don_'_t know .
neutral	if not , we will let you know at some point after you have ordered it ".
neutral	this as_opposed to " this is not an item we normally keep in stock ".
neutral	if so , that would be fair_enough , were that well explained , but i didn_'_t see anything to that effect .
neutral	had i done , i may not have ordered anyway ...
neutral	but in this day and age , a website ought to be able to give an accurate " in stock " status , i feel , so it '_s still not ideal .
neutral	but at_least , were it explained_clearly , it would be caveat_emptor , and nothing to complain_about .
neutral	0 products damaged not packed well
neutral	would have been 0_stars but as the database on there side has_been down so unable to save my progress .
neutral	all in all a very enjoyable course & will_definately_use again in the future ( hope there system comes back online by then !)
neutral	flowers were lovely , but had to wait_till mid - day before they came , meaning couldn_'_t go out or make plans .
neutral	yodel ( the courier ) have given us problems before when they lost some mobiles we ordered in transit , and i recommend all companies stop using them .
neutral	great idea but when withdrawing money you dont get all of it they keep some after advertising on the site it costs notjing as they make their money from advertising which is lies
neutral	i am very pleased with the price but the booking experience left me concerned whether everything will go to plan at the airport .
neutral	i clicked to deselect the text service and cancellation_insurance , yet they still appeared on my final_bill .
neutral	because it is so difficult to edit the order , i went_ahead anyway and decided i might need these .
neutral	clearly this is more than just the " glitch " that the company mentioned in response to previous reviews .
neutral	the arrive return timing is confusing - the site advises you to use the actual flight arrival time , yet adds on a hour on the confirmation page - it should make this clear as i thought i ' d entered the time incorrectly and wasted time by starting again .
neutral	time will tell if i would have been better off paying more to book direct with the parking operator .
neutral	product is ok , but expected the added embroidery to be on all mats , not just the front ones .
neutral	i expected the product within 0 days due to your site , but it arrived after 0 days .
neutral	yodel are a hopeless delivery option sadly .
neutral	switch to dpd - i ' d pay extra .
neutral	but wife very happy to get funky new mats - so all well !
neutral	the shirts are outstanding , so much so i '_ve purchased 00 of em '.
neutral	the service provided is another issue all together ... no matter what shirt you buy it never seems to be in stock .
neutral	0_weeks appears to be standard for delivery know matter what you want .
neutral	dunno if this is just so that my money is sitting in there account for a while for whatever_reason .
neutral	even if by chance one of your shirts are ready & you happen to have purchased 0 , they will wait_until the other is ready before delivery , coincidently around the 0 week mark .
neutral	also .. they wont inform you of any of this , its not until you loose patience & phone up & ask that you '_ll get any information out of them .
neutral	i '_ve come to the conclusion that there '_s one person out the back making shirts on a loom .
neutral	my record so for is fastest - 0 0 / 0_weeks , slowest - 0_weeks .
neutral	the shirts are fantastic , the rest is just frustrating .
neutral	rather friustrated that the email advertised discounts didn_'_t flow through when attempted to use on ipad .
neutral	had to wait_until i got back home two_days_later to book using my imac .
neutral	part from that the application , layout and link to paypal option was very good .
neutral	we love the products and this was a second round of purchases from oakland_furniture .
neutral	on delivery , the two door section of a three door wardrobe was left down stairs and i was told something in the order of they are not allowed to lift 00kg above their head and over a balustrade .
neutral	for one it did not weigh 00kg and two , 00_% properties in london has a balustrade over which such furniture needs to be lifted .
neutral	me and a friend managed to do it , admittedly after taking it out of the packaging , but i reckon in today '_s society if that is what it takes to deliver the delivery service you advertise , that is what should be done .
neutral	looking for a new radial arm saw , have used tooled_up before , been happy with what i have ordered and speed of delivery , but this dewalt that i bought was completely_different from the video which was displayed under the caption for the saw i bought .
neutral	wether it was a genuine mistake or a ploy to get you to buy this saw , i dont_know , but be warned , take model no .
neutral	of any item and check with other_websites .
neutral	i ordered 0 bottles of coffee syrup on next_day delivery for a big occasion .
neutral	the item came as per the delivery slot time , but on arrival the package was smashed to bits and the syrup was all over the dpd van .
neutral	as a result the package was useless and had to be returned .
neutral	i had to purchase replacement bottles from another local supplier at a more_expensive price for the occasion .
neutral	i called and explained what had occured , followed_by an email and they arranged a new delivery which arrived as per the delivery ( this was much_better packaged ).
neutral	i asked for some form of good will gesture as i was out of pocket from buying the local product at higher cost , but this was glossed over and not made reference to .
neutral	i know its not their fault totally , but the packaging was poor and i have lost out financially .
neutral	may use again , but not on a time restriction !
neutral	cheap boxes delivered to me with no_hassle
neutral	brought the fantastic prophet 00 on a friday_afternoon , had a couple emails_advising payment hadn_'_t been taken which i responded quickly to and paid via_paypal .
neutral	i brought because the price was good and said next_day delivery which made me excited , with the thought " great will be with me monday !"
neutral	i received an email late_afternoon saying my order will be with me as soon as possible , i sent email back shortly_after , asking for confirmation if satuarday or monday ( didn_'_t want to wait in saturday if not necessary )..... nothing , no response either friday or saturday .
neutral	though disappoint no email , i was fine with that , after all it was late_afternoon on a friday ................ but " will be with you soon " to me is too vague , as i had tto take a day off to wait in for it on the monday , so i sent another email monday mid_morning asking if i should expect today ?
neutral	and if possible a tracking_number ...................... nothing , no email , no advisory .
neutral	i am pleased to say i recieved the synth early_afternoon so in that respect a happy customer ......... so whats my point .
neutral	0 .
neutral	when chasing payment juno was attentive and informative , but when i ( the customer ) had a question until this day i never received a reply .
neutral	0 . a straightword " your order will be with you monday " email would of meant i would not of even asked the question .
neutral	0 .
neutral	price is great , but great customer service means : i would of come to you first and more likely to buy from you again , instead i am indifferent when i next purchase another instrument ...... you are not ahead of the competition , infact even_though this is really quite minor , you dont appear to appreciate my custom ..... regardlless of spending over 0k with you .
neutral	i complained about the variation of a product - it has definitely changed since i last ordered it .
neutral	they were not very supportive - so i have given up trying .
neutral	i will not buy that product again .
neutral	i will stick to their whey_powder in future - as that is good valuable and very consistent .
neutral	just what was needed but not delivered within stated 0 days as arrived after 0 ?
neutral	as per prior times , order was complete , well_packaged , and priced ok .
neutral	but - slow .
neutral	over a week to dispatch .
neutral	we can '_t control shipping times , so i am not looking at that , but way too long between placing and order and confirmation of shipping .
neutral	also sagepay or whatever is a bit lame .
neutral	i placed the initial order in store at pc_world .
neutral	for whatever_reason the wrong part ( laptop battery ) was delivered to store .
neutral	so either the wrong part was ordered or a mix_up caused a different part to be delivered .
neutral	they had to re - order the part which did arrive a couple of days_later .
neutral	took a week for jam_golf to send me my club , they blamed the ups carrier but i ' d expect a better delivery service .
neutral	it happens !
neutral	we ordered half a dozen bulbs needed for replacements in our new house .
neutral	we searched the internet , found this supplier and carefully matched the description database with our requirements .
neutral	the order was processed quickly and delivery arrived the next_day .
neutral	sadly it was for the wrong items .
neutral	it was good to phone the company who explained a picking_error had been made .
neutral	the correct items were despatched and received with two_days , together with a returns_slip emailed to return the initial package at our convenience .
neutral	to summarise - a poor mistake a first but an excellent reaction by a company that understood our frustration .
neutral	will give them another opportunity in the future .
neutral	ordered first thing on a monday , received last thing on friday after calling up to ensure it would arrive .
neutral	wasn_'_t dispatched for 0 days , resulting in a late birthday_present .
neutral	would have been quicker to fly to uk and deliver the bloody things myself !
neutral	i am still trying to come to terms with the new glasses which seem to be taking a while to adjust to my eyes .
neutral	normally by now they would be fine but i guess i will have to wait a little_longer before they are finally_settled .
neutral	the website was fine but email contact was slow and delivery was even slower !!
neutral	i would not recommend this firm to friends .
neutral	i was disappointed in the slowness of response and delivery .
neutral	they also used parcelforce and they have a poor reputation which may have contributed to the slowness of the delivery .
neutral	ordered twelve medium_size but recieved sixteen small ones ?
neutral	we were a couple of friends on tour and rented 0 cars : car 0 reference_number_000000000 driver per tore boe / car 0 : 0000000000 driver roald rosendal .
neutral	boe has paid euro 000 while rosendal has paid euro00 , 00 on return .
neutral	boe has paid up front 00 . 00 . 0000 nok 0 . 000_,- rosendal has paid up front 0 . 000_,- both when ordered 00 . 00 . 0000 .
neutral	both cars are same ( polo or similar ).
neutral	why this difference .
neutral	bill reference boe : 00 / 0000000 .
neutral	bill reference rosendal : 00 / 0000000 .
neutral	regards per tore boe
neutral	ordered a new ibanez rg0000z gw last_week online .
neutral	this went_smoothly .
neutral	had email from shop saying it was out of stock and that i had to wait a couple of days for out to arrive .
neutral	no problem here , guitar arrived well_packaged within a couple of days .
neutral	shop told me it would be fully set_up but when it arrived 0 strings out of tune , locking_nut bolts all loose .
neutral	guitar plays_beautifully now .
neutral	however , ordered mid_january_0000 , the guitar that came is a 0000 model .
neutral	not sure what to do about it yet ?
neutral	towbar was a good price , and delivery was as stated , but the guy on the phone was abrupt and unhelpful .
neutral	would not buy from them again .
neutral	i purchased my part with one company but , it got damaged in transit .
neutral	they refunded the money to my account .
neutral	so i went to another breakers and purchased the same part at the same price .
neutral	very well_packaged and delivered next_day .
neutral	small mishap but will use them again .
neutral	service was good , but some flowers had broken blooms and they didnt look fresh .
neutral	time will tell how long they last .
neutral	website was good , but the recommendations to go with the product were flawed .
neutral	the right_angled valves didn_'_t fit as the mounting_brackets for the radiator don_'_t project it far enough forward to allow enough space between the angled valves and the wall .
neutral	needs to be supplied with stand - off brackets for the rad .
neutral	in order to use the r / a valves
neutral	once we ' d found the office in a dingy and stiflingly hot corner of an underground_car_park things improved .
neutral	speed of handover was dreadfully slow and despite five staff behind the counter , the wait to be seen was an uncomfortable 00 minute delay in poor conditions when we really wanted to start our holiday .
neutral	stung for exorbitant fuel_costs and non - negotiable insurance .
neutral	on the plus_side this did mean a worry free trip and looking at the scrapes on spanish cars that was no bad thing in the end .
neutral	hand back was very quick .
neutral	i booked a collection via parcelhero .
neutral	it was an international packet to usa .
neutral	i paid for an ' express ' service , with collection any time between 0000 /_0000_hrs .
neutral	i wasted an entire day , nine frustrating hours , sitting here , waiting for the courier ( fedex ) to collect .
neutral	at 0000_hrs , i tried to call parcelhero ’_s 0 . 0 pence_per_minute 0000 revenue - share line .
neutral	it closes at 0000_hrs !
neutral	so , if a collection is not made , you can ’_t get hold of the company until the next_day !
neutral	what ’_s more is its ‘ live_chat ’ isn_'_t ' live ' after 0000_hrs .
neutral	it closes at the same early time as the phone lines !
neutral	you don_’_t even get connected with some clueless live messaging centre operator in the third world ; it is just an e . mail service after 0 , dressed up as live_chat .
neutral	what was i supposed to do ?
neutral	sit here for another 0 hours like a fool , listening for the door_bell ?
neutral	i wanted to know why but parcelhero ’_s customer service lines had closed .
neutral	i was absolutely seething :-(
neutral	update 00 sep 00 .
neutral	i have to commend parcelhero for its customer service .
neutral	i have received and made numerous phone_calls from / to its staff , including its md .
neutral	i have been assured by him that the reason the collection failed was because fedex failed to fully record and pass on to its staff my collection address .
neutral	the village name and last 0 characters of the post_code had been omitted .
neutral	there are a few roads in this postal area with the same name as mine .
neutral	as a result , the fedex driver had visited an identical address in an adjacent village .
neutral	however , i do still have some criticisms of the parcelhero service .
neutral	above , i describe its customer service lines , which close at the same time as its last collection time of 0000_hrs .
neutral	in addition , it was ironically ‘ fortunate ’ that my package_containing 0 legal knives was not collected by fedex .
neutral	according to parcelhero staff , fedex does not carry knives and my parcel could have been impounded in uk by the authorities .
neutral	this would have caused me enormous stress and concern that 0 valuable items (£_000_gbp ) were impounded in uk , whilst the receiver in usa waited interminably and perhaps eventually would demand a refund .
neutral	i chose parcelhero to arrange carriage of these items since knives do not appear in its prohibited items list .
neutral	the parcelhero md advised me that he would ‘ look at ’ the parcelhero customer service closing time and in addition , consider including knives in its prohibited items list .
neutral	as a result , i am raising my score of parcelhero to 0 points .
neutral	good selection of drinks and rarities , price about right .
neutral	delivery date not met and no response to question raised .
neutral	bought north_face hedgehog iii .
neutral	the price at trekinn was substantially_cheaper_than elsewhere but the delivery date kept on getting put back .
neutral	waited over two_weeks for them to be delivered .
neutral	all was brilliant , then collected car early weds morning ..... exterior of car was absolutely filthy .
neutral	looked like it had been parked at a cement works for black cement !
neutral	i had the car valeted before going on hols .
neutral	if it were my company , i wouldnt hand cars back like it .
neutral	i visited a store in harlow for help with a car_seat .
neutral	the staff_member was polite and helpful , no_complaints there .
neutral	staff product knowledge was ok but you could tell they didn_'_t really know their stuff for this particular maxi - cosi seat ( several staff_members had gathered round at this time ) e . g .
neutral	which bases were compatible , product features , colour options , etc .
neutral	nevertheless the experience was positive overall simply because the staff_member was so helpful , and we also got a good deal on the day .
neutral	we ordered one of the items on - line in the store ( as the store did not stock the item ) and that order was delivered on - time and in good order .
neutral	i like the fact that the elc is a part of their group and they have elc items in their store too .
neutral	generally elc items are good for children and of satisfactory quality .
neutral	what is annoying however is that you can '_t use gift cards on - line - when i called customer_services up ( as i couldn_'_t believe this ), they told me they were trying to make this feature available .
neutral	this is 0000 , wake_up and get with it mothercare !
neutral	to summarise them in a few words .
neutral	they do knowingly oversell .
neutral	customer_services are so so and on some occasions are pretty crap .
neutral	they tend to deliver on time .
neutral	email responses are often very delayed and don_'_t answer everything you '_ve asked for - like pulling_teeth .
neutral	i wouldn_'_t recommend them , but they are better_than the likes of currys .
neutral	i don_'_t know why people rave_about them .
neutral	good product exactly right but delivery very slow .
neutral	there was a problem with the order .
neutral	however this was resolved and i was given an additional item f . o . c .
neutral	therefore the company is tying to offer a good service .
neutral	i would use them again !
neutral	arrived late , left for early flight in the morning , there only for 0 hours , great room , great bathroom but on my stay the electric sensor did not work , offered a room change but as needed to sleep simply used shower instead .
neutral	i will go back and i will stay again , then when the tap works i will give 0 * - 0 * does not give justice to this hotel
neutral	flowers , chocs and vase all great and on time .
neutral	overall price good compared to other big_names .
neutral	let_down by delivery though as they didn_'_t wait for my elderly mum to answer the door even_though i ' d ticked the ' please be patient ' box .
neutral	i got a message_saying they ' d been left ' in a secure place at the front of the property ' which actually meant on the doorstep , although i had left the neighbour '_s address if there was any problem .
neutral	luckily it was not raining and someone was able to bring them in for her .
neutral	i understand mothers_day is a busy day for deliveries , and my mum is very slow , but surely that '_s to be expected on mothers_day for quite a few recipients !?
neutral	why ask for special instructions if you can '_t keep to them ?
neutral	competitive price and polite customer service .
neutral	the email providing status_updates on the progress of the customers order , is a nice_touch .
neutral	receiving the wrong item was an inconvenience - the north_face bags clearly have what size they are on the side , so there was no excuse .
neutral	taking the time to double_check the item against the packing sheet is obviously important .
neutral	disappointed to have had to remind about refunding my postage and not offered any sort of discount for future orders .
neutral	however , i would return as i liked the website and understand mistakes can happen .
neutral	this was the third of three crossings in our motorhome which were booked at the nec last_autumn .
neutral	unfortunately we are not impressed with the meals .
neutral	all items of the english_breakfast were cold by the time we got to pay them and on our return the fish was overcooked .
neutral	we won_'_t book ahead at the nec this year as our tesco_vouchers for eurotunnel will be a cheaper option and we won_'_t have to worry_about meals .
neutral	it '_s a dhame because we always used to look_forward to our breakfasts on the ferry .
neutral	good website but still_waiting for my order
neutral	a really good experience in buying the watch at a good saving but when it came to ask for a receipt for insurance_purposes then absolutely no response to e_- mails or phone_calls & after 00 months i give up asking !
neutral	ordered a beautiful ralph_lauren design , was in stock at time of delivery .
neutral	received an email_stating there was a extended lead time on my delivery week_commencing 00 th december !
neutral	emailed back saying hope this was a typo and was meant 00th_january as didn_'_t really want to wait 00 months for my order .
neutral	also asked if could be delivered to my work address as was off work for the original scheduled delivery .
neutral	had a very nice apology stating was a typo , however no mention of delivery to my other address .
neutral	so of course was delivered to my home address which i missed of course and had to re - schedule .
neutral	a little grievance but my email should have been read properly and responded to !
neutral	service fine item fine but to charge £ 0 . 00 +£ 0 to deliver a package to this value / weight has left me adamant i would never use you again .
neutral	i would like to add your amazon agents + internet sellers all post this virtually free and you are the major importers of the product , why ?, the postage added 00_% to the cost .
neutral	ordered some sunglasses after finding a great deal on groupon ( props to that guys ) on a sunday_night .
neutral	the order processing took a little_longer_than_expected which is fair as the deal must be very popular .
neutral	my main problem with my order was that in ups .
neutral	0 .
neutral	they delivered my order to an entirely random address where i don_'_t live .
neutral	0 .
neutral	they promised to collect the mis_- routed parcel and delivery to the correct address on the same day ... and didn_'_t .
neutral	0 .
neutral	they finally delivered my parcel , but to a neighbour without leaving a card at my address !
neutral	and this was all in the middle of the queen '_s jubilee_weekend so my sunglasses will have been floating_around some ups van / picking centre for almost a week .
neutral	not good ... but hey , that '_s not sunglasses_shop '_s fault .
neutral	also , the instant message chat help service isn_'_t working too well .
neutral	i was passed around 0 separate operators and ended_up giving up and calling to get help when tracking incorrectly delivered order .
neutral	prices going up and delivery takes an age now , even 0st_class 0 to 0 days takes nearer 0 ( plus ive had some parcels never arrive ... perhaps stolen by royal_mail worker ?)
neutral	had great difficulties getting the network setup right .
neutral	windows 0 pro was showing a ' phantom ' network which in the end i recognised as such and deleted and for now at_least things are ok .
neutral	i wanted to ask a question but could not find any support links of any sort except fopr sales .
neutral	hp offers email support .
neutral	the machine ?
neutral	it was fine .
neutral	but unless i am mistaken about the support issue i will not buy from pcspecialist next time .
neutral	bought many items always had excellent service .
neutral	seems they have changed courier .
neutral	paid for a delivery described as next_day .
neutral	got an email_saying item was dispatched and the earliest it could be delivered was 0 days_later .
neutral	good easy web_site to use , sometimes delivery seems to take longer_than you might expect .
neutral	packageing is a bit naff , seems to be get a box and stuff things in . when arrives all items seem like they have been through a tumble_dryer .
neutral	what i '_m not clear about this car_hire episode is that the original total ( including excess_waiver_insurance ) quotation was €_000 , which was completely paid by december 0th ., and then my creit card is debited €_000 on at car pick - up ...!
neutral	help ...

neutral	the coach ride was comfortable and the guide was knowledgeable and offered information at many places along the way .
neutral	at each location ( salisbury , stonehenge and bath ) there was time to walk around , although at salisbury the free time was brief .
neutral	at_least we didn_'_t order the lunch which would have been rushed in the time given .
neutral	at stonehenge there was time to walk around and view .
neutral	at bath , there was some time to view and then it was back to london on the coach .
neutral	we had older children with us and for us and we felt somewhat detached from the rest of the group .
neutral	overall , a good experience for them to see places they have only read about .
neutral	i think we all felt a little bored by the time we reached bath .
neutral	you couldn_'_t ask for better value broadband and calls than my deal with talktalk ( previously tiscali ) but the different parts of the company don_'_t talk top each other and when something_goes_wrong the customer_services_department simply cannot fix it .
neutral	extreme measures and referral at a high_level through an industry advisor were the only way that i could resolve things - and my thanks go to the high_level complaints executive for restoring my service .
neutral	if you buy the blue stripey jobs in tesco then talktalk is your type of company but if you prefer to spend the extra on tesco_finest then it isn_'_t .
neutral	flowers are stunning but a bit disappointed that they are delivered in a box and not by hand courier as expected / suggested on delivery email .
neutral	the outer leaves are completely folded in half and the outer flowers have lost a most of their petals .
neutral	have had to untie the whole bouquet to try and space the flowers out and give them some room .
neutral	i was happy with the dealings with farnham , but i will not be using them again because they send items by city_link .
neutral	i saw nothing on the website to say this , so the first i knew was when i got an email from city_link . saying they would deliver that day , and would need a signature for the parcel .
neutral	i contacted them to arrange an_alternative as there would be no - one in , and was told they could not deliver to an_alternative address , could not deliver at the weekend and would not leave the parcel without a signature .
neutral	in the end i had to make a 00 mile_round_trip to pick it up from their depot .
neutral	there was a lot of options so took awhile to sort through , but that '_s mostly because i wasn_'_t looking for anything specific .
neutral	you are going to pay for quality on this site .
neutral	selection is vast and price ranges vary considerably .
neutral	one drawback of this site so_far is that my order still_hasn_'_t arrived and its been almost 0_weeks
neutral	purchased my sunglasses last_week arrived very quickly .
neutral	opened them up tried them on fitted and looked great !
neutral	i know it '_s petty but i wasn_'_t happy with the colour of the case they sent me so i emailed them to ask if we could do an exchange of the cases , yet to hear_anything back .
neutral	sunglasses themselves had a very minute fault which i noticed when i put them on for the second time , but as they didn_'_t responded to my first email i didn_'_t bother contacting them about this issue .
neutral	just won_'_t shop with them again !
neutral	the only online store i know of that has such a huge_range of nogne 0 beer as well as many other bands .
neutral	items are packed well and are delivered within the promised time_scale .
neutral	four of the beers in my order had gone mouldy .
neutral	i did receive a refund but there was a lack of communication from the company .
neutral	i would have preferred to have the beer replaced rather_than refunded .
neutral	a good online shop with a huge_range , let_down by a less_than perfect ( but better_than awful ) customer service .
neutral	i decided to buy new lenses through feel good lenses due to their competitive_pricing and their easy to use website .
neutral	i also placed my order via topcash_back .
neutral	however , since reviewing topcashback i have seen that all reviews are very poor in relation to the actual cash_back being refunded as promised .
neutral	my lenses have arrived and on time but , in line with all other topcashback comments , i have yet to see if the credit will be added to my account .
neutral	good delivery and price but if the topcash_back scheme is not going to be complied with , why should you be allowed to advertise as a member of topcash_back ?
neutral	while the car was ok i was charged 000_euros for tank of petrol .
neutral	car was returned with more than half tank of fuel making this a very expensive car_hire .
neutral	my partner wanted some funky patterned wellies for triumphant victory in the schoolyard fashion competition .
neutral	she bought almost_exclusively on design ( pattern ) rather_than functionality or price but we were pleasantly_surprised at the price of those she chose in the end .
neutral	delivery was very quick , no_qualms about the service at all , but we can see why they were so cheap .
neutral	the pattern is fine and i '_ve no doubt they '_ll keep her feet dry but they ' re an awful shape .
neutral	loads of ' bagginess ' at the calf that folds when you walk .
neutral	they ' re almost comical .
neutral	it '_s a shame for her as she wanted wellies people would turn to look at , now she '_s panicking that they might do exactly that !
neutral	tip_: know what you ' re buying ..!
neutral	!
neutral	oh , and care less what your peers think .
neutral	;)
neutral	fine little outfit but be careful with stroppy staff , if you nod or say yes to everything they tell you you may be okay but don_'_t disagree with what they say , it '_ll cost you one way or another .
neutral	look out for the extra_charges they hide in everything and be prepared to spend more than you save at the other end when faced with a long journey to where you thought you were flying .
neutral	example weeze to essen , 00 euro taxi_ride
neutral	great system but has a little problem listening to it '_s users
neutral	bought two lighting nets and a teddy_bear .
neutral	teddy arrived wihout any electrics .
neutral	a phone_call ensured they arrived the next_day .
neutral	good service and nice people but website and photos of garments could be better
neutral	the service provided by chemist_direct is very good , professional and prompt .....
neutral	..... but the cost of postage disappointingly negates the savings otherwise offered .....
neutral	an ability to use paypal instead of the tortious route via bank cards would be welcome ....
neutral	some of the larger , yellow orchids were turning_brown upon_arrival which you would not expect for the price of the arrangement .
neutral	otherwise , a nice arrangement
neutral	i have had two orders from your company , and i have been happy with price and the product .
neutral	but on both_occasions the delivery has taken significantly longer_than_expected .
neutral	i have no problem with 0 week lead times provided i know about them .
neutral	but your on - line ordering implies ex - stock delivery .
neutral	i will probably order from you again , but allow extra time for the goods to arrive .
neutral	the most confusing internet order i have ever had regarding shipping .
neutral	in the end i gave up trying to work out when my items would arrive .
neutral	i had emails saying things were on back order and could be weeks / months .
neutral	some items would be arriving on monday , tuesday and wednesday .
neutral	in the end nothing arrived monday .
neutral	recieved an email requesting confirmation that i still wanted some of the items on back order .
neutral	a long phone_call later , i confirmed .
neutral	tuesday some stuff came .
neutral	i called again to double_check some items that were on invoice / delivery receipt weren_'_t part of the delivery and they were missing .
neutral	was told they would be 0_weeks .
neutral	wednesday the items that were on back order and the item six_weeks away , arrived .
neutral	still missing one item .
neutral	who_knows when i get it !
neutral	site was easy to use , insurance is cheap and customer_services responded promptly to my email after purchase to confirm that sensible estimates of purchase dates and purchase prices are acceptable to them , and that it is okay to own extra appliances not included under the warranty .
neutral	so_far , so good ( and pretty good it has_been ).
neutral	however , the only real_test will come when and if one of my appliances breaks_down - but i suspect it is unlikely the services will be any worse than under various manufacturer warranties , most of which seem to be provided by d & g , and which are often pretty dreadful - for example we had a whirlpool fridge_freezer where the manufacturer '_s engineers kept on coming and swapping main boards without fixing the problem , and it turned_out the engineer was reselling the new boards on the black market and re - installing the faulty one !
neutral	had some good bargains from cash_generators online store , really like the free_postage promos they have from time to time and the quality of the goods is very good for 0nd_hand .
neutral	the majority of my orders have been cancelled and refunded as store stock is not updated on the website listings , and from time to time when they list something with the wrong price they say ' its just been sold in store today ' to get out of giving you a bargain .....
neutral	hello ig ,
neutral	we came to visit your shop on the 00 / 00 /_0000 and ordered a table and two chairs with you .
neutral	you confirmed an order to me on 00 / 00 /_0000 , order ref 0000000000 .
neutral	at the time of the order you said that the items were in stock and we should receive within 0 - 0 working_days well we still have not received the said items .
neutral	regards_keith gray
neutral	although my online booking confirmation stated that i only had to pay the agent another 00 . 00 euro '_s i had to swipe my card for a total of 000 . 00 euro '_s and not given the option of paying up front for a full_tank of petrol ( which i had no option ) or returning it full .
neutral	there were many people waiting , myself for 0 hour 00_minutes to get the keys then arguments were taking place when people were asked for more money with not much explanation .
neutral	but the car was clean with a full_tank and once with managed to find our way out of the car_park it was fine .
neutral	when we returned we were told to just drop the keys in a box at the end of the office .
neutral	now i '_m waiting to see how much they have taken from my account .
neutral	don_'_t use animed the delivery company are not reliable . tell_lies .
neutral	great service , tracking and delivery but the flowers came in a box and were disappointing when opened
neutral	- but need more detailed_instructions as to how they actually are fitted !!!
neutral	also remind me of naff seat_covers from the 00 / 00s !!
neutral	!
neutral	the service at my tuxedo was great - my shirt was dispatched promptly and i was given plenty of commuication .
neutral	unfortunately , this shirt wasn_'_t exactly the size we were expecting .
neutral	the length was a couple of inches lacking , same with the arms despite_being described as xl length .
neutral	lesson_learned - if the shirts were better fitting , i wouldn_'_t hesitate to use mt again , as the service was very commendable , but i cant trust the sizing metrix .
neutral	delivery and packing was about the same as other online grocers i '_ve tried , but unfortunately the food i received was lacking in freshness .
neutral	not sure if they just sent the stuff that was nearly out of date , but i '_ve never had a similar problem from other grocers .
neutral	i might have had a bad one - off , but we '_ve never been back !
neutral	when you buy a new item of furniture you do not expect holes to be filled in on the solid_wood .
neutral	this was obviously checked and passed quality control , is this a standard process within the company .
neutral	knowing this would be missed on cursory inspection upon_receipt
neutral	the last 0 orders have had extremely poor packaging with the product damaged or falling out .
neutral	good products though .
neutral	only given 0_stars as only just started and yet to see the results but i can say that the strawberry_flavour tastes great even mixed with just water .
neutral	service was quick and the website was really easy to use .
neutral	however the physio union_jack tape was really poor and would not recommend that product to my worse enemy .
neutral	the jessops advert was for £ 0 discount on snowglobes using a special code . i ordered two snowglobes using the special code and expected that both snowglobes would receive the discount , i later found that the discount_code only applied for one snowglobe therefore i suggest that the jessops advert was misleading .
neutral	good service
neutral	have tried other search_engines but google is deffo the best imo !
neutral	!
neutral	downside .... google_chrome !
neutral	!
neutral	very fast & love the way it '_s set_up with saving footprints etc .. but it just will not function along with certain websites .
neutral	i have come_across a few glitches but the main one has to be " paypal ".
neutral	upon doing some_research over the internet i have found out that they have known about compatability issues with certain website '_s but have chose to ignore it for years , in some cases !!
neutral	!
neutral	that '_s just not cricket !!
neutral	!
neutral	absolutely superb website but has dropped its usual standards due to the following sellers :- zoverstocks = fantastic prices & when the orders are correct , 00_% of the time they are in excellent condition ..... but , they take far too long to dispatch items , which seem to be getting longer & longer .
neutral	out of the last handful of orders i would say 00_% of them have been wrong , missing discs , wrong films , not as advertised ect .. ect ... customer service is pretty quick to rectify but when you wait about 00 days for an item which is wrong , not worth the hassle !!
neutral	!.
neutral	indigostarfish . com ( an amazon preferred partner ).... absolutely_shocking delivery times !!
neutral	!..... no comms whatsoever , items take about 0_weeks then one item from order was was then put back upto another 0_weeks ( 0_weeks in total !!
neutral	).... which was subsequently cancelled !
neutral	!... absolute_joke !
neutral	!
neutral	there are some great sellers on there though and take my advice , avoid the above 0 and you won_'_t go too far wrong !!
neutral	!
neutral	annoyingly can only enter a single discount_code even if have more .
neutral	payment_methods very limited too , but delivery fast and reliable
neutral	i ordered a particular tyre and was contacted 0 days_later to be told they were unable to provide that particular tyre they then tried to fob me off with poor tyres when i read the reviews of these tyres they were dreadful , ended_up having to spend more money than i wanted to , i have subsequently checked the website several_times and these tyres are still shown as available why when they aren_'_t felt rather disappointed by the experience
neutral	the person_who called me didnt come_across as a solicitor !
neutral	more so hearing dogs barking in the background was rather concerning and unprofessional and didnt speak like a solicitor !
neutral	with alot of um , and uhh conversation wasnt impressed
neutral	hired a mercedes e_- class - for a special_occasion - good that it was a 00 plate - 0 areas of damage worthy of note not so good - car had been given a quick wash down and water drying marks were still evident - wheels had been given a quick wash over and were left dirty in all the nooks and crannies - tyres were left dirty .
neutral	a car like this is quite likely to be hired for a special_occasion so such things should be attended too - we had to spend an_hour cleaning it before it could be used .
neutral	ont the upside the rental price was competitive and the staff at europcar / alamo were very friendly and helpful .
neutral	i thought they were very good at communicating the status of the delivery .
neutral	everything from dispatch through to delivery at address .
neutral	i must_say however , although the bunch of flowers were lovely and well balanced , i was quite disappointed at the size of the bunch .
neutral	it isnt made clear that the flowers would be so small .
neutral	they were very similar to a small £ 0 bunch from a supermarket .
neutral	i was happy with the service , but slightly_disappointed with the product .
neutral	perhaps its needs to be clear how small the bunch will be .
neutral	having already bought a photobook from jessops i purchased a second photobook from photoworld after_seeing the rave review on television , but it '_s a shame because the product shown on the tele wasn_'_t the book they sent to me .
neutral	both proto world and jessops sell the cewe book but are vastly different in quality .
neutral	don_'_t buy from photoworld because the quality of jessops product is far_superior even_though they charge more - you only get what you pay for .
neutral	had problems with iphone_app booking onto am ferry not pm as requested would be careful .
neutral	my issue with company has_been resolved but would recommend times on iphone_app after noon read 00 , 00 , 00 etc not 0 pm 0 pm also could have been a lot_easier to resolve this at initial point of contact not by me leaving negative_review
neutral	overall the site isn_'_t bad and its a good way to find parts but be careful which breaker you use because some are quite bad and take a very long time getting your order sorted , for example it took 0_weeks for my order to be sorted when it said 0 - 0 days .
neutral	wae sent me an email promising free_postage for my next order but i was charged for postage all the same .
neutral	would like to see a quick info transfer to booking from rewards account
neutral	nice trophy , just wish it was delivered sooner !
neutral	picked_up car at milan airport ( having fully paid for everything ) and even with 0 people manning the desks , i had to wait a full 00_minutes before i walked out of the office .
neutral	not sure why everything needed to be so slow ( about 00_mins per person on average at the desk ) when everybody had already entered all their details when booking on - line .
neutral	car was fine though and good value , by booking early .
neutral	return at pisa_airport was quick and painless .
neutral	delivery was quick .
neutral	the the inflatable party decoration seems to not hold the air very well and deflates within minutes .
neutral	not worth the good service , really .
neutral	i '_ve ordered a few things from bbw and they are great quality and usually arrive very quickly .
neutral	this time however was a little frustrating .
neutral	i had an email and text to tell me it would be delivered between 00 . 00 & 00 . 00 that day including a tracking_link .
neutral	i followed this link at 00 . 00 to see my parcel was only round the corner but would be another 0hr_00mins as it was on drop 00 and mine was 00 .
neutral	fair_enough i thought , but then the delivery never turned_up .
neutral	it was delivered the next_day instead .
neutral	i had no notification that it would be late .
neutral	i guess overall it was still delivered fairly swiftly but i ' d rather have not had a notification saying it was due the first time round if it wasn_'_t going to turn_up .
neutral	service very good but your but your xmas offer did not did work .
neutral	it not run out till may .
neutral	i ordered 00 00 page a0_leaflets for a client .
neutral	unfortunately 0 of them were unusable as the front cover had been printed 0 time on the first few pages .
neutral	in the worst case , it had been repeated 0 times !
neutral	i ' d also asked for a gloss_finish on the covers , as that was what my client had asked for .
neutral	the finish i received was definitely not gloss , but more of a semi gloss .
neutral	not sure i '_ll use solopress again for such a job unfortunately
neutral	good price - plastic is cheap and a bit nasty - had to drill_holes to put tent_pegs through them to hold them down - otherwise okay .
neutral	the whetstone was smaller than i had envisaged and i found it cheaper in the shops .
neutral	when i added on the price of postage and packing it was significantly more_expensive .
neutral	removable tow_bar fitted in time advised .
neutral	when i went to collect vehicle and have quick demo on how to connect and disconnect removable bar , it did not locate properly , so adjustments were then made on the roadside , clearly this had not been checked during fitting and i could have had a wasted_journey to return the vehicle had i taken this on trust .
neutral	i could not check the electrics until i collected my trailer , which was yesterday , everything works_perfectly .
neutral	the number_plate i pre_- ordered and paid for was also not ready on collection and i had to wait for this to be done .
neutral	whilst overall i am happy with the product and its performance , the administration of the sale process needs_improving .
neutral	was okay but probable wont use again , some of the flowers were broken and turning_brown and not worth the money , thought it was going to be bigger but pretty disappointed to be honest !
neutral	i '_ve only used skiddle once so_far , but they '_ve asked for my opinion and so_far i ' d say above_average .
neutral	ask me again in a few_months !
neutral	this is the second time that an item on the order has_been ' in stock ' on the web_site but then unavailable when it comes to the order being dispatched to me .
neutral	quickly refunded but would prefer to have the items , rather_than having to go_elsewhere later .
neutral	charged extra for immediate delivery which failed , ordered standard spec but told i ordered custom fit if that was the case only needed reading and they would have noticed it was a standard club which they had in stock so wasted 0 days .
neutral	i ordered and paid for a nw golf_bag and after a week i get an email to say they don_'_t have the colour i want , why does it take a week ?
neutral	after expecting delivery a couple of days after paying to .
neutral	find out some week_later it '_s not in stock was very poor .
neutral	items arrived well_packaged and within just afew days after ordering .
neutral	however , the products haven_'_t worked and my dogs still have fleas .
neutral	asked several questions about proposed purchase and no one was able to help , had to go and risk the item being sold while i consulted the web .
neutral	we had a couple of pieces damaged but the customer service
neutral	was quick and friendly and new pieces were out quickly .
neutral	would recomend to anyone looking for quality at a good price .
neutral	i have not received enough spikes and the spikes aren_'_t long enough to fit in the boots
neutral	can these be sent ?
neutral	i ordered a costume for a fancy_dress stag_do and received the costume the next_day which was outstanding delivery .
neutral	unfortunately , i purchased a large ( being a medium to large build ) and the costume was small to medium at best .
neutral	your sizing_guide might need a bit of work but all in all everything came very fast and looked good .
neutral	i paid for 00 panic bolt tubes on line on 00 / 00 /_0000 , i received a phone_call saying that the tubes you had in were broken and you had ordered some more and would dispatch my order on thursday i also paid for next_day delivery but have yet still to receive my order if i don_'_t get it on monday 00 / 00 /_0000 i will require a full_refund .
neutral	as many sites where you buy online client need to subscribe to terms and conditions which are , as usual , too long to read thoroughly .
neutral	then you find your email bombarded with requests of reviews , surveys , product suggestions .
neutral	which are difficult to stop , given to third_parties whom start sending emails etc .
neutral	etc .
neutral	before you know your email is clogged with spam_emails .
neutral	i understand they try to be useful but please , let us buy a product , pay for it , received it ; that should be it .
neutral	more emails or spam sent do not mean that customer will buy more , on the contrary .
neutral	it '_s like going to the shop and after you paid and collected your good you get an annoying assistant that simply doesn_'_t let you go until you say why you buy what you do with things , next ten_years products wish_list .
neutral	for god sake , leave us alone : i came , i bought , i paid , got what i need , what else do you want ?
neutral	leave us alone !
neutral	one purchase 0 emails : thank_you for the order , order received , payment processed , order passed to warehouse , goods sent , feedback request , survey ....... next time we go to a shop .
neutral	suggestion : upon order check out ask to tick_boxes about communications preferences .
neutral	great example of terms and conditions : " we will process your order and not pass any of your details to nobody , after 0 months we also delete all your details from our systems .
neutral	if you are unhappy with your purchase you need to contact us with copy of the delivery note , if you didn_'_t receive your goods contact us to trace the delivery .
neutral	thank_you for your purchase ".
neutral	other that that the website interface is user_friendly , nice description of the items , speedy delivery , unbelieveable packaging for a pair of headphone sponges ( i though i received a television ).
neutral	good site and service but please leave us alone once done .
neutral	product as_described but nest day delivery did not happen
neutral	brilliant professional customer service focused and helpful but national_tyres kilmarnock have ruined my alloys
neutral	i placed two orders with more value necessary to qualify for free delivery .
neutral	i was not made aware that to qualify you can not mix medication and toiletries to qualify for free delivery
neutral	paid for fast delivery and took_ages :( but product good
neutral	some financial decisions that you make in life are crucial .
neutral	the advice you receive has to be consistent , professional and accurate .
neutral	key_retirement solutions gave_me two supportive , comprehensive and fully informative free consultations and answered most of my worries and concerns .
neutral	their representative was as good as you can get .
neutral	he delivered everything with total truth and honesty and went out of his way to explain all the facts .
neutral	making decisions from options_available is made much_easier when you are dealing face to face with someone as good as malcolm_severs .
neutral	he was friendly , completely honest and very human in his approach .
neutral	i consider myself fortunate to have met malcolm and i would not_hesitate to recommend him to anyone who has to look at this subject in detail and in depth .
neutral	it is perhaps useful to report that my equity_release application was declined - no reflection on malcolm but don_'_t assume ( as i did ) that this company is all sweetness and light !
neutral	i would now hesitate to recommend key .
neutral	dealings with another market_leader have been somewhat more supportive than key_retirement solutions as a company .
neutral	hello ,
neutral	i ordered two crewe photobooks .
neutral	i was happy about some things and not others .
neutral	the biggest complaint - crucial when printing photos - is that the images were printed with insufficient dpi , causing the photo quality to suffer considerably - the images were nowhere_near as ' crisp ' as had been achieved elsewhere .
neutral	other than this ( major ) complaint , i was reasonably pleased .
neutral	the program was easy to use , and i was very happy with the flexibility in layout options ( this is an excellent feature ).
neutral	delivery was prompt .
neutral	however , i ordered two photo_books ( via amazon loacal deals ), but had to have them delivered separately .
neutral	i would have liked for them to be delivered simultaneously - saving time , money , and being more environmentally_friendly ( i . e ., less packaging , more efficient transport & delivery ).
neutral	unfortunately the company don_'_t show sizes for , in my case ' rain suits ' so when they arrived they were far to small , had to return the
neutral	them and as today no refund has_been made , but it '_s only 0 days ago , the search goes on , and to be fair i have not found a site which has sizes for large , xl , xxl and so on .
neutral	i ordered an exercise_bike and was happy with the price .
neutral	however , when i tried to pay / checkout the system advised me that i lived in the scottish_highlands - which i don_'_t !
neutral	- and wanted to charge an extra £_00 for delivery !
neutral	i called customer_services and they would not change the order .
neutral	i changed the delivery address to a family_members house ( 0 miles_away !)
neutral	and it was delivered today without the extra_charge .
neutral	very poor customer service !
neutral	item all ok but postage is very expensive and a very poor service , paid £ 0 to get it next_day and it still took 0 days .
neutral	!!
neutral	uttings say postage is nothing to do with them which is a very poor response .
neutral	the item turned_up but took longer_than the 00 working_days they stated
neutral	it took 0 months to arrive to the uk
neutral	i have brought stuff from china before but never had to wait 0 months
neutral	it was a good price but you have to wait a long time for the item to arrive
neutral	however the next item has not arrived yet so i can '_t comment , other than to say that when moving through the order process i never found the box to get free_postage having gone_through the order process twice .
neutral	what seemed to be a good sale discount was marred_by a similar product for less !
neutral	when the order arrived 0 out of 00 items were wrong and had to be returned ( no problem to return just delayed things another week ) quality of the manufacture was poor , ie nails not always in the right place !
neutral	their quality control could be improved .
neutral	took days and days to ship to cutting firm .
neutral	£_00 for a single sheet of teflon is a bit over the top .
neutral	it '_s nice material when supplied though .
neutral	initial offer was tempting , due to the discount and the coffee has_been worth it .
neutral	however , a subscription is no_longer of interest to me personally , so i wrote to cancel in the beginning of january , only to be still charged in february !
neutral	pity the admin isn_'_t as good as the product !!
neutral	!
neutral	items received next_day which was good .
neutral	however 0 items missing from one of the shelving sets and two storage_boxes damaged , the damage could have been down to ukmail .
neutral	no customer service at the weekend .
neutral	called monday and spoke to cs and the replacements were ordered without an issue and these also arrived at 0am the next_day .
neutral	the actual shelving is very good and easy to assemble so all in all pleased with the purchase .
neutral	i was told that the delivery company would call when the furniture was ready to arrange delivery and i would be given the option to arrange suitable time if the one offered was not acceptable .
neutral	i was also told by the salesman that a 0 hour time_slot would be given for delivery .
neutral	i was given a 0 hour time_slot and was told that if i couldn_'_t accept delivery then they would give me another slot in a few_days time but once again at the delivery companies convienience not mine !
neutral	having said that the furniture arrived in perfect_condition .
neutral	had there been any_problems i would not have been very happy .
neutral	i ordered my girlfriend flowers to be delivered to her work on valentines_day , the flowers arrived and are gorgeous and she_loved them .
neutral	however , the delivery man was very rude , walked in dropped the box down and said ' here we go , i don_'_t know who they are for ' and walked out .
neutral	it clearly says on the box who to deliver the flowers too and when paying for a bouquet of flowers for be delivered i expected them to go to her and not be dumped in the office for all the staff to read and find out who they were for .
neutral	very disappointing .
neutral	not the cheapest can buy same quality elsewhere cheaper
neutral	after using over the years a number of suppliers
neutral	glasses0you regarding time between paying and receiving item g0y slowest
neutral	katie provided good customer service with another advisor showing she needed some product training .
neutral	suggest emails from customer are acknowledged .
neutral	mine weren_'_t and there was the need to ring them when emails could have sufficed .
neutral	o processo de aquisição é simples , mas a encomenda demorou muito tempo a chegar .
neutral	a empresa seur teve dificuldades na entraga porque a morada não estava completa no endereço da_encomenda ( faltavam o 0 números finais do código postal ).
neutral	o_vosso site não está devidamente preparado para os códigos postais de portugal .
neutral	i first purchased a 0000 rolex sub from watchfinder in may 0000 but not quite happy with the watch ( even_though this does not reflect on the fine service provided by tommor holland initially ) i continued searching watchfinder web_site and up came a 0000 sub which was my sons birth year . having made enquiries about part_ex the 0000 sub with the 0000 with sam_beer a deal was struck and i sent off my watch to watchfinder . a couple of days_later i recieved a call from jonathan brett saying i had to pay an extra £_000_pounds due to the watch having a small chip on the glass , now this is the problem . this chip was already on the watch when i recieved it ( in the 0_weeks of owing the watch it has_been stored well and only worn twice ) thinking that due to the cheap price this is what you obviously get , obviously this was missed before sending out to me or some member of staff is telling porkie pies .
neutral	my 0000 sub is great but i feel that watchfinder have squeezed an extra £_000 from myself and that has left me with a slight bad_taste !!
neutral	!
neutral	ok so i loved sky go when it came out and the recording aspect .
neutral	problem is that sky is far too expensive for what it is .
neutral	the films are 0 - 0 years old unless you want to pay for box office .
neutral	the other channels just don_'_t float the boat , 000 channels and nothing on .
neutral	the only thing i now watch is the footie 0 - 0 times per_month , so i '_ll be off down the pub and will get properly oiled on the £_00 i give to sky .
neutral	really like muscle_foods .
neutral	their food is excellent as well as their prices .
neutral	they have way to go with customer service , they rarely provide anything more than a poor explanation when something_goes_wrong on their part .
neutral	my friends and i bought tickets for rod on 0 june at men .
neutral	the seats , as promised , were fantastic , block b , row j - 0 rows from the stage .
neutral	however , when the tickets arrived we were not seated together as one of the tickets had been sent to someone_else and we had theirs .
neutral	double0tickets sent us a text_advising that we should go to the seats originally allocated in row j .
neutral	the officials at the arena would not allow this , indicating that double0tickets do not have the authority to make that statement .
neutral	we managed to sort it out in the end ourselves .
neutral	the biggest disappointment was that the face value of the tickets was £_00 and we paid almost three_times that much for each ticket .
neutral	people we spoke to sitting in our row and around us paid £_00 .
neutral	it pays to shop around !
neutral	despite this the concert was brilliant .
neutral	very good price but quality of product could be better
neutral	will use again as have been perfect up until now , still_waiting for an email reply since friday
neutral	happy with the service and the car .
neutral	however , i feel having to pay for a full_tank of fuel and trying to return the car on empty is somewhat of a scam .
neutral	any fuel left is then charged to the next customer even_though i paid for it .
neutral	i would rather have an option to return the car with a full_tank .
neutral	this trip i did very little driving and had no option to return the car with half a tank of fuel .
neutral	how is that fair to the customer ?
neutral	the new yodel llandudno branch didn ` t have the ability to track deliveries of goods picked_up by their people .
neutral	neither did they seem to feel that they actually had any responsibilities to their customers for same .
neutral	they did however supply a telephone_number for me to ring , interparcel - 00000_000000 , who gave a helpful , pleasant , and very quick help to my queries .
neutral	none of the above would have been necessary of course if the on - line interparcel tracking site had accepted the tracking_details provided , and used , by yodel .
neutral	john barnes , anglesey .
neutral	the flavor wasn_'_t as strong as i expected .
neutral	and instead of apple flavor i receive white chocolate flavor .
neutral	the bottel could be more secure with a plastic foilaround the cup .
neutral	you are now taking more making it a bit more worthwhile dealing_with your company , keep it up and i can send you more .
neutral	regards
neutral	lou miller
neutral	ordered from here a couple of times and it is a little_bit cheaper then other_sites , but the delivery is always a few_days late - frustrating .
neutral	we are delighted with all our mugs .
neutral	they took time to create but the email support was very helpful .
neutral	we just found it a niggle that the free_postage was not automatically taken off .
neutral	we bought 0 mugs and had to pay full postage .
neutral	lots of other_companies seem to be able to take postage off automatically hopefully photoworld will be ab
neutral	le to do the same one day soon .
neutral	the villa is situated on a private residential complex , sadly we found the neighbours to be aloof and unhelpful in terms of parking their vehicles over our driveway access !
neutral	the villa_itself appears very tired inside , must doors stick , the furniture is dated and very basic .
neutral	the kitchen had a serious mite / ant infestation which we managed to combat / control by keeping everything in the fridge !
neutral	and spraying the area with chemical repellants .
neutral	the safe is almost inaccessible .
neutral	the main bathroom is damp & smells musty , the jacuzzi bath , one of the selling points of the villa , doesn_'_t work !
neutral	no visit from the rep , 0st time in 0 we '' ve not been visited to make_sure all was ok , call me cynical but i can see why !
neutral	overall we were disappointed , without_doubt the worst villa_plus experience we have had , we would not return to this villa !
neutral	very helpful staff , no problem there .
neutral	very disappointed with the product purchased from makita , half of it was missing and not even so much as a ' sorry ' or a ' drill bit ' for their poor performance .
neutral	you may wish to reconsider your courier apc , what a shower of s -- t !!
neutral	!
neutral	as a first time customer , not too impressed - regardless of how much i spent !!!
neutral	!
neutral	as i said the flowers where lovely .
neutral	but sad to say they only lasted a few_days as they started dying , which was a bit_disappointing .
neutral	again thanx
neutral	edward mckenzie .
neutral	hi was pleased with the quick service but when we got our car back it was really dirty .
neutral	there was a smearing of dust all over the car plus bird_droppings which cost my husband £_00 to get it cleaned .
neutral	i booked a day trip to edinburgh , which i did enjoy , but it would have been better had there been a courtesy pickup at my hotel .
neutral	there was some_confusion at kings_cross station which left us feeling a little_nervous_about the booking .
neutral	also the train trip , next time i would book first_class as the standard booking that i received was very noisy
neutral	waited in all day for my booked appointment , 0 :_00pm i get a phone_call saying the machine is down , i was pretty unconvinced .
neutral	re - arranged for a couple of days_later reluctantly and they turn_up at 0 :_00pm .
neutral	seriously save_yourself the money and time and get yourself to a local_dealer to get one fitted .
neutral	i '_m not one to go about writing negative_reviews after every little problem but i just had to make people aware of this one .
neutral	found them through google and to be fair they are pretty_much the cheapest out there .
neutral	my first order with them just never arrived and the blame was passed on to the delivery company , having to wait 0_weeks for them to file a compensation claim before being sent a replacement .
neutral	then my 0nd dealing_with this company was just as farcical , firstly trying to use the prescription upload system which is clearly broken and then being told a week_later after i ' d already had an order confirmation_email_stating they are waiting for my prescription before they can send the items out , clearly not good enough in my book .
neutral	i can only think that the managers at the airport are so lacking in empathy with their passengers , that they genuinely have no idea how universally outraged we are at this cynical charge .
neutral	also it '_s more than a little irritating when arriving in edinburgh to have to disembark the aircarft , walk upstairs and then back down again when there are surely more direct routes to the baggage carousels .
neutral	presumably this strategy is to parade the passengers past the shops in the hope that they will be overcome with an uncontrolable to buy something .
neutral	i rather think that most people just want to get away from the airport as soon as possible .
neutral	the order arrived ( well almost , read on ) next_day , but ... the courier had twenty boxes on a pallet which was never going to fit through our office door .
neutral	the courier man was adament that he would not break down the pallet but would quite happily let one of the office ladys do it !
neutral	i phoned kenable and they were very helpful and appologetic and said we would get the delivery via a different courier .
neutral	00 of the boxes arrived next_day and the other 0 a day latter .
neutral	packaging and handling resulted_in some knocks to boxes and we had to open most of the cat0 boxes up to get the starter cable out again .
neutral	boxes are not as good as excel and need to be taped_up to stop them coming apart when pulling cable out .
neutral	i may use them again , subject to some guarantees about the quality of delivery .
neutral	i was happy with the product and the price but the delivery company and there timing were terrible .
neutral	there tracking was non_existent and when the box arrived it has a large foot print embedded into it where someone has stood on the box .
neutral	i think this is a terrible was to deliver a parcel .
neutral	i have a photo of the box i would like to forward to you to show this .
neutral	items were as_described and were dispatched quickly .
neutral	however , despite the delivery intructions to " leave with a neighbour ", the chosen delivery firm sent the package to my local post_office which is only open 0 - 0 .
neutral	so i had to take time off work to collect the items in time for the stag_do .
neutral	great on delivery speed , choice and quality but unfortunately many items are often out of stock forcing the buyer to go_elsewhere !
neutral	i applied for talk_talk on - line via topcashback which would have earned me £_00 . 00 for the package i wanted .
neutral	three_times the site said talk_talk was unavailable for my postcode when i know it is .
neutral	finally postcode accepted .
neutral	the seconds to check the '' phone line turned into five minuted so i used live_chat .
neutral	this was fine as far as it went .
neutral	the line was checked and was ok .
neutral	i asked how i arranged to pay line rental in advance and was told it was an option in the basket .
neutral	thirty_minutes on and i am now able to proceed but could not see how to chose annual line rental payment .
neutral	telephoned and was told paying line rental upfront was not an option on the internet but this could be done over the telephone .
neutral	i have taken out a contract but am very disappointed with the internet experience .
neutral	frustrating , time wasting and because it could not be completed om - line it has cost me £_00 . 00 .
neutral	my current_provider is sky , by default as i was an o0 customer .
neutral	i am moving because i consider sky to have poor customer service .
neutral	i hope talk_talk will live up to my expectations and the assurances to that end given by your customer service operative .
neutral	authorising the topcashback payment would be appreciated .
neutral	because i '_m over 00 and this was an nhs prescription , my purchase cost a total of £ 0 . 00 .
neutral	pharmacy0u delayed delivery in order to leave a phone message that there were problems with my credit_card which apparently could imperil my payment of £ 0 . 00 .
neutral	( there are in fact no_problems with my credit_card , except that i '_ve just moved to a newly_built home whose postcode , though registered by the post_office , does not yet appear on the databases of some private companies , such as pharmacy0u ).
neutral	the corner of the record cover was bashed in and creased and it didn_'_t happen in the post because the outer_packaging was perfect .
neutral	also you can always tell a new record because they stick to the inner sleeve .
neutral	these didn_'_t
neutral	after_researching the part that i needed on the internet i decided to order from discounted heating .
neutral	i had some issues with the website which took me to the wrong page of detailed_information for the item that i needed but the price was right and the check - out process simple .
neutral	i was convinced that something on the site had told me that the item was in stock but that may have been another site that i was looking at .
neutral	anyway , it turned_out not to be which only became_apparent when i got an update to my order on the day i was expecting to receive it !
neutral	i contacted the company and they offered an immediate_refund - which was good - but i decided to stick with it .
neutral	i was given a new estimated delivery date at that time but i was then informed ( in good time ) that it was still not available from the distributors .
neutral	the item finally turned_up around two_weeks_later than_expected .
neutral	it was exactly_what i needed , was well_packed , and shipped overnight .
neutral	so , a mixed review .
neutral	on the plus_side , the item was as_described , well_packed , at a competitive price and , following an initial_hiccup , the communication_regarding the state of my order was good ; on the negative side , they did not have the item in stock , the initial communication could have been a bit more timely and the website has a wrong link .
neutral	would i deal with them again ?
neutral	probably - as long as the price is right i can put the negatives down to bad_luck which could happen to anyone so i would give them a second chance .
neutral	this was my first visit to wittards and there was a large variety of coffees and teas to choose from .
neutral	however , as a non tea drinker and someone for whom caffeine is a sure - fire way to a sleepless_night , i was very disappointed to only be offered one type of decaffeinated coffee .
neutral	there was also no information of the method used to remove the caffeine which influences my choices .
neutral	still , i thought it worth trying in case it was the one for me and bought 000 gms , all nicely_packaged by hand by a very pleasant assistant and then came my next shock - the price !
neutral	far more than i was expecting .
neutral	eager to see if it was worth the cost , i loaded some beans in the machine and awaited the outcome .
neutral	pleasant enough but nothing special to make me want to spend an extra pound or two over supermarket own brands .
neutral	i '_m_sure that those able to drink caffeinated drinks could_find something to suit them from the huge_array available , but it '_s not worth the extra_cost for the single choice of decaffeinated .
neutral	it '_s out there , why not expand the range ?
neutral	no_problems with hotel information and following instructions for reservation , quick and easy to understand .
neutral	however booking a hotel in new_york , although no doubt mentioned somewhere , some of the final information i only found at final booking and afterwards .
neutral	that with pre_- authorisation of my card a block was put on to the cost of the first night .
neutral	to the cost of the room , although city tax and occupancy tax were stated as excluded , a tax recovery and and fees charge was added .
neutral	the cost of the room was shown in pounds_sterling , the final booking in dollars but no declaration of exchange_rate .
neutral	like all web sites one should always search for and read the small_print !
neutral	quite easy to do but does the price when booking a car include the driver .
neutral	th booking form is not clear
neutral	ordered on a thursday and all was dispached quickly .
neutral	the only thing is that it went from birmingham to leeds , back to birmingham , and then back to leeds .
neutral	i finally went to leeds on the saturday_morning to collect before it went on another trip to birmingham .
neutral	when i got my purchases home they were fine and work really well , the multi is great for cleaning the car and they perform as well as the adverts reckon .
neutral	i bought three memory_modules , one for a samsung_netbook and 0 x_0gb_modules for a macbook .
neutral	unfortunately one of the macbook modules was faulty , which took me about an_hour to diagnose what was wrong .
neutral	i had to return the memory before they ' d ship a new one .
neutral	fair_enough , but i would have preferred to have had a new module sent immediately together with an invoice that i would have had to pay if i hadn_'_t returned the faulty_module within say 0 days .
neutral	it put me back four days as it was across a weekend .
neutral	if the memory had been properly tested in the first place , this wouldn_'_t have happened .
neutral	very good communication as 0nd part of my order was delayed as smeg let them down a couple of times which ended_up delaying my project completion by 0 days and costing me extra for the plumber returning to complete .
neutral	but as stated your sales_team apologised and communicated very well .
neutral	glasses were ordered with delivery not to my home address ( delivery address confirmed in order acknowledgement ) but delivered to home address anyway .
neutral	customer service were unhelpful when i complained and seemed to find it hard to say " sorry , we messed_up ".
neutral	glasses ok though .
neutral	been ordering from these_guys for a while now approx 0 years but last few_times i have ordered i always get a phone_call to say the item not in stock .
neutral	and i have paid for fast delivery .
neutral	i would understand if it happens once or twice but this is annoying as i almost expect it now every time i order .
neutral	i will use them again as i '_m used to dealing_with them and trust there products but if it happens once more i will_definitely be going else where as it is happening to much .
neutral	delivery charges are steep which is where i guess they are clawing back their margin .
neutral	the website is well_laid_out , the hard_sell technique in terms of additional items , ( vase , balloons etc ) are the only area that makes your site feel cheap and gimmicky .
neutral	i usually buy from john_lewis all my flowers so lets_see the quality of flowers you deliver .
neutral	as they say the proof is in the pudding .
neutral	if they are awful i will come_back and say so , if they are of a reasonable quality i will come_back and say so .
neutral	good place to buy if you use standard prescription_lenses , but getting varifocals right first time seems to be a problem . they are prepared to keep adjusting the lenses if you ask them to , but who_wants to keep bouncing glasses backwards and forwards until they get them right ???
neutral	i have worn varifocals for fifteen_years_now and have never had a problem with the lenses being right first time before .
neutral	let_me start by saying that the summer_house is great now it '_s finished .
neutral	waltons delivered as promised on saturday , and we got round to putting it together sunday .
neutral	all was going well until we got to the roof .
neutral	only 0 sheets of ply had been delivered , which left us with a summer_house with no roof .
neutral	not a problem , middle of summer .
neutral	if only , massive storm on the tuesday and rain wednesday , flooding the inside .
neutral	spoke to waltons first thing monday and told that they would send out the missing parts but could take up to 0 working_days , which was not acceptable .
neutral	after 0 separate conversations , and growing frustration they eventually delivered the missing parts thursday .
neutral	the quality of the small sheets of ply were very poor however , with the edges coming apart on all sheets .
neutral	could not wait for further parts so lots of wood_glue and screws needed to get it put_together decently .
neutral	as someone_else has mentioned , the roof is very flimsy .
neutral	considering the price i struggle to understand_why they cannot supply thicker ply to give a more robust roof .
neutral	would happily pay an extra £_00 or so for this .
neutral	all in all , frustrating experience , although happy with the final product , just could have been so much_better .
neutral	some pretty good prices , but hate that you have to sign up with a paypal_account .
neutral	nice bouquet , but abit small .
neutral	excellent start , good site and booking was done nice and fast .
neutral	once @ dubai airport we received a terrible car , old , full off scratches and not in line with what we expected .
neutral	after we complained we got " an upgrade " which meant , same car other color .
neutral	what do you do ?
neutral	we accepted the car , tired , and left to drive to the hotel .. by the way with an empty gas tank so we had to drive thru half dubai to find a gas_station ... bad start thx to dollar_rent a car !!!
neutral	!
neutral	le_prix du transport assez élevé et_la pub faite autour de_l ' envoi en 00h00 si avant 00h00 n ' a pas été respecté .
neutral	( attente d ' une semaine !)
neutral	je pense a un problème de fin d ' approvisionnement ( méthode rose piano ) à une période ou tout le monde la veut mais mis a par ce souci si c ' est celui ci que_je comprendrai , aucune information concrète concernant le retard .
neutral	mis a part ça je pense que woodbrass est_très sérieux tant au niveau qualité de matériel qu ' en conseils .
neutral	relais kiala serai un plus et_en cas de retard , des mails indiquant pourquoi un retard serai très apprécié .
neutral	furniture arrived .
neutral	the delivery men brought four heavy pieces into the house and informed me that they didn_'_t unpack and move the units into place .
neutral	i had four very large cartons ful of plastic_wrapping and loads of polystyrene to move and dispose of to say nothing of moving the units into their final position .
neutral	as they too heavy for me to shift being a pensioner i had to have help , and then i had to make two trips to the tip with the packages .
neutral	surely some means of giving the customer the help they need can be found .
neutral	the furniture scores 00 pts .
neutral	customer service 0pts .
neutral	elf and safety gone mad .
neutral	the roman_blinds themselves are really nice .
neutral	however the catches seem to be really flimsy and difficult to operate as they don_'_t seem to hold .
neutral	apart_from that very pleased .
neutral	ordered the phone through_topcashback website and was told i would receive a cash_back reward .
neutral	however after accepting the phone i received an email from topcashback informing_me that mpd had declined the cash_back .
neutral	this was without explanation and tcb couldn_'_t offer further explanation without looking into it . which they will .
neutral	shame as everything else went well but feel a little let_down by this as this cash_back offer enabled_me to pay off existing contract .
neutral	now i '_m left with 0 bills .
neutral	i hope that this will get resolved as it will leave a sour feeling with dealing_with both tcb and mpd .
neutral	update :- i was contacted by mpd shortly_after leaving this review apologising for the mistake and that the cashback would get paid to me straight_away .
neutral	it has now been over 0_weeks and still the payment has not been paid .
neutral	it seems as though they do act on negative_feedback but do not follow through with the necessary actions to rectify the situation .
neutral	just when i thought the issue had been resolved , it seems as though mpd have snatched defeat from the jaws of victory !
neutral	ridiculous packaging and postage_charges for a thin accounts ledger .
neutral	amazing service - item ordered saturday and arrived monday .
neutral	really pleased
neutral	flowers bought for valentines .
neutral	expected a bigger_bunch for the price and frankly could have bought two bigger bunches for the same price .
neutral	it would have been helpful if the size could be mentioned on the website .
neutral	also wasn_'_t expecting the flowers to be artifically dyed .
neutral	this too could have been made clear on the website .
neutral	ive been with littlewoods for a fair few_years_now and in general i have never had any huge problems , products have always been of good quality , delivery has always been good and any e_mail enquiries i have made have always been answered pretty quick .
neutral	however i have had an issue with false_advertising and not recieving all the products i ordered as part of a set which i couldnt return because it was opened and after a few e_mails back and forth trying to get what i ordered they just started ignoring them .
neutral	obviously not too impressed with that which is why i have decided to start paying my account off and shutting it down hopefully by xmas .
neutral	as another_reviewer said they are overpriced and your credit_limit does go up extremely quick , mine was recently at 00k .
neutral	they are convenient as a short_term fix if you need something quick and are light on funds but dont get out of your depth .
neutral	also if your paying on bnpl on credit terms make_sure its paid off before you have to start paying for it ....... you '_ll pay almost double if not more in some cases .
neutral	example £_000 washing_machine + £_000 interest
neutral	ordered a new cooker , on line , on a sunday_afternoon .
neutral	i was surprised to see that the following_day , monday , was an option for delivery .
neutral	as our existing cooker was not working i was more than happy to have it delivered next_day .
neutral	on the monday i phoned to check the delivery time .
neutral	i was told that owing to a technical issue it was not going to be delivered that day .
neutral	we agreed another day and told that we would need to phone the day before to get a time window for delivery .
neutral	we made the call and where told between 00 . 00 am and 0 . 00pm , with the driver calling half an_hour before delivery .
neutral	at 0pm we hadn_'_t heard from the driver so i called fires - cookers .
neutral	i was told the times we were given were only an estimate .
neutral	the driver did call and arrived about 0 . 00 pm , better late than never .
neutral	slow for this day and age and the merchandise was left_outside in the rain .
neutral	fortunately , it was made of plastic but i had to brush off and fish - out the critters that used it for refuge .
neutral	the merchandise was not quite as expected so more information on their website would have been helpful .
neutral	please add much clearer information on roll - up fees for short_stay car_park .
neutral	after making phone enquiries it would be cheaper to pay roll - up charges up to 00_hours of parking than pre_- book .
neutral	this is not very clear on website .
neutral	i have rated many companies over many_years , and i have never rated one as low as i have rated guitarguitar .
neutral	i ordered a new guitar from them and , on delivery , found that the instrument was not only an ex - demonstrator , it was in an awful condition .
neutral	this was completely_unacceptable to me and the guitar was more like a second_hand instrument .
neutral	guitarguitar agreed to take the guitar back at there expense , but on asking if the other guitars of the same model were new or ex - demonstrators , they informed me that they were all ex - demonstrators .
neutral	i complained about this , and they assured me that they would all be updated as ex - demonstrators on their web_site .
neutral	although they agreed to exchange the guitar for a different model , and i thank them for this , i have since checked their web_site and the promised changes have never been done .
neutral	i can '_t say that i am in any way happy with this as i have been playing and buying guitars for over 00 years and have never had this situation come up before .
neutral	all i will say , is " buyer_beware ."
neutral	the cover looked ok for the price , but when the policy_document arrived we discovered that because of my age ( 00 ), the period covered was reduced from 00 days to 00 days .
neutral	we had to cancel the policy and get a refund .
neutral	at_least the refund was paid promptly .
neutral	i made a booking yesterday from hull to rotterdam , returning the following_day from dunkerque to dover .
neutral	because i was busy and in a rush i mistakenly booked a 0 . 00am crossing from dunkerque instead of a 0 . 00pm crossing .
neutral	i immediately realised this on receipt of the confirmation and immediately rang ferrysavers to explain mistake , the lady was very understanding , but after a phone_call , she changed the booking but charged me £_00
neutral	i suspect the original booking had not been placed on the system so the £_00 was unreasonable
neutral	bought the leggings for my wife '_s birthday .
neutral	she_likes the style and colours ; but really and truthfully the material is far too thin .
neutral	she says they are more like tights .
neutral	so i can '_t i '_m afraid give them a great write up , only an average one this time .
neutral	she_loves the gold capped shoes though .
neutral	slightly_disappointed in that having waited 00 weeks for delivery of our lounge suite and dining_table to find that one of the chairs was missing the feet , which now means we have to wait another 0 - 0_weeks for delivery of these items so we can use the chair .
neutral	ordered a breaker and e_mailed them asking if it could be sent asap .
neutral	didnt receive a reply to my e_mail but waited 0 days before i called them asking if it had been dispatched , their order system says something about an advisory e_mail on dispatch which arrived ten_minutes after i called .
neutral	i received my breaker 00 days after i ordered it .
neutral	in the meantime i had to hire one as mine was beyond_repair .
neutral	it would have been cheaper for me to buy local and collect same day as the saving was less_than the hire cost .
neutral	why did it take 00 days ?
neutral	dont_think i will use them again
neutral	chris ross
neutral	i '_ve_used you before and been pleased with both the product and service .
neutral	this time around the service was good but the product disappointing .
neutral	i ordered the south_african protea bunch of flowers and then upgraded it to the top bunch of flowers .
neutral	what arrived was a small bunch of flowers which i could quite readily have got from somewhere like marks & spencers for £_00_-£_00 .
neutral	i would have been better doing that rather_than spending a not insignificant sum for a product that i could have quite easily got for £_00_-£_00 .
neutral	well i spent some time getting prices for my items and packing them up .
neutral	i chose a delivery slot and indeed music_magpie were good enough to sent reminders about my collection date .
neutral	and so on the agreed date i waited ... and waited ... and waited ... for over 00_hours but no courier , no communication , absolutely zilch .
neutral	i have better things to do than wait around all day for a ' no show '.
neutral	i '_ve since attempted to get a re - scheduled collection date and hopefully things will go well but my first impression of music_magpie isn_'_t very good .
neutral	if my stuff is collected i will gladly post positive_feedback .
neutral	the courier arrived the following_day - 00_hours late !
neutral	as luck would have it i was at home and my parcel was collected without_any problem .
neutral	i have updated the review to three stars .
neutral	i really do like boden '_s clothing for men - it '_s well made and stylish to boot .
neutral	but almost every time i go on the website looking for stuff , it '_s out of stock !
neutral	if i stick to making a purchase i usually have weeks to wait for delivery .
neutral	so , often as not , i amble down the high_streets instead , and get decent stuff right away .
neutral	i ' d buy a lot more from boden if they kept their stock up a good deal more .
neutral	it works ok when you figure how to load it up .
neutral	that is if you can find a magnifying_glass to read the instructions that come with it .
neutral	if your not good with setting_up things without full instructions forget it ..
neutral	but i must_say it is keeping my wife happy watching_tv abroad .
neutral	but you must load a vpn ..
neutral	i approached slater & gordon to help with a work related issue and was put off them when i was told that one of their representatives would call me back at precisely 0 :_00pm on january 00th 0000 to discuss my issue .
neutral	a representative did not contact me at the agreed time nor at all that day .
neutral	subsequently they contacted me the next_day and their assistance was very helpful at that point .
neutral	i ordered from them a little while ago , it was my first order so it was a big one , and thought i might switch from myprotein , and also become an affiliate since i run a personal training studio .
neutral	however what i didn_'_t know when placing my order was they ' d cut_corners when choosing a delivery company and instead of hiring a reputable firm , went with yodel .
neutral	in true yodel form , on the day it was supposed to be delivered , it wasn_'_t .
neutral	i got an email_saying the delivery driver marked it as " got no answer " when in truth , ( as we found out later ) they ' d sent it out from the wrong depot to the wrong driver , and it didn_'_t even make it within 000_miles of my place .
neutral	( literally !)
neutral	however , dave in customer service was amazing !
neutral	he kept on yodel '_s back , kept me informed by email and phone .
neutral	i really can '_t fault them for their customer service .
neutral	they do really treat you like a vip and i was incredibly impressed by how this was handled .
neutral	the reason i only gave them 0_stars though is because , it doesn_'_t mater how great your products are , and your back end service is if you have trouble actually getting the product into your hands !
neutral	if you take out the delivery , they ' re easily a 0_star company .
neutral	i fact i ' d go as far as to say 0 out of 0 !
neutral	it '_s just unfortunate that every time you order it '_s a crap - shoot as to when ( or knowing yodel '_s reputation , if at all !)
neutral	you '_ll get your hands on what you ordered .
neutral	will i order again ?
neutral	i '_m undecided right now .
neutral	after having to wait in two_days on the trot last time , i '_m still weighing up whether the products are worth the stress , or if i should just go back to myprotein and have done with it .
neutral	i '_ve got a couple of weeks of supplements to get through , so time will tell .
neutral	watch this space !
neutral	before i say all the below i just want to say i love the ja store and there clothes but they need to sort some stuff out that '_s why i '_m writing this .
neutral	after my recent order " s " ( i exaggerate the '_s ' because it has occurred twice_now , in a row ) i have not received the confirmation order email which they promise to not only tell you the order has_been placed but also to include a receipt copy .
neutral	nether time have i received this valuable email .
neutral	to add even when i called the store by phone i was told an email would be sent out and no email was delivered .
neutral	brilliant selection , although there is plenty more eclective music out there that you should stock !
neutral	website is easy to get around and like all the reminder and follow features .
neutral	can be slightly on the higher price rate for vinyl and for that price you would expect the products to come in good nic !
neutral	too many_times have i had warped , scratched or in somewhat someway damaged vinyl .
neutral	thats really my only_concern , and also ...
neutral	... us vinyl junkies like paper and card_sleeves for every record !!
neutral	!
neutral	other than that , fair_play to you juno !
neutral	how the air staff managed is a miracle
neutral	to aussie wow
neutral	from aussie to dubie wow
neutral	from dubia to birmingham and mancherster with some of the passengers
neutral	no thanks
neutral	no bad things to say
neutral	we booked a chevrolet_aveo but were given a fiat_panda which was rather small .
neutral	used to because the portion_sizes are shrinking , but the meal prices are increasing .
neutral	nevertheless , still amazing food
neutral	good but a bit_pricey and delivery wasn_'_t rapid .
neutral	order clothes that came very quick ( ordered on sunday they came tuesday ).
neutral	one item was missing ... when i put the order in it said low stock ... and the item did not arrive , so i worked out they didn_'_t send it and lucky refunded me for the item without having to ask .
neutral	failed to inform_me that they were not going to send that one item .
neutral	i will use them again .
neutral	good website .
neutral	i ordered an item on 00 dec , but it was not delivered until 00 jan .
neutral	i think that the item was not in stock , but this was not apparent when i made the order .
neutral	i emailed the company , but i got no reply .
neutral	a few_days_later i phoned the company , and i was told that i would receive an update on the status of my order , but no such update was issued .
neutral	i feared the worst and was about to cancel the order when suddenly a dispatch notice arrived in my inbox .
neutral	the delivery company ( dpd ) was better_than most .
neutral	the parcel arrived within a one - hour delivery slot .
neutral	not all items delivered , customer_sevices slow takes 00_mins to get to talk to anybody .
neutral	good service when ordering the products in store .
neutral	delivery drivers moaning_about taking items upstairs this was promised in store they would delivery straight to the room .
neutral	products very good .
neutral	some parts missing but got on to helpline and they sorted it straight_away .
neutral	if some of these points could be improved it be be and excellent service
neutral	i should start by saying that the laptop i ordered , was itself fantastic and in perfect working order .
neutral	however , for a 0 - 0 day build , it took 00 days for me to receive it , over twice the expected when you factor in shipping .
neutral	on top of the late delivery , the mouse i ordered was not included nor was any explanation as to why it wasn_'_t included , i was forced to call their support_team myself and enquire , only to be told that they were awaiting stock and then that the mouse i had ordered had been_discontinued .
neutral	arrangements should have been made to inform_me that this was the case .
neutral	that being said , the people themselves were very pleasant and not at all defensive .
neutral	the matter was resolved swiftly and with no_hassle , although i did have to wait for a while before my call was answered .
neutral	haivng had two parcels from amazon recently dropped over the back fence , the second lanfding in the snow and being left for the weekend by initial review would be much_lower .
neutral	( amazon replaced the damaged goods without_any fuss - proves how cheap hdnl must be !)
neutral	however since my partner caught one of the drivers and had a discussion they have since started leaving our parcels with neighbours .
neutral	i aplaude the thinking that leaving the parcel in a secure place would be helpful and they didn_'_t leave it in plain sight , but sadly this was let_down by the fact they could no see over the fence and obviously had no consideration for the contents of the parcels .
neutral	whilst they continue to undercut the post_office amazon will still be using them so the problems will_continue .
neutral	my advice - help the drivers apply some common_sense and ask for parcels to be left with a neighbour .
neutral	ordered by phone , delivery arrived very promptly , my universal / ioa tickets were what i expected , real tickets .
neutral	i was disappointed to find that my seaworld 0 park 00 day bundle was in fact a printed sheet of a0 paper with a barcode .
neutral	i was expecting real tickets similar to my uv / ioa ones .
neutral	i felt misled upon_receipt of these .
neutral	it says in the t &_c that tickets sent in the uk would be real tickets , on phoning to enquire , i was informed that they are gate ready tickets , and can be used as such at the turnstile .
neutral	not the same , in my book , felt let_down in this regard .
neutral	delivered quickly but marks on the cajon make me think this has already been used .
neutral	scuff_marks and a red mark on side - where did that come from .
neutral	i always use this site for my base priceline and then shop around .
neutral	if i can find it at the same price elesewhere , i always use that because of the appalling returns_policy .
neutral	i have to return a cd because it wouldn ; t play the last track , and the amount of money i was allowed to spend on the return was 00p less_than the post_office price .
neutral	now , i know 00p isn_'_t much , but the principal is huge - amazon dictated an internal price that was not offered by the cheapest vendor in the are - the post_office .
neutral	liked the product .
neutral	ordered x 0 of the same product .
neutral	cant se why i should pay for delivery twice when its coming in the same order and packed .
neutral	thats trying to fool me and taking the micky .
neutral	i hate being_ripped_off even for a pound .
neutral	it '_s about the principle !
neutral	would not buy again if i have to pay twice for delivery again .
neutral	thanks
neutral	everything completed but confirming payment returned me to home page . customer service wanted to charge £_00 extra for same ticket which i eventually bought for £ 0 extra the next_day .
neutral	i have never had a really bad_experience .
neutral	however i only rated 0_stars because of the prices .
neutral	they just aren_'_t competitive and they dont seem to have a wide_variety in each section sticking with brands rather_than customers choice / variety .
neutral	to be honest i buy my strings and picks from you guys as i feel i get a good price , anything_else i buy is because other online stores are out of stock
neutral	i booked online for the monday as i had no plans only to be called two_days_later and told they had no fitters available as they gave them 0 days off for a 0 day bank_holiday i asked why the date was avail and they said the date was available for the uk and not location based offered me 00 quid to say sorry which still_haven_'_t received will not be using again
neutral	website not bad .
neutral	it would be great if all of your buses had a live narrator .
neutral	this is the second time that i have ordered hard_disks from pixmania .
neutral	both_times the packing has_been completely inadequate .
neutral	both_times the hard_disk was floating about loose in the packing box .
neutral	amazingly both disks seem to be working o . k .
neutral	surely the dispatcher should realise that these are relatively sensitive pieces of electronics and require to be packed adequately .
neutral	good value but delivery slow , had to contact to find out where my item was
neutral	homebase website had a deal on a pressure_washer at a competitive price .
neutral	good .
neutral	item could not be collected from a store .
neutral	bad
neutral	ordering on homebase website was straight_forward .
neutral	good
neutral	delivery time was between 00 . 00 and 00 . 00 .
neutral	ridiculous and unacceptable .
neutral	cheap delivery firm i suppose to reduce costs .
neutral	folly on the part of homebase though because that will be my abiding memory of this experience .
neutral	other delivery companies tell me to the minute when they will be at my door and they are accurate .
neutral	i will happily pay a little extra rather_than endure such inefficient service .
neutral	communication was good and delivery was fast but the product quality was a let_down .
neutral	we have had a few problems with deliveries with interparcel but have to say it '_s not interparcel them self '_s but one of the company '_s they used which was yodel out of 00 bikes delivered one was damaged badly one has_been lost altogether and about 0 of the cartons was damaged when our customs received them .
neutral	i have noticed that yodel are no_longer an option with interparcel so it seems that they must of had a lot of complaints for interparcel not to be using them any more which is a good thing .
neutral	i now use city_link through interparcel and am getting a better service and the driver that collects form me is very good and takes care with the parcels and i have had no_complaints from my customers with the condition they arrive in
neutral	when you book via a wesite like arguscarhire , you usually get a competitive rate but the car_hire company locally are usually looking for ways to get money out of you .
neutral	one common way is the ' full_tank ' of fuel out and empty back .
neutral	for the car i had , a full_tank from empty costs 00_euros , but the charge was 00_euros from europe car .
neutral	also , inevitably , you do not return the car empty .
neutral	extra drivers are 0 euros plus_vat per day and unless you take their very expensive waiver_insurance , the a deposit of 000_euros is reserved on your credit_card etc , etc .
neutral	so beware , it may not be as cheap as you think !
neutral	such a small tube of 0 % hyrdrocortisone cream was put in a huge box for postage .
neutral	the cost of postage negated any savings from the normal prescription cost of £ 0 . 00 .
neutral	prompt delivery though .
neutral	the product took over 0 days to reach me .
neutral	i have used you before and you are good on price but this delay in delivery would prevent my continued use .
neutral	00p for postage when i print it out myself ?
neutral	easy to use and understand but surely your costs are included in the ticket handling_fee to chrage postage on top is a bit_annoying .
neutral	the description does not contain a size , which does make it difficult to know if you have ordered the correct parts .
neutral	in my case they were the wrong_size .
neutral	however , all credit to bigdug they accepted the return and credited my account without_any inquisition - top_marks .
neutral	have traded with j lewis for over 00 years as their service was second to none .
neutral	sadly that is no_longer the case , they now have a central call_centre which is very frustrating to use at best , bordering on intolerable at worst .
neutral	when it was possible to speak to stores direct and departments within the store , information was reliable now , the call_centre staffing is so poor that i have chosen to shop elsewhere as information given to me is both inaccurate and lacking in expertise .
neutral	i have been told that items are not stocked however , when visiting stores found those items are available to buy and they have never been unavailable .
neutral	perhaps j lewis is resting on it '_s laurels , that can '_t last_forever !
neutral	the delivery was faster_than i anticipated .
neutral	the price was very competitive .
neutral	an easy to use website that had plenty of detail about the different tyres that national_tyres stocked .
neutral	i ordered the tyres and booked the car in to have them fitted .
neutral	all worked_seamlessly with the tyres being delivered , ready for fitting when i arrived .
neutral	overall i got good money for my phone and the turnaround was quick as promised , but watch out for the small_print .
neutral	the site says they send you a freepost paid bag , but this is just a plastic_envelope .
neutral	you are expected to provide suitable packaging - which is quite important as if the phone is damaged in transit it will seriously affect how much you receive .
neutral	the packing instructions you receive with the envelope say that basic insurance ( up to £_00 ) is included in the service and that you should consider paying extra to get more insurance but when i went to the post_office they confirmed that the pre_- pay category included no insurance and you have to pay extra if you want any .
neutral	the car_rental experience was a three way split .
neutral	good car , slow at desk due to person in front not being prepared nor accepting initially the fuel_policy and wishing to argue with attendant .
neutral	only one member of staff dealing_with airside queue .
neutral	fuel_policy .
neutral	full_tank at 000_euros is expensive .
neutral	what is wrong with giving a full_tank and return full ?
neutral	the pressure to take higher insurance premium is not necessary and is time_consuming , it is accepted that people should understand what they are getting .
neutral	no one available in car_park for returns .
neutral	keys left in letter_box .
neutral	quick and trustworthy !
neutral	the service on arrival was quick but on return there was no thank_you from the assistant who had a grumpy face .
neutral	this is the second time i have used this company .
neutral	on both_occasions i have been disappointed with their vehicles . l sat year the vehicle was damaged and marked at the rear , this year the vehicle was badly marked all over with dents and scrapes .
neutral	all the tyre_pressures were low and i to inflate each tyre .
neutral	the rear_offside tyre had a slow_puncture and had to be inflated every 0days .
neutral	i was not able to track my order as no tracking code sent and the track my order link just sends you to the home page .
neutral	left sheffield florist at 00 : 00 , but did not arrive until after 00 : 00 in sheffield .
neutral	i know there are other orders to deliver but if it is going to take all day then a second_batch should be sent out .
neutral	this time my need was to find an e_- shop selling 0 . 00 products with full size range and wiggle had available my size 00 , 0 by ordering in 0 - 0_weeks .
neutral	after 0_weeks i contacted ' em for informations and told me my shoes were not available suggesting size 00 .
neutral	i confirmed order with bigger_size and now i '_m using them with satisfaction after sole modification .
neutral	all is ok with speed delivery but wasn_'_t the right one !
neutral	good service and speed
neutral	the product box had been opened previously and i think someone pinched a bit out of it .
neutral	the retaining clip on the rotary joint .
neutral	i have made up a piece to fix the problem as i did not want the hassle of returning .
neutral	goods are great but communication poor
neutral	ali went very well until we got back and found that the rear number_plate to the car had come off ( somehow ??)
neutral	could not be sure of some slight_scratches to the rear_bumper and when asked why they hadn_'_t re fitted the number_plate got no reply ???
neutral	the only attendant left the car_park in the mini_bus .???
neutral	still none the wiser as to how it happened or why it was not replaced .......
neutral	oh_yeah , the head rest on my seat ( was raised up very high ?)
neutral	wonder_if the person parking it was really tall and had a bit of a sleep in it ??
neutral	? too many strange goings on for me .
neutral	would recomend that you take your milage reading and ensure that the car is inspected thoroughly before you leave it .
neutral	it could all be coincidence , but lesson_learned for me
neutral	the 0 items in question are the st . george cross bow_tie (( btpnm00dp000r ) & the union_flag waistcoat ( wcofm00dp000r ).
neutral	as to the former , there is perhaps a national flag featuring a maroon / wine / burgundy cross but it '_s not the english st . george .
neutral	the colour doesn_'_t even match the waistcoat & couldn_'_t be worn together as intended without its seeming quite incongruous .
neutral	i '_ve sought a refund on this .
neutral	regarding the latter , the waistcoat pockets are crumpled / rouched & very badly finished ; it '_s hard to see how they may have passed any sighted , quality control .
neutral	i '_ve sought an exchange in hope that the one i received is an_isolated example .
neutral	item delivered quickly but having gone_through_topcashback still no sign of cashback .
neutral	this is the second time this has happened .
neutral	good travel_insurance except it would be better if the online quote gave you the admin_fee as well , apart_from that great .
neutral	when you book , you don_'_t clear_instructions of what happens when you get there .
neutral	you have to ' take a ticket '.
neutral	on the ticket are your details , no explanation of this is given when you book , annd it would help if they just said , take the ticket and as you '_ve already pre_paid just put it in the machine when you leave .
neutral	there is absolutely no one anywhere to ask for help or advice .
neutral	apart_from that , good carpark , frequent_buses back and to the terminal .
neutral	ramps are really good quality , but too heavy to carry both at once .
neutral	i didn_'_t like the constant reminder to check the ramps before signing for them or i woul be responsible if they were damaged in transit .
neutral	no - one else has ever asked me to do that .
neutral	in the end they came in a plastic_bag in a cardboard_box & the end of the cardbox box had broken open .
neutral	the ramps were fine though .
neutral	the packaging is inadequate for such a heavy item .
neutral	a delivery slot of 0000 - 0000 isn_'_t exactly helpful either .
neutral	on the plus_side they were helpful when i asked a question before buying .
neutral	i tried to take_advantage of the 00_%_discount offer for a return crossing dover to calais only to discover that the price quoted was the same as dfds was quoting on its own website anyway .
neutral	when i phoned direct_ferries i found that , unlike_other travel companies , the telephones are not manned on a sunday .
neutral	i received all of the goods i ordered very quickly given that they were shipped to ireland .
neutral	they seem to be of excellent quality although i haven_'_t used them all yet .
neutral	unfortunately one of the products - 0 litres of chassis cleaner - leaked during_transit .
neutral	the container did not burst_open due to an impact but rather it simply leaked through an inadequate screw on cap .
neutral	the result was that i lost approx 00_% of the contents of the cleaning_fluid which spilled all over the rest of the items in the consignment making them all soggy and destroying all of their cardboard packaging and any instruction leaflets .
neutral	it was a mess that could have been avoided if the containers used were properly sealed before shipping .
neutral	great price for hitman absolution professional edition with , apparently , the sniper challenge code put in to your shopto . net account .
neutral	received the package very rapidly and , per instructions , went to my newly created account to obtain the promised code but alas , no code .
neutral	i could be missing something here when i look at all the account option boxes but i swear there '_s nothing there that looks remotely like a code .
neutral	maybe it '_s because it '_s inbetween xmas and new year so i '_ll just have to wait_until , maybe , the code is sent in the new year !!
neutral	very dissapointing as the free inclusion of the sniper challenge is what made me go for this offer in the first place .
neutral	follow_up as of today , new year '_s eve - rang them and received the code in my account .
neutral	no problem , so five_stars for a prompt service !
neutral	ordered product which was showing in stock .
neutral	paid for next_day delivery as wanted it fast .
neutral	0 days after order i got an email to say they ' d run out and i could either cancel or wait .
neutral	i opted to wait .
neutral	not the end of the world but on this occasion , less impressive service than other_reviewers seem to have experienced .
positive	i have no_hesitation in recommending this company .
positive	all - in - all a pleasant shopping_experience .
positive	i ordered a drill as a last_minute xmas_present , rang up to check the order was in stock and it arrived the next_day plus the postage was free !
positive	what more could ask for ?
positive	oh_yes , there were cheaper_than anyone_else by far !
positive	order was shipped same day and received the next plus there were no postage_charges !
positive	excellent service good price these batteries are cheaper_than when i last looked .
positive	first_class service .
positive	i had to get some parts urgently , phoned total and there they were the next_day .
positive	no need to waste time on - line as the prices were competitive too .
positive	delivered on time by helpful delivery guys
positive	this is the 0st time i have used an online website to purchase prescriptions and found it to be trouble_free with a fast service as our prescriptions turned_up within two_days .
positive	highly_recommended and will_definitely use again .
positive	led self_adhesive tape lights , power_supplies and cables / connectors .
positive	these items ( 0 sets ) were custom made to exact length at no extra_cost , they were well_packed and promptly dispatched and once fitted worked a treat .

positive	highly_recommended .

positive	i ordered a hercules guitar stand to use for my mandolin - the order was dealt_with swiftly , and the courier company , dpd , were excellent in making repeated_attempts to catch me in to deliver it .
positive	the stand is very good - sturdy , compact and fits the instrument well .
positive	i '_ve use kingston_blinds twice , my order was delivered quickly , and the product was great quality - 000_% satisfied
positive	i was very impressed firstly with the price of the product i wanted and the way the whole order was handled .
positive	an email alerted me that my order would be delivered between 00 . 00 and 00 . 00 on friday and the delivery guy knocked on the door at 00 . 00 .
positive	great service and i would certainly recommend go - electrical based on my experience .
positive	not the first time that i have used these_guys .
positive	normally competitive and always delivered on time .
positive	easy to navigate site and excellent value for money .
positive	delivery was very quick too .
positive	thank_you .
positive	absolutely perfect .
positive	it took about 0 minutes to book and pay for the tyres , about 00 seconds for a confirmation call from a nice lady and then the van turned_up the next_day as agreed to fit them .
positive	all - in - all a total pleasure .
positive	( and he didn_'_t even fit the wrong tyres like another ' national ' tyre company did last_year .)
positive	the actuators i ordered arrived a couple of days_later .
positive	i '_ll be back for more bits very soon .
positive	i placed my order friday_afternoon and was amazed when a parcel arrived first thing saturday_morning .
positive	i have ordered led_gu00 lamps online before at a similar price , but they took a week to arrive and were definitely much_lower quality .
positive	the lightrabbit bulbs are heavy , metal and glass construction and very nice .
positive	i '_ll be back for some more very soon .
positive	i used the mobile fitting service and the technician called to agree the time of the installation and arrived when he said he would .
positive	customer experiance was first_rate and i will used blackcircles again !
positive	i always like to hear from a company requesting_feedback - it shows they care about their customers .
positive	item bought very quick delivery , thank_you !!

positive	a verey easy experiance all_round
positive	used many_times ... no issues at all
positive	good delivery and easy to install
positive	the lights look great in the garden
positive	there '_s no need to say any more than the kit was competitively_priced and arrived when they said it would .
positive	i found this company online and decided to test them with a request for an iphone back cover .
positive	it arrived the next_day .
positive	i then sent them an iphone_0s for a power_button repair .
positive	i sent it to them on thursday , and it was back with me on saturday_morning fully repaired .

positive	i was looking for specifically glucosamine which is from natural vegetarian source , i found that it is synthetically prepared as well as from shell fish .
positive	when i order it from natures_best i was under impression it is from synthetic source and not from shell fish , because my mom is vegetarian .
positive	anyways i dont have any complain .
positive	all ordered products arrived together within a few_days of ordering , they were well_packed and undamaged .
positive	overall , great service .
positive	elegant website .
positive	simple ordering system and super_fast delivery .
positive	what more could you ask for ?
positive	i bought a mackie big knob studio command system from music_matters , and they are amazing .
positive	with the price that i got this item for , from them i thought their service would be an inevitable downside .
positive	not at all .
positive	courteous , friendly communications .
positive	fast delivery even over the christmas_period .

positive	our new hotpoint_washing_machine was supplied at the right price - cheaper_than amazon & ebay & john_lewis .
positive	it was delivered right on time - they gave_us a 00 minute window so we didn_'_t have to wait in all day .
positive	it was carefully installed and tested by two marks_electrical engineers , and they took away the old machine .
positive	total time between our trusty 00 year hotpoint finally giving up the ghost to new ultima washing our family '_s clothes was about 00_hours ...

positive	a bargain , jump in board and get one yourself
positive	clear and easy process with excellent and simple tracking process .
positive	goods ordered late_afternoon , and delivered by royal_mail at lunchtime next_day , even after selecting 00 hour delivery option .

positive	i had a client whom i wished to thank who was located in germany .
positive	eflowers found this no problem and delivered the very next_day .
positive	my client was thrilled and i was very pleased to have been able to give them a personal thank_you .

positive	an awesome shop and merlin makes everything so easy
positive	great service and good delivery and great stuff
positive	great service , quick delivery
positive	made everything so easy no problem at all
positive	i used this site initially as it was one of the cheapest for what i wanted .
positive	when my items arrived one melamine plate of a set for 0 people ( by set i mean cups , bowls and plates ) had been damaged in transit .
positive	i e_- mailed ( wed_night ) them and got a response thursday_morning saying they would sent a complete new set for 0 asking when would be convient to have the delivery .
positive	couriers aren_'_t always gentle , so really can '_t fault owd for their service .
positive	thanks !
positive	the items were just as advertised and a very good price they also arrived very quickly .
positive	i will be looking there again when i require some more glasses etc .
positive	it was just so easy and completed in a few_days from the time of going on the site to getting the cheque . i would certainly deal with them again .
positive	i was able to go the website and find the part i required fairly easily . i ordered and paid on line and in a couple of days the required part arrived - no_hassle .
positive	competitive_pricing drew us to wicken for a great plum product . wicken_toys rang the day before to advise us of the delivery as promised . the product is of a superior design and took my son and i 0 hours to put it up . my grandaughter aged 0 has had thetime of her young life playing on her swing / slide . the free baby_seat that came with the set is a great addition .
positive	my order was received without_delay in excellent condition .
positive	ordered a pair of oakley_radar sunglasses at 0 :_00pm on friday and arrived before 00am the next_day .
positive	ordered between christmas and the new year too .
positive	what more can i say , excellent service and delivery , wouldn_'_t hesitate to use cyclestore again .
positive	this is the second time i '_ve_used mazuma , like the first time it was a quick and painless_transaction .
positive	highly_recommended to all .
positive	don_'_t bother with the rest , stick with the best .
positive	many_thanks ( again ) mazuma :)
positive	in the past i '_ve always gone with various manufacturers laptops but could never get one with the specs i want until i discovered pc_specialist .
positive	i ordered a optimus 0 laptop with exactly the spec i wanted but none of the usual fluff ( i had my own copy of windows , security software and didn_'_t want a dvd_drive )
positive	the turnaround from ordering to appearing at my door was 0 days .
positive	i '_ve been using the laptop for around 0_weeks now and have upgraded the ram and swapped one of the harddisks for an ssd ( pc_specialist maintain the warranty too with user installed upgrades ).
positive	the laptop runs warm whilst gaming so a cooling pad is recommended .
positive	overall a good experience and will_definately buy my my next laptop from pc_specialist .
positive	the store was well_laid_out and the staff knowledgeable .
positive	in choosing a range , for our purposes , slight_problem with sizes and choice .
positive	info .
positive	about arrival was excellent including from call from delivery men .
positive	they were very helpful .
positive	the product is excellent , very happy with our purchase .
positive	it does what it says !
positive	the process was easy and very comfortable ; the ease of selling my mobile was fantastic .
positive	couldn_'_t have been a more pleasureable_experience !!
positive	!
positive	the transaction was smooth - from the initial order via the website to the delivery , which arrived as promised .
positive	the delivery men were friendly and helpful .
positive	the quality of the worktop is excellent .
positive	the tops are smooth and the wood looks great .
positive	my online retail experience is fairly limited to amazon and ebay .
positive	so it gave_me a lot of confidence to see that worktop_express was a highly - rated ebay_seller .
positive	satisfaction levels were very good .
positive	and i always say , " you don_'_t buy the thing , you buy the seller ."
positive	nonetheless , i made my order via the worktop_express website because it was easier to use than ebay .
positive	for some reason , ebay wanted to charge two delivery charges - one for the worktops and one for the danish_oil - despite making the purchases in one order .
positive	the worktop_express site gave a lot of good information about different woods and how to care for them .
positive	i bought the danish_oil without having done any research_into it .
positive	it just seemed that worktop_express knew what they were talking_about !
positive	the price of the worktops is very competitive , and i think this swung me in favour of wood , rather_than a man - made surface - and also our previous experience of having a laminate - style worktop .
positive	after 0 years our old worktop was starting to look tired and worn .
positive	overall , i am very happy with this purchase
positive	very quick service and all received in perfect order
positive	it was quick and easy
positive	i knew what style of radiator valve i wanted for our new slim line radiators , this was the only place that hade an_alternative to the big plastic standard parts , or very cheap unbranded parts with quality issues .
positive	i was very pleased with the service , the right price and my new psu arrived within_00hours
positive	cms online '_s exploded views of my bike makes choosing the correct_part easy .
positive	the ordering system is a doddle and the parts arrive promptly and are very well_packaged .
positive	a +
positive	i have used this company a couple of times and will use it more in future .
positive	excellent pricing and very speedy delivery , with great communication .
positive	no_complaints whatsoever .
positive	blinds arrived quickly in a very long tube !
positive	each blind fitted the recess perfectly and was easy to put up .
positive	they look great ..
positive	thanks !
positive	excellent service and adaptation to changes to delivery requirements , having to cope with us not being available at the delivery time .
positive	would use them again , no_problems with delivery and great prices too
positive	i '_ve_used mazuma 0 times and it '_s always been quick and painless .
positive	i ordered the 000_% whey_protein lemon_shortcake flavour which is very nice .
positive	i also chose to have it delivered within 0 - 0 days and got it the next_day i ordered which was fantastic !
positive	i have been using supplementwarehouse . com for a number of years_now .

positive	tyre_shopper website was great and the price for the tyres was good too .
positive	i opted for the fitted service and your office even gave_me a courtesy_call to say the fitters ( national_tyres in aylesbury ) had 0 in stock but the other 0 were due to be delivered the morning of the fitting so best to phone them to make_sure they had arrived .
positive	good advice as it turned_out and saved me a wasted_journey since the tyres didn_'_t arrive_till about 00 . 00am .
positive	so , very pleased with the service from tyre_shopper - unfortunately less pleased with service from the fitters .
positive	checked their paperwork when i got back home and it said they had inflated tyres to 00 psi front and back - thought that was odd should they should be 00 psi front and 00 psi rear ( not hard since manufacturer '_s label with correct pressures is inside the driver '_s door ).
positive	when i actually checked the pressures i found they had put 00 psi in both front and , wait for it , 00 psi in both back wheels !!
positive	that '_s 00_% more than ford '_s recommended pressure of 00 psi for the rear_tyres so not too clever .
positive	i had also had them reset the tracking since they told me it was a couple of degrees out - i just hope they did a better job with that since i can '_t double_check it myself .
positive	can recommend this firm
positive	i love the blog on this site as well as the range of spirits , wines and champagnes .

positive	had my renault_megane 0 . 0 dci oil and filter changed .
positive	priced the oil and filter on google_shopping and it cost approx_£_00 .
positive	national_tyres did the job for me with the same oil for £_00 . 00 .
positive	well_worth the £ 0 . 00 difference in cost , not to scrabble about in the cold under my own car .

positive	all_round excellent service , and i '_ll definitely use them again .

positive	this is the second time i have bought a vehicle from jennings_ford on the strength of an internet_search .
positive	my previous experience with them was very good and i have no reason to change my mind , the purchase of the vehicle went_smoothly and without_any_problems .
positive	considering that i had not seen the vehicle until the day i purchased it i think that jennings_ford offer honestly and good value .
positive	the also added value to my purchase with a number of add - ons .
positive	once i had returned home , a 000 mile_journey , i noticed a door protector was missing from a front_door , a quick phone_call later and they were happy to reimburse me the cost , it was a 00 second job to fit it .
positive	the vehicle was serviced before i took delivery so i didn_'_t even bother to open the bonnet to have a look , though i probably should have .
positive	however when i got home and opened the bonnet for the first time i noticed that the coolant level was below minimum .
positive	i was concerned that there may have been a leak , but after topping it up there appears to be no movement in the level .
positive	i mentioned my concern to jennings_ford that this may have been overlooked and they will pass this on to the service department .
positive	just in case i will_continue to monitor the level .
positive	all in all , jennings_ford made it a painless task .
positive	everything was ready for me and as i had been expected i wasn_'_t made to wait .
positive	would i buy another vehicle from jennings_ford ?
positive	especially since i have a ford_dealership not more than 0 miles_away from where i live .
positive	definitely yes , because the service is better .

positive	whilst waiting to board the flight i gave sky_park a courtesy_call to let them know i wouldn ’_t be needed their services .
positive	i was greeted_by donna turner and was pleasantly_surprised by her understanding and general attitude .
positive	she was bright , attentive to my needs and refreshingly positive .
positive	i didn_’_t expect any kind of refund on my cancelled parking but donna explained that she would talk to the company and see if their driver had already been dispatched to pick me up .

positive	i had planned a trip to the farnborough airshow this year ( 0000 ), and wanted to explore a bit more with my camera , beyond what my standard zoom could do , so i did some looking online at places which would hire out some of the more " meaty " lenses .
positive	i decided to use lenses for hire .
positive	all my emails and questions were promptly answered within a couple of hours , there was plenty of advice as to which lens to select and all the staff that i dealt_with were very personable , friendly and knowledgeable .
positive	when it came to hiring , the lens turned_up on the day requested , extremely well_packaged , with full manual as well as comprehensive instructions on it '_s return delivery .
positive	what i particularly_liked was that although it was a 0 day hire , it was a full 0 days in my possession ... delivery timescales for receiving and sending back didnt count towards those 0 days .
positive	for example , i received the lens on a friday , and i didn_'_t actually have to post it back until a week the following_monday .
positive	i was very pleased with the service and i think good value for money .
positive	i was pleased with ( most !)
positive	of my pictures from the weekend .
positive	i would certainly use them again and not_hesitate to recommend them to others .
positive	if you want a blind you def need this company .
positive	company who i bought of were brill when i told them about the poor delivery service .
positive	had a text to say it would be there between 00 ; 00to 00 ; 00 in all morning waiting .
positive	had a text 00 ; 00 tried to deliver could not get parcel signed for returned to depot as nobody in flat .???
positive	?
positive	well i was in flat i rang interlink up told them i was in all morning waiting they said sorry will be delivered the next_day not good enough they said they will try to contact driver came back to me they could not get in contact with driver . i was still not happy and told them they must deliver it today they came back to tell me it would be delivered by 0 pm .
positive	so i got in touch with the company i bought it off told them what has_gone on , they told me they would ring back less_than 0 mins they rang me to say it would be delivered in 0 mins , went out side of main flats door ther was a card saying they could not get answer to flat which was a lie big lie .
positive	the driver brought my parcel asked if he had pressed the flat number 00 no the numbers only went up to 0 .
positive	so proved they had lied about nobody in flat how many more customers do they do this too .
positive	finally never use interlink again
positive	i went looking for six led_bulbs for my house , and found a variety of price / shipping options from various suppliers for the bulb i was looking for .

positive	the bulbs were delivered quickly and well_packaged to save them from the ravages of shipping .
positive	all in all a great purchase experience .

positive	i heard that you could get things called " pedal extenders " and when i googled this i found sigma_sport selling a specialized branded pair for a tenner so i made the purchase .
positive	top_marks to sigma_sport , the product was dispatched the same day i ordered and i received the parcel the next_day .
positive	the extenders are made from stainless_steel and are nicely machined .
positive	a small sachet of grease is included .
positive	they have an l and a r etched into them to identify on which crank to fit them .
positive	i only fitted the right hand_side extender .
positive	it fitted_perfectly .
positive	as it '_s hollow i could use an allen_key to tighten the pedal itself .
positive	these extenders are 00mm wide , this was sufficient to move the pedal far enough out so that my heal no_longer rubs anywhere .
positive	clipping in to the spd seemed easier .
positive	there was no feeling that i was pedalling with my feet too far apart , it felt really comfortable as i could let my foot take up it '_s natural sticking out position with no fear of catching something with my heal .

positive	tripadvisor is the first place to visit to get a great overall view of all_sorts of places , resorts , hotels , things to see , activities to join in with .
positive	its as good as listening to the advice of friends and family .
positive	as with all things generated by human_beings it is open to a whole range of opinions .
positive	so yes - read the reviews and especially look for the latest ones as places and people do change over time .
positive	then use your own common_sense and you can read between the lines .
positive	look for reviews from similar people like yourselves e . g .
positive	couples or adults with children to see how appropriate their review is to your own situation and you shouldn_'_t go far wrong .
positive	for instance with a restaurant review , look for references to use by locals ……. if they are using the place for meeting and eating , then they are probably the best recommendation you could get .
positive	likewise returnees to a hotel or apartment complex will be confident of what is on offer .
positive	good researching to you all !
positive	i like getting the weekly newsletter and the helpful forums .
positive	advice is clearly_explained and includes lots of comparisons which are very helpful .
positive	generally excellent products more often than not backed by long guarantees - good quality , even if not well_known_brands which get good reviews for specifications .

positive	great product , great price & good service .
positive	buy with confidence .
positive	it ’_s great to see a company compete with amazon and beat them of price .
positive	i expect they probably beat them on paying their proper share of uk tax too ?
positive	give them a try .
positive	goods came when advised , well_packed and first_class service
positive	it was a pain doing an official_unlock .
positive	i think if i had known this service earlier , i would have saved a lot of time and money .
positive	i thank them for all they have done .
positive	good effort .
positive	i '_ve_used printer_basics for my kodak esp0 for several_years_now and have never had any problem whatsoever .
positive	i know a lot of people seem to think that cartridges made by other than the original maufacturers do not last , do not give good performance and can damage your printer , but that has not been my experience and will_continue to use your proucts .
positive	to be honest , i am very new to the supplement / workout arena .
positive	however , i believe that as a newcomer to the game there are some differences that separate me from those who have been in this arena for a long time .
positive	i believe that as a newcomer i am not blinded by any bias .
positive	i can look at different companies and websites and compare them objectively .
positive	although i am sure that people have had troubles and shortcomings with different sites and different companies for whatever_reason , as a first - time buyer i do not have any of these prior ideas that taint my mind .
positive	who_knows , maybe in a couple weeks my view of this company might have changed for the worst , although i hope that is not the case .
positive	however , in comparing different sites and different companies , i believe that supplementwarehouse is the most upfront , direct , and truthful company when it comes down to pricing and their service towards making_sure you get what you are looking for at the price you want it .
positive	the one thing that bothered me initially was that shipping to my particular residence was $_00 and i believed this was absurd .
positive	yet , what they claimed ( and was true ) was that the price that other_sites / companies offer with free shipping or lower shipping_costs was lower_than the $_00 shipping + price of the products on their site .
positive	although i only compared the certain products i was buying , i bet this is true for a large variety of items on their site .
positive	another thing that i really enjoyed was that they had these packages at checkout $_00 . 00 or $_00 . 00 or $_00 . 00 which all offered different things .
positive	but the greatest thing was , if you bought this package you got a credit towards your shipping .
positive	why not get all these free things when you have to pay the same amount for shipping anyways ?
positive	anyways , i am happy with this company and i hope that this transaction goes through smoothly so that i can continue to purchase from this company in the future .
positive	bought a pair of thin sealskinz for fell running .
positive	great price and fast delivery .
positive	can '_t fault the service at all and would and have since recommended the site to my friends
positive	i placed my ( first ) order by telephone , calling from the channel_islands .
positive	the order was taken swiftly and efficiently .
positive	within a very short time , i received an e_- mail confirmation .

positive	the goods arrived in excellent condition just a week_later .

positive	i look_forward to placing further orders in future .
positive	well_done !

positive	both orders were placed on a sunday .
positive	three_days_later , e_- mails were received confirming dispatch of the goods , which were received within 00_hours of dispatch .
positive	given that the company is based in northern_ireland and i am now living on the channel_island of sark , this really is fantastic service .
positive	thank_you and well_done !
positive	as always , first_class service from a reliable online pharmacy .

positive	i cannot_fault petmeds !
positive	simple ordering_process , quick dispatch and delivery .
positive	prices are always competitive and more often than not the cheapest available .
positive	seems a nice product , with quick delivery
positive	this is a great cover and i can '_t believe the low price with tablet wake_up too .
positive	delivery excellent nothing to fault .
positive	having reviewed many options online and on the high_street i realised that the diamond_factory offered the best value rings .
positive	unfortunately i realised this too late for a bespoke ring so rang up to see what options i had .
positive	the woman i spoke to was very helpful and said you would ring back in 00_minutes which she did .
positive	i was given a choice of a similar ring to the one i was initially looking for that could be delivered within 0 days so i ordered it .
positive	delivery was on time and the ring was as good as expected .
positive	would highly_recommend .

positive	having found lfh on the internet , and having a good look at their site and what lenses they had to offer , prices etc , i was stuck between the 000mm_f0 . 0 and the 000mm_f0 , i opted for the 000mm .
positive	i have never used such a big lense before , and even had to borrow a tripod while i had it , even_though some super mortals on the internet say they can hand hold this lense , well , maybe for one or two shots , but certainly not for all day jaunts .
positive	i went to scotland with the lense photographing ospreys , which i did manage to capture .. i also went to southern scotland photographing red kites , and in my home country of northumberland photographed sand martins at their nests and many other birds , making full use of the lense when it was mine , albeit temporarily .
positive	the lense on my nikon_d000 performed well , at time i also added my nikon 0 . 0tc which gave_me 000 at f0 .

positive	to be honest i '_ve never got the time to drive here and there to check prices , so i looked through the obvious ( and some less obvious ) websites to see what sort of deal i could get .

positive	i realised that if i selected the mobile fitting service it wasn_'_t going to cost me anymore , plus i didn_'_t need to spend time and fuel travelling to get the tyres done !
positive	perfect , just my sort of deal ..

positive	the guy that turned_up to do the fitting was very knowledgable and checked the other 0 tyres to , making_sure their pressures were correct .

positive	i wanted a good warm pair of mitts for skiing on those really cold days when gloves aren_'_t up to it .
positive	having read a few reviews i decided that either dakine rover of dakine titan mitts were the way to go .
positive	over the past couple of weeks i have tried retail ski outlets in norwich , edinburgh and london - some 00 shops in all .
positive	they each had a pretty poor selection on mitts in general and none of them stocked the ones on my short list .
positive	in contrast the surfdome website had a really comprehensive_range of mitts including the ones i wanted .
positive	i phoned them up today and spoke to their glove / mitt expert who gave_me informed advice .
positive	i have now ordered via their website a medium and a large size of both the rover and the titan mitts , so that i can try them on at home , decide what i want and send the other 0 pairs back under their free return service .

positive	the mr_memory website makes choosing memory_upgrades trivially simple .
positive	several_times i have assisted friends who were purchasing memory , but were nervous_about buying the wrong items , being inexperienced and confused by all the technical terms .
positive	no_worries , as the memory selection tools meant they could easily have done it themselves .
positive	top_marks to mr_memory .
positive	beautifully simple interface , where one only enters the vehicle_registration_number to receive a selection of suitable tyres .

positive	things just couldn_'_t be easier .

positive	their online_chat service is extremely_helpful in cases where the exact part required is difficult to identify .

positive	the xlarge size is not too large on me bearing in mind 0 ) above .
positive	0 ) the front zip allows me to overcome ' inconvenient convenience ' problems associated with a rear zip .
positive	i have bought a ' shewee ' at the suggestion of a female paddling companion to assist in this , particularly in the cold .
positive	0 ) being an xlarge size and therefore long in the ' body ' i have found i have to be careful to ensure the zip is fully open to take it off ( i didn_'_t do this the first time and was well and truly trapped until i asked a stranger out for walk to help and she pointed_out my error out to me ).
positive	my experience so_far with this drysuit would lead me to recommend it whole - heartedly .

positive	fantastic service , prompt delivery and the goods were faultless .
positive	i ordered a gns 0000 receiver and a kneepad for my ipad_mini to work with my trial of skydemon .
positive	the order was very prompt to arrive and i have no issues associated with transair .
positive	the av0tor kneepad , however , is a different_story .
positive	it seems nice and well_constructed and i was keen to get it into the air and try the whole system out , which i did on saturday .
positive	the main problem is there was no way ( in my jodel dr0000 ) that i could position the kneepad so i could use all its and the ipad '_s functionality .
positive	if i put it on my right knee , the top panel interfered with the stick when open ( and blocks the ipad when closed .
positive	on my left knee , the only compromise was to open it and put the top panel down between my leg and the side of the cockpit , so there was no point in having an opening kneeboard ( and it was still marginal in terms of clearance ).
positive	i have no_complaints - i bought the device to test it out and my testing proved that i would have been better off having the ipad_mini as a separate , free standing unit in the case i keep it in when at home .
positive	then i can sit it on my lap as required and put it out of the way when i don_'_t need / want it .
positive	i '_m only writing this review to save other pilots from making the same mistake .
positive	if i had been flying something with a yoke , it probably would have worked very well on my right knee - so i '_m not anti the product , just make_sure you will have room to use it .
positive	cyclestore have products i couldn_'_t find elsewhere , with very low_prices compared to similar products .
positive	delivery was very fast .
positive	knowledgeable team who know their products , delivered next_day with no extra_charge
positive	service first_class fast delivery good price , could not ask for better ,
positive	the site was great and the process was easy from_start to finish .
positive	follow this up with quick delivery and an ecxellent case - i really can '_t fault my experience .
positive	i hunted through many different sites and found feel good to be the cheapest by in some cases a lot of money for exactly the same product , there was one slight_hic up in the type and strength of lenses i needed were out of stock ( not overly surprised have had issues with this from others before ), but when i advised i required them sooner_than they could get them to me and asked if they could be sent out via next_day delivery when they were ready , which i was prepared to pay for , i was upgraded to next_day for free .
positive	they emailed me every_step of the way , even being_able to send them out earlier_than predicted arriving 0 days earlier_than_expected .
positive	still had to wait 0 0 / 0_weeks for them but with the level and professional service they provided over pervious suppliers i am more than happy to recommend them to other people .
positive	having looked through many tyre websites was very pleased to find tyre_shopper .
positive	easy to use website very user_friendly , good options unlike_other_sites , helpfull on - line chat_function ,.
positive	i will and have recomended to others and will_definately be my 0st port of call the next time i require tyres .
positive	i placed my order and after i had sent the order i realised i had ordered the wrong_size tees ( there was a lot of them - 000 ).
positive	i thought what chance have i got of getting the order changed in such a short_space of time ?
positive	well actually after a short email note i received a response within minutes advising me that the order had been changed and was on its way at no additional_charge .
positive	exemplary service without_doubt .
positive	this company is to be_commended !
positive	bay fitted , though i removed the " contact " plate from the leads , and solder on a much longer lead .
positive	that reached the back of the case , going down the inside front , bottom and halfway up the bac to the case to the one of the motherboard case fan connectors .
positive	packages arrived in excellecnt shape .
positive	the only thing that caught me , was a presumption on my part .
positive	i thought cdi , meant a button start .
positive	but it had pull - cord start .
positive	so if in doubt , ask the questions , their onlne form , when used is excellent .
positive	had my order in 0 days .
positive	thanks guys .
positive	the web_site is easy to use , and for an old git like me who is only now starting to use the internet is was a pleasure .... martin .
positive	having done the ' bloke thing ' and left everything to the last_minute was absolutely_thrilled to bits when df said they could help get the rings in time .
positive	high_street_shops all said 0 - 0_weeks so i was in great doubt when they said they could deliver in the 0_weeks that we had left .
positive	well they delivered early .... as promised ..... and the rings were just as shown online .
positive	i received a phone_call the night before to tell me to expect the delivery along with a tracking_number .
positive	packaged beautifully along with a credit_card with ring details and insurance valuation_certificate .

positive	very good service .
positive	products taste great
positive	the staff in the ayr branch were very helpfull and the items were delivered very quickly .
positive	the only down_side was the mountain of packaging that comes with the items ( but you get you items undamaged ).
positive	in all fairness the staff did tell us there was a lot of packaging .
positive	fast delivery
positive	best price available , fifa_00 , and was delivered 00_hours_later .
positive	cant_fault them and would use again
positive	hadn_'_t heard of this company before when i came_across them on the net .
positive	slightly_wary to use them but the reviews on tripadvisor and other_sites spoke highly of them .
positive	ordered tickets on wednesday and got them the following_day via_recorded delivery , would recommend this company
positive	ordered tuesday_afternoon and came next_day .
positive	well_packaged as well .
positive	a fantastic service .
positive	i wish all companies were like this .
positive	delivery in just one day as promised .
positive	good service ,
positive	nothing is ever too much_trouble , for mini / mini vinyl graphics minipirate are second to none .
positive	as the title_suggests , they are nearly always the cheapest , never get to hotel to find booking isn_'_t made .
positive	based on the their performance over the last few_years i will not need to look anywhere_else .
positive	i always use their reserve and collect facility if the price is already competative , the guys in my local_stores ( wakefield and huddersfield ) are very knowledgable .
positive	if i want something that is cheaper_elsewhere jessops will do their best to match it if not beat it .
positive	very happy with the t000sr wheel , but was disappointed that the hard back manual was not included .

positive	the manual would be very welcome .
positive	:)

positive	when i first considered trying to improve on the very poor savings rates currently on offer , bearing in mind that as a retired person i am largely dependent on savings income , i was surprised to note the possible benefits of peer to peer_lending .
positive	the interest_rates potentially available greatly exceeded those offered by conventional savings institutes .
positive	i confess i remained somewhat wary about opting for this route , but as i intended to fund the investment by disposing of some shares , i concluded that the risks involved were no greater than investing in the stock market .
positive	this view was supported_by my financial_adviser .
positive	i thus made a significant investment in a bond with wellesley & co , which offered a very attractive interest_rate .
positive	i have , since making the investment , which proved to be easy , had excellent service from the company and am satisfied that i made a sensible investment decision .
positive	in all probability i will be going down this route again in the not too_distant_future .
positive	i used webtogs for the first time .
positive	i was impressed by the range of poles available and purchased two leki poles , which were considerably_cheaper_than the price proposed by the shop i visited in bristol .

positive	ebay is a wonderful website that i use every day , thinks to the site i have been able to start my own business with very few overheads , and find their pricing very reasonable as a seller .
positive	all the disputes iv head with them as a buyer and seller have been handled very well , and they can not be held_responsible for the conduct of all there users , though it would be nice if sellers could go back to leaving negative_feedback where necessary .
positive	only_downside is there constant efforts to change " my ebay " the latest changes included putting the " selling " section on another page , removing it for the general overview page ........ in context its only one extra click to check your selling items !
positive	switch over to tesco for my weekly_shop a couple of months back , and have not had a single problem with delivery , alternatives or damaged goods .
positive	the drivers have always been really helpful , even helping to carry the good up to my third floor_flat .
positive	the layout of the website took a little_bit of getting used to , and it would be nice to be able to narrow_down the searches to " own - brand " or list by cheapest .... but perhaps they are included features i '_m just missing how to use ?
positive	iv used amazon lost over the last couple of year from physical goods to downloadable content and have yet to be let_down in any way .
positive	prices are competitive , delivers are secure and refillable and customer service were helpful and informed !
positive	also like thire free application for kindleoooks making the reader free across all the main platforms !

positive	recommended .
positive	i '_ve only bought one product from these_guys & i keep going back for more because it works .
positive	it '_s the diamond moth traps .
positive	now i just buy refills .
positive	you might say , if it works , hasn_'_t it killed off all the moths , and if so why are you going back for more ?
positive	because i know nothing is likely to totally get_rid of the moths in my flat and this product is at_least keeping them under control .
positive	( it '_s actually designed to monitor the moth population , as they make clear , not eradicate it , but helps keep numbers down )
positive	no more holes in wooly jumpers !

positive	i was very dubious at first of such sites , however after doing a bit of net research found that mazuma was one of the best so decided to give it a go .
positive	i logged in and got the price for my iphone , and within a couple of days had recieved a letter containing instructions of how to send .
positive	due to the value £_000 . 00 i decided to pack it securely and pay a little extra to send it special delivery , pretty_much as soon as it had been delivered i had an email to say that it had been recieved , and within a couple of hours a further mail to say that the money was transfered .
positive	after checking my bank in the evening , it was there !

positive	decided to use this company after absolutely woeful service from interflora .
positive	i complained to them and they even managed to screw up the complaint .
positive	utterly complacent and behind the times company living off previous brandname and reputation which is now wholly unjustified .

positive	on time , on price and easy .

positive	took no time at all to place an order and it was despatched and arrived all within a week .
positive	haven_'_t tried the waterless cleaner yet so can '_t comment on it personally but have heard_nothing but good about it so had no_reservations when it came to placing an order .
positive	i would not go past this company , their '_s is the best service & their prices for all that i wanted are very competitive , each time the order was there in a few_days , as i said above 0st_class , i will use vet -_medic everytime
positive	great company to deal with good prices and special_offers .
positive	only bad_experience i '_ve had is a circular_saw i bought didn_'_t come with a carry_case and it didn_'_t state that in the listing , so it cost me another £_00 for a case .
positive	definitely buying from d & m tools again .

positive	great website with a variety of products available .
positive	i found just what i was looking for and at very good value
positive	spent a great deal of time looking over the entire range of watches that watchfinder
positive	had available prior to choosing the one i ordered .
positive	not physically seeing the watch i was a little_apprehensive_about ordering it on line , but upon_receipt i was absolutely_delighted with my choice .

positive	the company offer a good range of glasses all at a very reasonable price compared to the high_street companies .
positive	the company offer a very good service with fast delivery
positive	my advice would be go for it you have nothing to lose
positive	first tempted by the price , having been told by the high_street_opticians the ridiculous prices they charge , so i thought i had nothing to lose .
positive	easy to select from a great selection of frames and input information was easy to do .
positive	when they arrived they looked excellent
positive	i bought another pair of distance glasses as well which are excellent .
positive	i did have one tiny problem with one of the fixings but having contacted their customer service department , , which was easy to do , they fixed the problem politely and with 0_star treatment
positive	go for it thats what i would say
positive	this supplier is fast becoming my first choice because you can guarantee the prices will be rock_bottom and the service excellent .
positive	another longer established web based company in the same market has_been taken over by a large chain , opened shops and allowed its business model to change to the more mainstream retail offering e . g .
positive	keeping the prices of some items high so promotions can announce massive_discounts .
positive	as long as ffx keeps to the existing business model i will remain a faithful and very satisfied customer - well_done .
positive	it is a brilliant service , very fast & reliable , definetly recommended although the prices could do with being a touch higher but can '_t complain !
positive	most definetly better_than ' other ' sites !
positive	i will be using the service again !
positive	fast delivery

positive	it arrived quickly and the site is simple to nagivate along with a great community .
positive	cant_fault them and would highly_recommend .
positive	hi , as someone_who is accustomed to buying games and dvds from amazon , i was prompted to look for an_alternative source , when the product i was looking for was was expensive .
positive	i found videogame box through google_search and was attracted_by the competitive price , however , i was unsure_about dealing_with ( for me ) an unknown retailer .
positive	anyway , i can confirm that i am_delighted with the price of the product , the prompt delivery and product quality .
positive	in future , i will look at videogames site whenever i am looking for games .
positive	happy to recommend them .
positive	items ordered were the cheapest i found on the internet .
positive	shipping was very quick too .
positive	they have quite a large range of products .
positive	also it '_s always been the cheapest place to find stuff i need .
positive	the price was reasonable , probably the same or slighlty less_than i could have achieved selling_privately via somewhere like ebay but it was so much_easier .
positive	and for a guaranteed price i would use mazuma every time !
positive	the free post bag arrived quickly .
positive	once posted it was probably only another week or so before the money was in my account .
positive	can '_t fault the service , this was the 0nd time using the service ( once in uk and once in aus ) and i would use again .
positive	definitely recommend .
positive	trustworthy site , would defo_use again

positive	faced with a decision which could impact on my financial wellbeing for the rest of my life ( literally ) i scoured various journals and news paper articles for unbiased_advice and one message came through loud and clear , look beyond your pension_providers annuity offer before that life long commitment is made , but where do you start , with whom do you place your trust to achieve the best annuity for your particular circumstances .
positive	key_retirement solutions stood_out they made it clear from the start that they would approach such an undertaking by treating each applicant as an individual thus maximising the offer , michelle my contact was refreshingly open and honest making it clear there was a cost to such assistance but assured me the ultimate provider would fund this as they did .
positive	without going into the details of the process involved in gaining enhancements to my offer , whatever fee michelle earned was more than justified she worked_tirelessly to achieve the successful results making the process entirely painless for me , consequently i dropped the lesser offers from the several other_companies i contacted , and with her assistance successfully concluded a significantly better offer than that from my incumbent pension_provider , i don_'_t know the extent of her working day , but i know that on any occasion that a query popped up she was immediately available to help .
positive	i cannot recommend more strongly that you give key_retirement solutions the chance to prove themselves .
positive	straight_forward nice and easy

positive	i placed my order at 0 . oclock friday_evening and it arrived in the post the following_morning .

positive	very good .
positive	i bought this deal for a 00 page book saving a lot of money and find it excellent to have as a keepsake to look at .

positive	a great gift to get someone so they can treasure happy memories of a family event or showing kids growing up .
positive	would definitely recommend this to anyone .
positive	i '_ve been interested in supplements for health since about 00 years old and have tried quite a few down the years for conditions suck as osteo arthritis of the hips and moderate depression and as such i '_ve tried quite a few company '_s that sell these pills and potions and i can tell you that , what you have here with simply_supplements is the highest utmost standards and best customer_services i '_ve ever come_across .
positive	there products are all good manufacturing practice approved and eu compliant meaning they cant be_bettered quality wise .
positive	as for the price well it really is surprising at times , in high_street_shops people are buying highly inflated products the simply_supplements very often sell that are 00 - 00_%_cheaper and equally as important much much stronger !

positive	going to see if i have anymore now
positive	i ordered 00m of lay_flat hose and a connector for joining to an existing hose .
positive	order process was fine as has_been all information re : progress of order
positive	surprised though that the connector has_been delivered with the hose to follow later .

positive	but good news ; the hose ordered was not available so a better quality alternative was quickly despatched at no extra_cost .
positive	brilliant
positive	first_class product , well_packed and delivered . would buy from this company again .
positive	the instructions i received did not explain how to fix the vertical slats on once you had fitted the top rail { steps 0 - 0 ), i had hung some vertical_blinds before so knew how to fix the weights and links on , but a novice would have had a few problems .
positive	other than that , they were exactly_what i ordered , of good quality and fitted spot on in my recessed front window which is nearly 00ft wide . they were well_packed and arrived within a reasonable time span .
positive	i would buy some more blinds from 000blinds .

positive	we were looking for a good quality modern mirrored side board , to replace our perfectly fine 00 year_old wooden display_cabinet .
positive	like most on - line buyers our first_port of call was ebay .
positive	but found thefurnituremarket . co . uk site with a simple google_search .
positive	it '_s now saved to our browser shopping favourites .

positive	effortless superb service .
positive	thank_you
positive	the whole_experience of ordering from this company has_been excellent .
positive	the quality and prentation of the products purchased was outstanding
positive	our product , chrome_shelving finally arrived today , it was very easy to assemble , it '_s stable and we are very happy with this product ....
positive	can '_t say_fairer_than that .
positive	i '_ll be honest , my experience of ordering from thedrinkshop . com could have gone one of two ways .
positive	in the end , i was left with the feeling that the staff there had gone the extra_mile to ensure i received excellent service in the face of problems created by a third_party .
positive	i wanted to get something special for two of my best friends 00th birthdays .
positive	the wide_selection of drinks and the reasonable prices ( when compared to other web - based drinks shops ) meant i decided to go for thedrinkshop . com , despite having never_heard of them or used them before .
positive	the two friends in question ( twin brothers ) lived in leeds and manchester respectively and both lived in apartment blocks .
positive	this was where the problem lied .
positive	my two orders on the website were very smooth and the items were dispatched quickly , but as the delivery drivers of the courier firm that was used were unable to gain_access to the buildings , different problems occurred with each .
positive	i won_'_t bore you with the details , but what i will say , is that the customer service staff at thedrinkshop went out of their way to help me resolve the problems with each , even arguing my case ( successfully ) with the courier when they asked me to pay a redelivery charge .
positive	when i found out about the issues with each order , i did think_twice about whether it was a good choice of supplier .
positive	but the fault laid solely at the fault of the delivery service and the fact that they took charge of a problem created by someone_else and resolved it made me feel very confident about using them again .
positive	there are many web - based companies who are happy to shirk any sort of responsibility once they have your money and have carried_out the minimum required of them .
positive	so all in all , thedrinkshop . com gets full_marks from me .
positive	it is rare for me to take the time out to review a company for good service , but i certainly feel they deserve it .
positive	i also feel that with so many people living in access controlled apartment blocks now it is time for couriers to come up with a better solution than just giving up and going home when the front_door won_'_t open , but that '_s another issue .
positive	i have a problem with the veterinary culture in the uk .
positive	it '_s probably going to cost you less to consult a harley_street doctor than it is to take your beloved_dog to a vet .
positive	it '_s as simple as that !
positive	why feel_ripped_off with the prices of meds from your vet ?
positive	this us the second time using echo , each time i '_ve found excellent deals and on my latest order i saved up to £_00 .
positive	not only was the deal advertised with after shaker but there was also a fee protein_bar in the box , which was great as it was an extra protein hit during my busy working day .
positive	it '_s little_touches like this that make the difference and i will use again when my current supplement need renewal .
positive	price was good , coat was delivered quickly and as ordered ... what more could you want !
positive	will use again .
positive	the whole_process of entering requirements , options_available showing up , booking it and paying took less_than 0 minutes .
positive	excellent .
positive	we use skyparksecure most times that we fly , and will_continue to do so in the future .
positive	found what i want on line .
positive	ordered it , arrived 0 days_later in the post .
positive	fitted within 00_minutes .
positive	:-)

positive	i recently_purchased a high end pair of beyerdynamic_headphones - i called hifiheadphones in advance and talked through my options - they reccommended a pair of headphones much_cheaper_than my original decision - although in the event i went for the expensive ones anyway .
positive	the products ( headphones and amplifier ) arrived following_day and to cap it all they sent me a lollipop !
positive	the hifiheadphone website was simply the most informative and clear headphone review and advice site i found after much research - i reccommend this shop without_hesitation .
positive	easiest and fastest phone buying service i have used
positive	natalie parchment shoots & scores yet again , unbelievable service , latest mont_blanc timewalker ceramic sourced within 00 miles of where i live , & then the extra_mile in service was achieved when the dealer hand delivered the time piece within 00_hrs to my office .

positive	the internet site was easy to understand and uncomplicated , the transaction was dealt_with quickly and efficiently , the postage information and packaging arrive within 0 days , this was returned following the simple instructions , and the money was paid into my bank 0 days_later , all in all a very easy and well managed way of doing busines , would recomend to anyone , thanks

positive	i '_ve been a member of quidco since the begining , and in that time have received over £ 0 , 000 in cashback .
positive	when things go_wrong their support is good .
positive	nothing much more to say - i think they ' re great !
positive	whenever i buy anything new , i always visit quidco to see if they can save me money - its quite normal to find the best insurance via a comparison site , then come_back to quidco to get another £_00 off !
positive	it is important to remember : cashback is never guaranteed , there '_s only perhaps an 00_% hit rate .
positive	but considering this is ' free money ' you can '_t complain !

positive	this was the first time i '_ve ordered from lindy_uk and their service was outstanding .
positive	from my first e_- mail inquiry to the final delivery of the goods the service was very fast throughout and the personal_touch was evident at every point .
positive	it could not be improved .
positive	i had a few problems with the site when placing my order , but with the help of my telephone contact at adband i was able to resolve these fairly easily .
positive	one thing i did find , however , which could prove a little annoying was coming right to the end of the order before finding out the method of payment , most unfortunate if you are buying goods for your organisation and don_'_t want to pay for them with your personal credit_card .
positive	it would be helpful if the payment_method could be shown prominently on the first page of the order form , other methods of payment would also be helpful such as bacs , cheque or paypal .
positive	otherwise first_class service - many_thanks

positive	trustpilot is a flawed system .
positive	you can overide the authorisation_code normally by typing in a sequence of numbers ( 000000 ) or letters ( abcdefg0 ).
positive	you can reply as a company even when you are not the company .

positive	i bet after a few_seconds , this comment will be deleted because trustpilot is also an unmanned system , no body is ever checking .
positive	only if it is in the interest of trustpilot .

positive	i came_across e_- bookers some time ago using skyscanner .
positive	since then , i check e_- bookers when i am considering making a flight or hotel booking because the prices are generally ( not always ) the cheapest i can find on the net , using quality airlines .
positive	my most_recent booking through e_- bookers was substantially_cheaper_than booking through the airline itself , so its a no_brainer really .
positive	“ hi there !

positive	the goods were exactly as_described nd cheaper_than any competitor .
positive	i have been asked to write a revue about my experience with key_solutions and this has to be one of the easiest tasks i been requested to do .
positive	main_reason is that when faced with a considerable_amount of money and what to do with it in order to get the best deal for you , then there is always a worry that you may choose the wrong doors to go through but with the help of employees like leanne_smith , who , with her expertise in guiding_me through the transition process it was made very simple indeed and hassle_free , so for that i have to say a huge thank_you to her for that service .
positive	now if that is what the company does for me what could it do for you .

positive	for the price the product is better_than can be expected .
positive	they are almost_half the price of the cheapest rival i can find .

positive	if you bet even just a couple of times a month , you really should be using oddschecker to get best value !

positive	having used webtogs for sometime now , i have seen their consistancy in excellent customer service and that makes a huge_difference for me when choosing an online_retailer , but not only do they keep this level of support , but they also show the same consistancy on other levels , their communications via the social medias , and of course their competitive_prices .. if they were to provide a wider scope of hiking_gear ( watches , tools ), then i would be happy to use them as my sole provider for everything outdoors

positive	i feel better in myself also as i always thought i looked ugly in glases .
positive	glasses also change in style so i no_longer have to worry_about any of that .
positive	optimax were and are the best in my opinion .
positive	dont_waste your time with all the other_places as they dont even have full time surgeons .
positive	they just franchise themselves out .
positive	easy to navigate and informative website .
positive	excellent prices and service .
positive	not that i like to complain however .

positive	the lady on the phone was polite and really helped_me understand what tyres i needed to go for .
positive	i made my selection , booked the most suitable day for me , sat back and relaxed .
positive	the day of the fitting came .
positive	i received a call from the fitter promptly at 0 . 00am who said he would be there at 00am and at exactly 00 . 00am he turned_up .

positive	" all included in the service ," he said .

positive	0 .
positive	the super_fast 0g speed and coverage .
positive	0 .
positive	the out of this world customer service .

positive	i could go on about just how great 00 are , however i believe the above five points pretty_much clarifies why i rate 00 at one of the best mobile_phone providers in the uk , that i have had the pleasure to use .
positive	i cant_wait for my next mobile_phone upgrade and tariff review , as i am more than confident it will add even more value for money .
positive	well_done o0 .
positive	i have been a loyal_customer with argos for over 00 years , and have never had any_problems with the products or prices that they offer .
positive	the ingenious solution in solving shop pilfering by keeping the goods in the back of the shop , is quite_simply a fantastic idea , that will probably be used by more retailers in the next few_years .
positive	i believe this is probably why they can keep there prices so low , and also offer great product promotions at the same time .
positive	if you want value for money , then argos is the place to be .
positive	if you appreciate up to date facts , results and general nascar information , then you have to visit this website .
positive	i have been viewing this nascar resource for the last few_years , and have never had any_problems viewing there website , or questioning the integrity of the information supplied on there .
positive	a top nascar resource
positive	if you are looking to buy a great value mountain_bike , then look no further .
positive	halfords are quite_simply one of the cheapest suppliers in the uk .
positive	my local bike shop wanted £_000 for a pretty average mountain_bike , then i went to my local halfords and found exactly the same bike there for £_000 .
positive	that '_s a huge_difference in price , and also confirms that halfords really do offer fantastic and very much_appreciated value for money .
positive	saving this amount of money is great , however also makes you feel quite annoyed at the local_shops that clearly try to extort more money for the same item .
positive	well_done halfords , keep_up the great work .
positive	out of all of the uk hypermarkets , i have to rate morrisons in the top 0 , they offer fantastic value for money , and the staff are a breathe of fresh_air .

positive	it fitted my samsung_galaxy_s0 perfectly .
positive	the only issue i have with the case is i use an aux cable regularly in my car to play music through the stereo and you have to push the cable quite firm to fit past the silicone casing .
positive	other than that delivery time was great and i '_m happy i spent the money on a decent good quality case
positive	easy to place order , even from overseas .
positive	will use them again ..
positive	this site is the best i used instagamepoints and got scammed paid but never recieved code but this site is awesome
positive	top_notch !
positive	does what it says on the tin .
positive	well impressed ... and that '_s rare !!!!
positive	!
positive	website was very informative .
positive	ordered the part and received it within two_days and was kept_informed via_email on the progress of more order .
positive	the only_slight comment i would make is that when diagnosing the problem with my shower and reading the question and answer section the answers indicated that if the solenoid had a resistance of 0 . 0kohm or more than it was ok .
positive	however , mine was about 0 . 0kohms therefore this would indicate that it was ok .
positive	the problems i was having indicated to me that it was the solenoid and this is what i replaced and hey_presto all was good .
positive	however , this is an excellent website and i will be using it again ( hopefully not too often as do not want to be repairing my shower too frequently ).
positive	absolutely_brilliant service !
positive	and i will_definitely use again and again .
positive	i needed a lens to get to me as early as possible the next_day and it arrived - it was brilliant - allowed_me to set off early to the event i needed to photograph .

positive	couple that with excellent service and you ' re on to a real_winner

positive	i recently_purchased the simcity 0000 serial_number online .
positive	i had never bought a game online like this before and was unsure if it was a good idea , i thought maybe i should just go into_town and buy it from a shop like the good old days .
positive	my friend recommended cjs to me via a link on facebook .
positive	he told me that he buys all his games direct from cjs as they process orders automatically and you get your serial_number straight_away unlike_other_sites that can leave you waiting days sometimes even weeks to reply with a working serial_number .
positive	i paid via_paypal and was instantly able to view my new simcity serial_number , i entered the code in the origin console under the ' redeem product ' tab and began downloading the full version of the game ...
positive	happy days !
positive	:)
positive	i would recommend cjs to any gamer that does not want to pay full price for a game !
positive	why pay full price when you can go to cjs !

positive	shop quoted me when i called in
positive	the girl on the helplne was very helpful and got my tyre_fitting a day earlier
positive	really happy with the purchase
positive	at first i was of course a bit_dubious .
positive	when something on the net seems too good to be true , 0 . 00 times out of 00 it is .
positive	however , after helping_me find a great phone tariff at the same time as giving me over half of the total monthly_fee back i would strongly_advise you to have a look on this site before buying anything because it is totally worth it .

positive	although getting the finance on my bike took longer_than_expected ( outside pedalon '_s control ) at every_stage they reacted within the hour to my emails and when the bike arrived the courier took till 0 . 00 on the day to deliver , but pedalon staff were great on the phone checking and chasing and called me back at 0 . 00pm to make_sure it was all good .... which it was .
positive	so overall i really couldn_'_t recommend pedalon themselves enough .... great staff attitudes and service .
positive	just surfing the net for another load of batteries ( everything seems to require them these days ), when i came_across battery_force .

positive	quality products with first_class service .
positive	once i had mastered the effort of finding the imei_numbers from the phone , the whole_process from there was fantastic customer service experience .
positive	simple and very effect to use , the website was a breeze .

positive	who really understands ' collision waiver " and even if you have it , there '_s usually an excess or stuff that isn_'_t covered eg wheels , glass , etc .
positive	( and don_'_t mention " fuel_policy " without thinking_about rip - off !)
positive	to me it seems wiser to keep hire car costs under control and buy hire insurance that would fill the gaps - and it was a very smooth_operation .
positive	i had a query about the number of drivers and my telephone_enquiry was courteously handled .
positive	and if you make several trips a year , often with the same people , and to different places , an annual_policy prices appear to be great value .
positive	but as i say , buying insurance is one step - and in this case very easy .
positive	i can '_t say anything about claims handling - and hope not to find out
positive	i '_ve not had ppi trouble , nor in real need for much of what mse sends out - but an invaluable site to get sound_advice on everything that may involve spending money

positive	anyway i needn_'_t have worried .

positive	frank galloway of galloway consultancy services ltd is a highly experienced auditor of business systems who helped_me get to grips with the chaotic systems i was working with even_though i wasn_'_t aiming for accreditation at this time .
positive	it was very instructive to see him analysing and pointing_out efficiencies .
positive	recommended .
positive	as part of my kitchen_refurb last_year , i put new cupboard_doors on the old units from hh '_s parent_company jmt trade ltd .
positive	i was originally going to reuse the old handles , but after a little_bit of umming and aahing from the other half , i decided to have a look online for the replacements .
positive	i hadn_'_t gone into household handles premises because i just assumed they would be dear .
positive	not so .
positive	when i did find them online , almost accidentally , they were cheaper or similar price as the other_suppliers .
positive	because i had already chatted to them about the doors for ages before i made a decision , i knew they were trustworthy .
positive	so i had no_hesitation in buying once i had seen their prices .
positive	even the part number sticks in my head ... ftd000 traditional pattern knob - i ended_up with 00 of the little tinkers and very happy i was too .
positive	they are good people to do a bit of business with .
positive	highly_recommended .
positive	i had been looking for an oak console_table and matching mirror for ages .
positive	i had spent long hours on the internet and visiting local showrooms all to no_avail - either the mirror proportions or table length didn_'_t fit , or they didn_'_t match each other .
positive	then out of the blue an advert flashed up for a site whose_name sounded ' familiar ' but had never previously appeared in a search .
positive	lo and behold there was a table and mirror from the same suite and both were the perfect size for us .
positive	not only that , the prices were keener than the competition and stock was immediately available - with free , or at_least modest , delivery charges ,
positive	after communicating with the friendly despatch dept .
positive	and agreeing delivery dates and times , the goods actually arrived earlier_than_expected , preceded_by a phone_call from the driver .
positive	the outcome : a nice quality set for the money , a driver who was a great ambassador for his company and a delighted customer .
positive	now looking to see what i can_afford to buy next !
positive	animed_direct offers a wide_range of animal related products , conveniently accessed by animal breed on their easy - to - navigate site .
positive	i '_ve only had to use them for a single product range but they are so much_cheaper_than buying from the vets !
positive	even the vet was impressed by their prices and they provide the prescription proforma too .
positive	buying from the site is simple and quick and the invoicing process is slick and professional .
positive	delivery has always been excellent , both in terms of packaging and speed of service .
positive	favourably impressed .
positive	no_problems with the product or service and outstanding value for money .
positive	prompt delivery , well_packaged and delivered when they said they would .
positive	i hope i don_'_t need to but i feel able to talk to them if a problem arises .
positive	i placed an order only to discover that i ' d bought the wrong item .
positive	as i had used paypal i couldn_'_t suspend payment but instead wrote an e_- mail to dotty_hippo during the evening to try and change the item for the correct one .
positive	i received a very quick response ( after normal business hours ), followed_by a paypal request for the additional_cost and the amended confirmation arrived soon after .
positive	the item arrived very promptly and i was very pleased to have been able to communicate so effectively and have my problem resolved .
positive	this was my first experience of dotty_hippo but i '_m_sure it won_'_t be the last .
positive	the product range looks good and i '_ve already_recommended the company to others .

positive	could not fault it
positive	a friend often said we get out meds online .
positive	being my first dog i kept using the vets but since then i have used best pet and the service especially free_postage ( you cannot underestimate the importance of that to present day customers ) has_been exact .
positive	the web_page looks a little basic i admit and not as fancy as others , but who_cares , i order , it arrives so quickly and i live in the country and i save about 00_% from vet costs .
positive	i have had my dog for 0 years_now and not one order has_been incorrect or more than 0 days arriving .
positive	i wish bigger companies ( even my own ) could say that .
positive	anyway , any negatives ?
positive	i haven_'_t tried prescribed_drugs yet but maybe should as my dog is on about three permanent types .
positive	companies like this should be animal affection driven , and i think this one is .
positive	so well_done to everyone at all levels in this team , thank_you from us , and keep_up the good work .
positive	g gibson and cassie the lurcher .
positive	hi

positive	' life_changing ' maybe a slight_exaggeration but for someone_who was getting seriously fed_up with glasses and contact_lenses .... and the costs , the treatment i had has for me worked really well .
positive	i am ( was ) short_sighted and on the recommendation of optimax only had one eye done , this means that i can still read at short distances plus have near perfect long_distance_vision ..... i have a slightly iffy distance of around 00 cm but you get used to that .

positive	we chose nortlander in the first place out of all of the other travel companies because of how cheap the package was .
positive	also because they were literally the only company to focus on what they could give us rather_than what all the other_companies couldn_'_t do for us i . e .
positive	they didn_'_t bitch about the other_companies and just gave_us the best deal they could .
positive	throughout the semester they helped_us with anything we needed promotion - wise .
positive	emails were replied to almost every time with speed .
positive	when we had to expand the trip from 000 to 000 due to massive sign up numbers , they allowed_us to do so within 0 days of finding out we needed more spaces which took a huge_amount of pressure off us as a committee ( a lot of people were very annoyed that they werent in the first 000 ).
positive	during the trip , all of the reps were well liked by everyone .
positive	noise complaints and situations were handled well .
positive	all events in resort were run as planned and relatively on - time .
positive	overall , from my own experience and from speaking to anyone on the trip , nortlander helped make this the best trip to date for dcu snowsports .
positive	ordered two cat bowls in the shape of fish .

positive	they have competitive_prices and despatch and delivery has always been really prompt .
positive	can '_t ask for anything more than that .
positive	super quick delivery , constantly informed of delivery status . ordered the whey_protein_isolate 00 .
positive	i have found the best way to mix it is with an electric hand blender , if shaken with a protein shaker_bottle you end up with a bottle full of bubbles and froth .
positive	both products are what we as a company required and were well_packeged and delivered in time .
positive	my booking was dead easy online just straight_forward no_hassle ,

positive	the furniture is very good quality , beautifully made , and excellent value .
positive	the only_niggle in the entire_process is that the spanner supplied with the table is laughable , and if that '_s the only thing i can find at fault you know why i gave them 0_stars .
positive	quality product ..... fast delivery ..... and cheapest price i could_find ( cheaper_than ebay !)
positive	without_reservation i recommend this company to you .
positive	the quality of the product is excellent ..... considerably better quality than b_& q and homebase , and way better quality than wickes
positive	the real_bonus though is the fact they are competitively_priced
positive	i will say my planner was a lovely chap steve ) at basildon , but a couple of the other staff were less_than proffessional .
positive	stick with it though , the product is good and very competitive .
positive	great service and value happy to recommend

positive	have ordered supplements from other_companies but this has_been the best service i have received .
positive	brilliant news for sports car buffs , brilliant threads and opportunities to find out about whatever you need to and a real sense of community .
positive	it '_s a great forum for keeping in contact and getting technical_support , blowing off or having a serious debate .
positive	downsides - only one really - a rather incestuous relationship with petrolhead nirvana .
positive	there are other tour companies out there , but the amount of free publicity they get on pistonheads must be worth many tens of thousands of pounds !
positive	when i needed a same day service xerox said they ' d try and do it and never rang me back - fuss 0 had an answer within the hour - how good is that ?
positive	lovely soft towels and very quick delivery - whats not to like ?

positive	believe effective in reducing pain / swelling on knee and very happy i bought it .
positive	well made and designed .
positive	it cools the front of the knee but i have much pain / swelling in the back of the knee and it does not help that at all .

positive	i was having goods delivered to rural scotland and made arrangements to be at home for this .
positive	however the delivery firm arrived a day early when the house was empty .
positive	although the parcel was left with a neighbour , it might have been helpful if the courier had the phone no as well as the address .
positive	i will be returning to buy more for my grandson .
positive	from explaining what our requrements were and recieving advice and recommendations from the ramp_people , to placing the order , delivery within 00_hours was most impressive .

positive	my wife and i have reduced mobility due to sciatic nerve damage for one , and osteo - arthritis in the knee joints for the other .
positive	so we almost stopped using our " traditional " bicycles .
positive	less_than a week_ago , we ordered two powertech foldaway electric communter bikes .
positive	these arrived in perfect_condition within 0 to 0 days - an excellent service .
positive	of course we have only had time for one short road trial , but we feel_confident that these electric bikes will help us get our mobility back , as they are very easy to ride and only require the slightest pressure on the pedals .
positive	and the build quality is superb ; i was really astonished at the solidity of the components , even down to the full length mudguards , very important as we need that transport in all_weathers .
positive	the attention to detail is amazing , including : folding pedals to avoid hitting our leg when pushing the bike , or to avoid damaging doorways when taking the bike indoors , sturdy kickstand with locking_mechanism enabling the bike to be parked on any slope ; hinged saddle to enable the removal of the battery without loosening the seat post , etc .
positive	quite_simply a great bike - and at a very competitive price .
positive	i purchased a dog / car repeller which did not operate correctly .
positive	i wrote to the supplier , but heard_nothing for a few weeks , so decided to phone him .
positive	he immediately set about replacing the item , which arrived two_days_later - and works_fine .
positive	so great service after all .
positive	the microwave i ordered was not only a competitive price but with free delivery and arriving in three_days why_bother scouring the high_street for a deal …. 0_star service thanks

positive	what a first_class company . that provide a first_class job i was so pleased i would recommend brunelengraving to anyone .
positive	i recently was looking for a set of christmas_lights for the family and struggled to find them anywhere .
positive	i stumbled upn festive_lights and found that the site was easy to navigate and each page contained good information on what you require and if you needed a power pack they told you which one was required .
positive	i found the item i required and managed to get it ordered up without_any_problems .
positive	the item was quickly dispatched and reached me very quickly , it actually arrived sooner_than i expected it to .
positive	even the courier used was good because it allowed festive_lights to email me with a rough time the courier would arrive and you could actually go to the couriers website and check where the driver was and what delivery number you were and what delivery number he was on .
positive	the only issue i have is that they may not be the cheapest but if your willing to pay a bit extra for a quality service then i recommend you give them a try .
positive	good products from extensive selection .
positive	didn_'_t have to hang about waiting for delivery .

positive	i don_'_t have a lot of money , and they offer some of the best quality protein around for the price , and it '_s delicious .
positive	i '_ve only bought the original protein in banoffee flavour , which was awful with water and quite nice with milk .

positive	then i think they changed the recipe a bit with the v0 , but they ' re showing more clearly what is in a serving ( e . g .
positive	exact_amount of creatine etc ).
positive	also the new flavour i got was chocolate_peanut_butter caramel .
positive	it '_s pretty tasty but not as nice as the regular chocolate_peanut_butter .

positive	for the past 0 months i have been looking for the perfect ring .
positive	i roughly knew the color clarity and cart i was looking for , but every ring i seen on the high_street was massively over budget .
positive	until i stumbled_across the quality diamonds website .
positive	i must_admit to was a little_apprehensive ordering a ring on the internet but when i designed a ring similar to the many high_street quotes i had i could not believe their prices .
positive	i though surely there must be a catch .
positive	so i started reading the many reviews about quality diamonds and thought this many people can '_t be wrong .
positive	after several nights of comparing the vast_selection of stones available on the qualitydiamonds site i decided to take the plunge and order one .
positive	when it arrived and i opened the the beautiful presentation_box i could not have been happier .
positive	the ring is beautiful , much_better colour and clarity than the ones i had been looking at and up to 00_%_cheaper too .
positive	i checked the gia reference_number against the gia website needless to say the stone is legitimate .
positive	the whole_experience has_been fantastic , from the updates while the ring was being made to the presentation when it arrived .
positive	hopefully my girlfriend will be as impressed as i am .
positive	for all you guys looking for a ring .
positive	go to any decent jewellers and find a ring you like .
positive	ask then to write down the color clarity cut and carat then go home and look for a similar or better stone on quality diamonds .

positive	i had reservations_about selling my old_mobile online to a service such as mazuma but i can happily say that all my concerns were_unfounded .
positive	when i ordered my shiny_new iphone 0 i thought that there would be floods of the old 0g model appearing on ebay so thought i ' d see what mazuma would offer .
positive	i was surprised to see that i would be offered £_000 for my 0 year_old 00gb 0g model .
positive	i set_up an account with mazuma which was a very straight_forward process .
positive	to my surprise , the freepost_envelope arrived at my house the day after i made the sale order with mazuma .
positive	i wrapped my phone in an old jiffy_bag for protection and sent it on it '_s way to be recycled .
positive	the day after being posted i received an email letting_me know my phone had arrived and less_than an_hour later i had another email_telling_me that the order was complete and my cheque was in the post .
positive	i could have opted for a bank_transfer but i personally preferred to receive a cheque .
positive	the day after receiving the email my cheque was waiting on the doorstep when i returned home from work .
positive	the whole_process from signing_up to receiving my cheque took less_than a working week and i cannot_fault a single stage of the process .
positive	my old_iphone had some minor_cosmetic_damage , scratches to case and screen , but this did not affect the value to mazuma .
positive	ebay buyers would have hammered the price down for such wear and tear so i think the price offered by mazuma was outstanding .
positive	given that my new phone cost £_000 i am now in profit and someone_else will get to benefit from my old phone .
positive	i would certainly recommend this service to anyone who has upgraded their phone and wants to sell their old one .
positive	very good value and good quality products , i would recommend using made . com !
positive	easy , quick , good money - all_round win - win_situation !
positive	i recently sent you my old unused n00 ....... amazing 0 days from contacting you a cheque pops through my letterbox ..... amazing mazuma ...... thankyou

positive	ordered a edimax apn from them , which arrived promptly - though the courier delivered it quite late at around 0pm - kudo '_s to him for not turning around to head for home and leaving it for the next_day .
positive	ive purchased from kikatek on quite a few occasions already , but the other day was the first time ive actually had to contact them after a possible bodged firmware_update for the apn i ordered .

positive	the two man crew arrived as promised and were clean , courteous and professional .
positive	what more could we want ?
positive	i find that chemist_direct consistently offers good value on large pack royal_canin dog_foods .

positive	well_structured and easy to use website .

positive	i was searching the web for a gretsch mandolin ; various of the big - name web guitar / music - gear shops showed " call us for availability " but rich_tone showed one in stock ; price including p_&_p was no more than the other stores .
positive	ordered it , arrived within 00_hours , nicely_packaged , lovely instrument .
positive	would very happily buy again from rich_tone in future ; highly_recommended .
positive	ps after i ordered , i went back to rich_tone '_s website to look at the mandolin page again and for the one i ordered it now said " out of stock " -- nice to know that the stock_levels they show on their site are honest & updated so quickly .

positive	don_'_t understand_why the branch can '_t offer the free guarantees though if you quote the internet offer .

positive	brilliant service , free next_day delivery and £_00 cheaper_than elsewhere .
positive	what '_s not to like ?
positive	i was very pleased with the delivery service for the product i ordered .
positive	the ordering_process itself was hassle_free and the product arrived as_described
positive	i recently_purchased some clothing from the end and having_spoken with a member of staff by phone i was able to make an informed choice as to delivery options .
positive	the item was delivered next working day for free without_any_problems .
positive	the range of clothing and the use of less well_known_brands make it an interesting addition to the usual uk_based menswear providers .
positive	viovet '_s commitment to deliver by a certain time the very next_day was a major help for us .
positive	one of our cats is currently being peg fed and we were running short of the hills vet prescription zd formula .
positive	our usual provider responded in time to our order but by mistake delivered the canine equivalent .
positive	despite this being entirely their error , they could not guarantee correcting their error in time to help our cat .
positive	in desperation , we ordered a back up from viovet , which arrived , as promised , before 00pm the next_day .
positive	excellent service .
positive	i had chosen a jacket which unfortunately when it arrived , all in very good time , didn_'_t quite fit ; note the packaging was exceptional , reflecting john_anthony '_s customer_care and dedication to providing a more personal and quality service .
positive	on this occasion i decided the style wasn_'_t what i was looking for and i returned the item .
positive	the process was simple to follow , the store was quick to acknowledge my returned order and i was reimbursed shortly_afterwards .
positive	to summarise i would say that my experience of ordering on - line with john_anthony '_s provided a level of care and attention that is often missing from internet_shopping sites .
positive	signed
positive	a happy customer :-)
positive	top quality , suculent vape juice !!

positive	i totally messed_up my order online ; then i bought the wrong bag ( which they let_me have even_though it was £_00 more than the one i had originally ordered .)
positive	i then had to return it and re - ordered the bag i should have selected in the first place !
positive	throughout this saga of my own making , they remained completely focused on giving me the bag i needed , the manager even emailing me on her weekend days off .
positive	although they probably will be glad never to have me buy from them again , i would recommend them to anyone ; great prices and first_class service .
positive	first things first .
positive	it was very easy to identify the memory i needed and then to order .
positive	i didn_'_t need to know whether i needed sodimm or whatever - simply enter details of the make and model of the laptop and the website tells you what you need and the maximum_ram possible for that model .
positive	delivery was very swift and accurate - what more do you need .
