neutral	i used to work on ecommerce sites with custom shopping carts that integrated with numerous payment processors , at an internet company that itself sold services online .
negative	called the company only to be told its a match ticket and that satisfies the order ???
neutral	i noticed there was a " blue water light " on and the saleswoman told me it was just the brights . she was wrong . it is the coolant light .
neutral	i then needed to supply id after they had recieved the package , and the cheque was mailed to me two_days_later . the only part i have a problem with is that it has_been 0 business days and the cheque is still not cleared .
positive	would defiantly use this again .
negative	which was okay , i figured i could just send it back and receive a new one quickly .

neutral	continued checking during this time always showed the same message ; “ electronic information received ”.
negative	and i won_'_t hold my breath !
neutral	i found it very easy to use and skypax notifies me via_email when they receive a package .
negative	with no confirmation of delivery time by 0000 today , i googled a complaint number and enjoyed being put on wait for 00_minutes of my company '_s time ( i '_m self - employed ), during which time i was fed such dishonest propaganda as , " our faster , most reliable services ".

negative	i waited for a few_minutes expecting another assistant to be notified of my existence .
neutral	thanks for your attention .
positive	its an odd policy to display a higher price which is then discounted at check out - a quick check can appear not to be the cheapest option .

negative	i had reserved the car for 00am .
negative	being that they sent me a defective product they should stand_behind their equipment and at_least cover the cost of shipping just out of mere inconvenience .

neutral	the daily spending_limit has no relation to history spending i want to buy more than 00_usd and by introducing this concept of limiting the daily spending it '_s like telling a customer sorry you can only buy this jacket and you have to come tomorrow for the t - shirt and after for the socks etc .
negative	the quality of the cards was ok , but not worth the cost .
neutral	advertised wrong on the website !!
positive	ordered new shower_head , arrived quickly and very well_packaged .

neutral	while the price initially of renting a car is competitive the practice of paying for a full_tank of fuel ( which you may not use ) up front at exorbitant rates per_litre and return as empty as possible is a rather devious means of increasing the overall price of the rental .
negative	internet could be down with more than 00_hours without resolution .
neutral	took me a little_bit to get around and understand what i was paying for .
negative	please_note - this is the first review i have ever given , so that should tell you a lot on the quality of service received - which is none .
negative	it was just free to flop around in the carton .
negative	this site has no costumer_service available at all .
negative	when i emailed customer service they did not try to work with me to get the parts , they told me i will get a refund for the parts but still will be charged the shipping and they would not resend the items because they cannot pay another $ 0 to re - ship it .
negative	so , i have to email again stating that the picture clearly shows on the website 0 total knobs ( the 0 larger ones and the four small ones ) and i include my phone_number and request that a service rep call me .
negative	the first one had problems with the parts of the fleece falling_off .
negative	in calling the company they told me they would send another pair but would not expedite them without me paying the overnight fee .

positive	for someone_who usually buys his ales in the local_shops it was most refreshing to go to a website and find long forgotten ales , the temptation was to keep adding to the basket and let the bill rise to crazy amounts but i stopped at 00 amazing bottles of ale , i was more amazed to find in under 00_hours the ales were in my front_porch ready for me to enjoy !

positive	the website is easy to navigate , the service is quick - excellent service - but the questionnaire is really annoying : i have a repeat order of specialised food for my cat - and its tedious that the the website cannot remember the answers from the last order .
neutral	had i known that i would not have been receiving them in the deferred delivery date order i would have asked for immediate shipment to ensure i received them .

positive	the online live_chat service of product information and general customer service is reliable and very helpful .

positive	!
neutral	meant to be cream but was white that had been sprayed very badly , if i ' d had more time i would have sent it back not a good advert !!!
neutral	personally , i don_'_t think i should have to pay extra for this , seeing that you offer " free_shipping " - another statement not quite on the mark - very much in line with your coupons .

neutral	but this week , i was shopping for side_mirrors .
neutral	we decided to take_advantage of the 0 free month .
negative	they replaced the cracked lcd with another screen that did not fit and was literally separating from the phone when i got it back - you could see light coming from all of the edges and it popped off the phone completely if you applied pressure not to mention that the gaps allowed dust in which clouded the edges of the screen as well as the camera !!

negative	i got the number from the hotel webpage and thought i was talking to the hotel .
neutral	when i tried to use it on this site something went horribly wrong -- fields were filled incorrectly , and then i couldn_'_t select them to edit .
neutral	i wish i had read the reviews before ordering as it seems to be a consistent theme .
negative	i was given a bunch of malarky from your c / s dept .
positive	but because they keep you so well informed through mail , i noticed it soon enough .
negative	this is not a safe place , this neighborhood is riddled with druggies and thieves .
neutral	no time given , no phone_call when the delivery failed , the huge stress trying to sort something out for the unplanned delivery and unpaid day off work for my husband , all for nothing !
neutral	when i opened the box the bag was empty the whole bag had ripped open on the bottom of the bag .
neutral	hopefully your order will arrive soon , but , if you need your beauty fixes quicker , be sure to use our next_day service in future '.
positive	great company to do_business with .
negative	a little more one on one with customers
neutral	it seems that the attachment screw system was stripped and the plastic nut was broken .

neutral	i ordered an air_filter for a 0000_chevy express that came in it '_s own shippable cardboard_box but then partsgeek , i presume , put it in an even bigger box which i believe made it even more_expensive to ship .
positive	they arrived_promptly and i was emailed so i could track .

neutral	at the hotel , he again expected us to move our 0 pieces of luggage and my walker from the van over to the sidewalk ( a distance of about 0 - 00 feet ) without assistance from him .
neutral	on top of that , express_deals are limited and i have notice that some express_deals are actually lower in price ( according to %_discount ) than actually bidding .
negative	management at the hostel appeared to be apologetic , but did nothing about the issue
positive	delivery .

neutral	most of the parts i ordered were fine , but some had no accessories like the nuts for one of my stabilizer links and one of my ball_joints had a threaded stud and a unthreaded stud . the list shows that the brake_pad for a 0000 camry le 0 . 0 and a xle 0 . 0 have the same pad , which is not correct , i have a 0000 xle 0 . 0 and the pads and rotor are bigger than the 0 . 0 . i need to return brake_pads , rotor , and control_arm .

neutral	i told her to just leave my reservation stand , and i would book another way .
neutral	to : parts_geek , llc
neutral	both had the correct zip .
neutral	the company we have been buying our air_filters from for several_years is no_longer selling residential .

positive	easy 0_star from me
neutral	there is so little detail and the pictures so poor it is going to be of minimal use , i '_m very disappointed to say the least .
neutral	it just got in time eventhough i have to say that i did not get too much feedback from outdoor_shop nor the courier parcel_force when i was trying to track up my order .
positive	i would never have found or tried auto - europe if it hadn_'_t been for a good friend who told me that he had had nothing but great experiences with the company at prices that were less_than larcenous .
positive	i can '_t get this product any more from my grocer so was very happy to find it online and cheaper !

positive	our pet_store is in the next town , so having our order delivered is such a luxery .
positive	i ordered a tail_light_assembly for a nissan_titan 0000 and it fit_perfectly .
neutral	the prices are definitely the best on the web with many closeout_deals on high end brands of supplements , however , the shipping_costs are outrageous and they have a big thing allover the site about a low or free shipping scam from other_companies , but i used to use ebay a lot and shipping a product that is compact and weighs 0lbs does not costs $_00 .
neutral	but i do think the shirt is still cute and i do plan on wearing it .
neutral	unfortunately i was unable to find a gas_station near the car_rental return location ( twice ) and had to pay more than double the going rate for gas .
positive	to top it off , on the back of my note was a coupon towards my next order .
neutral	although in this instance that was unfortunate , the fact that the items were dispatched and delivered so quickly showed excellent service .
positive	very friendly and obliging people both who collected and delivered the car .
positive	bh_photo is my trusted photographic_equipment supplier .
negative	i accepted waiting more .
neutral	they did send me my hard_drive back after they decided they didn_'_t want to repair it and its been 0_weeks and the reimbursement has not shown up .

positive	good prices , very fair shipping rates and delivery times go a long way to help keep things smooth .
positive	very good service , lenses quality very good .
neutral	now , its all over the place and not really that good .
negative	the company did not fill my order until the following business day , tuesday 00 / 00 / 0000 .
neutral	so overall impression is ok ( very bad as for the service at the desk and pretty good for the car itself and the drop - off ).
negative	[ continue with canned response here ]."
positive	i love to shop @ amiclubwear , the store always have sales coupons for additional %_off on their merchandise , great fashion for great price , super_fast shipping and really good deals !!!!!!!!!
negative	i was very dissatisfied with the return process .
neutral	to call and make a cancellation nor do they accept cancellations .
neutral	there would be a delay on the cooker , but i asked for the fridge_/_freezer to be delivered as soon as possible and not to wait for the cooker .
positive	al bisogno , comprerò ancora da questo_sito .
positive	it boils down therefore to price ( delivered ), availability and speed of delivery .
neutral	after 0 working days i decided to chase about the order in case items were out of stock .
negative	then still no gglasses so i call again and was told the frames were lost so they had to reorder them .
neutral	also , you cannot book a hostel the same day , which can become a hassle .

neutral	hmm , i have nothing against minivans , but for family of 0 without much baggage and a desire to leave a small carbon footprint , i asked the desk person if i could actually downgrade and get a compact instead .
negative	do not use very poor !!"
neutral	disappointing . but
positive	i have never even thought of swapping suppliers .
neutral	i have ordered from them many_times .
positive	and they look great .
negative	our travelocity itinerary said that we were flying on aeromexico at 0pm .
neutral	the whole proccess is not customer friendly . i shouldnt have to do any more than simply report the issues , then you do the rest . i would also have thought that your quality control would have been a bit more stringent . it would put me off any future_purchases unfortunately , and there are other items we need .
positive	as it included all costs and there were to be no extra surprises when we arrived we went_ahead .
positive	i ordered light housing for my accord after shopping several sites on the internet .
positive	highly_recommended .

neutral	had e_-_mail indicating they needed me to contact them about order due to having issues with my credit_card , then found that the credit_card did get billed , but haven_'_t been able to call due to their 0 am to 0 pm limited calling time span .
negative	total time wasters avoid at all costs !!!
positive	i bought a rockshox reverb seatpost at an amazing price too good to pass up and the service i recieved was second to none well_done to merlin . simply the best
positive	b_&_h had the product !
neutral	pick_up a little easier and no dragging cases onto buses .
positive	most of them are stacked together for the price of just one of the supplements supplied by the company that makes them .
negative	:\
negative	the courier delivered a parcel but unfortunately for me the wrongly addressed parcel . left a phone message at deep_blue which appears to have fallen on deaf_ears no phone contact or apology .

negative	no matter where i went this part number you sent me never came up for my vehicle ,
positive	my blemishes are disappearing .
neutral	really satisfied with the quick delivery of the items , however , when we sent them back because they didn_'_t fit it took over three_weeks to get a confirmation_email and then another week before the refund , meaning a total of four weeks !
negative	and let them keep their damn part !!!
neutral	custom phone support is poor and not very friendly , cards came out great and work just as stated , but dont plan on getting service or support from them .
positive	the original futon frame , drawers and matching table are as good as they were 00 years_ago .

neutral	hope it will " get better " .
negative	i was saved a lot of stress and frustration and will never use this second - rate scam service ever again .
positive	0 år kan_man virkelig se de fulde resultater af deres vejledning , behandlinger og skønne produkter .
negative	no human_being ever picked_up the phone and the system kicked me off without letting_me leave a message .
negative	no need to ever go back there .
neutral	parts_geek is great unless you need customer service !
negative	why so long ?
negative	!
neutral	if not , maybe purchase via amazon - as perhaps some extra customer_support from the amazon side , if things go wrong .
positive	would use again .
positive	this has not been the first time i used partsgeek .
positive	all in all a good experience , and i shall_certainly use them next time .
positive	i will use them again .
positive	the price was the best price i found on the internet .
neutral	i filled_out a cs ticket and received a generic response .
neutral	it was just devastating to go through all of this work and this entire_process to then learn that business logos are not allowed on your gift_cards !
neutral	it was if the box was old or not designed to hold the weights they were packing in it , and had lost some of its integrity on the seams .
neutral	i am so thankful that i checked or else this would '_ve been a disaster !!!!
neutral	the online experience was a bit frustrating .
positive	will recommend and use again :-)
neutral	sent the tiles back asking for a smaller wagon which duly_arrived but this driver refused to come up the drive .
negative	it would cost me almost $_00 . 00 to ship back one cv_axle and hub assy and you still don_'_t know if you '_ll get your original money back .
neutral	apparently the flowers arrived way later than ten am even_though i i paid for that delivery option .
negative	i ordered in good time and received confirmation they would be received on the due date .
neutral	there was no note from the delivery so i assume it left the company that way .

positive	return trips for 00 mi & 000 mi torque checks were handled very efficiently !
positive	brilliant , will come_back again .
negative	public_storage offered no_recourse or restitution other that " we ' re sorry it happened ".
negative	alex assured me they were different and they would do proper qc on my drives before being shipped .
neutral	i can find what i want at b_&_h and prices are competitive with amazon , but shipping is slow and expensive !
neutral	i rang very immediately and the item was not handed in for weeks by that person , so he did try to keep £_000 worth of goods .
negative	the photo of the correct evaporator was shown so i ordered that part .
neutral	process worked ok , but driver delivering vehicle back was an_idiot .
positive	i buy from bulkpowders . co . uk , because their prices are good , the value of the supplements are high , and there '_s free delivery to a number of eu countries with purchases over £_000 .
positive	your on - line staff was very helpful and took an interest in my suggestion on looking into another additional food that i suggested .

positive	i would definitely recommend this site to a friend !

positive	the service was amazing , price was good and customer_service staff were very friendly and helpful .
negative	never again .
negative	understandably , the driver would not let any additional passengers on board .
negative	i wanted to make_sure they did not give our room away for the second night because of our late check in .

positive	since a ) i didn_'_t have opportunity to do that and b ) it would cost me quite a bit , i decided to look online for a source .
neutral	unsure if i '_ll buy from them again , not a satisfied customer buying experience , customer_support etc
neutral	you accept money from customers , but you do not provide a conduit to facilitate correcting errors with the credit_reporting agencies .

positive	i have booked my hotels with as little as three hours notice and still everything was never an issue .

neutral	the price was pretty good .
neutral	but pure_health did deliver on time but the poduct dosn '_t work .
neutral	it typically takes 00 - 00 days for me to receive items .
negative	første og sidste_gang_jeg køber der .
negative	when i got mad , they asked what color my charge card was and gave_me a number based on the color of my card .

negative	code didn_'_t work .
positive	both cars in the family have a hatch bag , we wouldnt be without one .
neutral	shipped by fedex who works with the usps to reduce costs .
negative	they also do not tell you when an item will ship when you order say , 00 items , and only 0 arrive .
neutral	i have yet to receive proper required number and instructions for return although my continued requested have been ignored .
neutral	this was not duty or taxes , but as far as i could tell just for ups to make some extra money .
negative	!
positive	order was placed over the internet on a very easy to use site .
negative	so , i checked the next_day and still it was listed as pending .

neutral	!
positive	i highly_recommend this storage_facility .
negative	i told him it was sad that knowing i would never be back that to him losing only one customer in the realm of all the other unexpecting customers he could care less .
neutral	i called pf that night ( 0 days ago ) and left a voicemail with specific information_regarding the issue and order details .
positive	kevin was very helpful in helping_me identify the part i needed - efficient and professional .
neutral	i have used uni_baggage before and there was no_problems , but this time when i got my suitcase it was extremely dirty , this is why i only rated it 0_stars , apart_from that there wasn_'_t any other problems .

neutral	i '_ve helped out in my uncles florist for years so maybe i just have really high_standards .
neutral	the two negatives are : every thursday_night when i fly back into newark , i call them for pickup .
positive	delivery time was also very impresive - the pens arrived within two_days of my order .
positive	the product descriptions are very thorough and written in a friendly tone by people who clearly know what they are talking_about .
negative	!
negative	why .
neutral	not once has anyone ever managed to phone the day before .
negative	therefore , i can only assume that when the ordered car is not available , the policy is to first get the customer to pay for an upgrade rather_than admit the error ?
negative	one really crazy example that comes to mind is that they will teach you that rejäla means savory .
neutral	but when i find a deal , like the one i thought i was using when i started with petflow , i expect to actually see the results .
neutral	the charge was not authorized nor was i informed they were going to do this .
neutral	the part number was correct for the application , but either the original manufacture mixed it up or parts_geek did .
positive	;-) thank_you !
positive	they picked_up the box from my house and two_days_later the money was in my paypal_account .
negative	i tried explaining to him that the information was not correct and the computer locked me out as not to update my information .

positive	i had ordered a window sill propagator and it was just what i wanted although i had ordered it for my daughters partner .
negative	it is a total scam and definitely not worth the extra money .
positive	but i like it for quickness of getting my stuff sent and no cranky morons to awkward you out of the store .
negative	paul , the employee on the phone reservation , called the hotel , and then told me yes , that hotel would allow an 00 year_old to check in by himself .
negative	p ** pa * needs to be shut the hell down .
neutral	all other upgrades have increased in price much the same way .
positive	i can_depend_on pet_flow to fill my order as scheduled so there aren_'_t any concerns of upsets over changes in food for one of my dogs that has a sensitive digestive_system .
neutral	the only_criticism i have of deep_blue was in trying to get through to enquire and purchase an item .
positive	i love the quality of the clothes , shoes , and basically everything .
neutral	simple explanations for these 0 items with assurance of quality and fair shipping_charges and explanation of such will make my experience with partsgeek very good and deserving of 0_stars if next order deals with these issues .
negative	after calling many_times the excuse was they had changed hands and needed the prescription again which was on file !!
positive	sadie and sophie will not be dissappointed at dinner time .
neutral	i was assured that the confirmation would be given when the type of car could be confirmed that i had ordered .

neutral	i went back to the dealership today 0 / 00 / 0000 and the car was purchased 0 / 00 / 0000 and they told us there was nothing that can be done .
positive	i was looking online for a storage_facility for my college daughters dorm boxes .
negative	helen danel customer # 0000000000
neutral	i '_m not sure that it was worth the money paid ; it would have been very good value for a patterned hard cover , but not for what it actually is .
neutral	arrive for flight at 0am and had to wait at_least 00_mins in sub zero temperatures to hand my car over .
neutral	even_though i got a further discount to bring the price down to 00 . 00p , i got a quote from a local company for 00 . 00p .
neutral	when someone tries to slide extra fees in on the backside of the deal .
neutral	also , we buy canned_cat_food from petflow and it '_s annoying that it only comes in large boxes of a single flavor .
positive	easy to use site great turnaround shopping will use again .
neutral	we didn_'_t like having to leave the terminal in phoenix and then re - enter a different terminal in order to catch our connecting_flight .
positive	mix is very picky when it comes to chew treats , so i figured i ' d try these bully_sticks that everyone is raving_about .
negative	my trouble with this company started almost_immediately .
neutral	결제 전 확인할 수 있게끔 한 번 더 보여 준다면 더 편하게
negative	the product was broken and when i called to report it i was told to take a picture of the broken part and email it in .
neutral	since i didn_'_t hear from the recipient that the flowers had arrived , i emailed serenata direct and had them trace the order .
negative	i waited anxiously for that package and it was fustrating thinking the package wasn_'_t going to make it and that i would lose $_000 .
neutral	it wasn_'_t awful , but it did distort the look of the fonts we purchased for this brand which matters .
positive	i would recommend bookit . com to anyone !
negative	they never shipped my order , and then when i tried to contact them nobody_answers the phone .
neutral	i will stick to ebay or amazon for now on , just because your shipping is too slow .
positive	i use them for all my spa_supplies .
negative	i will be sure to submit as many reviews as possible to let others know to steer_clear of this website .
positive	considering the lower price , and good reviews on taste of the coffee , we would have loved to have used the capsules from fine_coffee club .
negative	!
negative	i agreeade .
positive	as_described
neutral	i '_ve used boiler_juice many_times and it has_been 00 / 00 service - this time the attitude of the driver let them down !

positive	i love b_&_h '_s easy - to - use website and very professional staff .
negative	not true when i was shuttle to the airport rental every company was there except economy .
neutral	the refund took a week or two to come through when i sent the item back and i was given the write amount when refunded .
negative	the website has the potential to be great , but the fact that it '_s littered with mistakes makes it useless .
neutral	nice hotel but the restaurant was not very good .
negative	the incurred loss is well over $ 0 , 000 !!!
neutral	i like the quality of you clothes happy with purchase
neutral	and the idea of getting a $_00 . 00 refund for ordering over b $_000 . 00 is very misleading
negative	i '_ve tried ordering from them at 0 different times .
negative	i ordered three pairs of trainers only one arrived i have to email a few_times to get the order sorted .
negative	i ordered a virtual visa_gift_card as a birthday_gift and it was a nightmare .
positive	they emailed me first , called me first , and sent me free_samples ( cross - country ) in 0 days .
negative	i sent it back and emailed them , emphasizing that i expected my refund to include shipping as it was their mistake .
negative	the 000 # is a joke .
neutral	it took over 0 months for the item i ordered to be shipped .
neutral	if that option was there i did not see it or its not visable enough to add to cart .
negative	mr d . munt

positive	excellent service delivered on time .
neutral	also the fact that you don_'_t aggregate reviews / take into account number of reviews as_opposed to making somebody with 0 ( 0_star ) reviews is higher_than someone with 00 , 000 0 / 0_star reviews .
neutral	probably wouldnt order again based on this .

positive	a very good delivery and product service
positive	this store is awesome along with their other store , yesstyle . com !
neutral	log on now to spread the word .
neutral	i used the website to pick out my tires and set_up my appointment .
positive	except for the customer_satisfaction survey which demands 00 words and made me have to ponder as to whence 00 words purveyed a more quintessentially expressive delivery beyond that which is contained within " top banana "
positive	great value for money .
neutral	my problem is that exchanging my old parts ( core ) for a refund requires filling_out a customer service form , several emails , and several days to get an_rma_number .
positive	their attention to detail is spot on .
neutral	i looked on the michaelkors website and could not see the watch i purchased .
positive	b_&_h , over many_years , has earned mine .

negative	if you go to their site and look for shoes for your size only and try to purchase it your size may not be available even_though your only suppose to be seeing shoes in that size .
positive	recommended very highly
neutral	or have the sales_associate come check in with the customer to give them an new estimate or just keep them in the loop about the work being done and why its taking longer_than estimated .
negative	have another tech at the house today and he seems to not know either .
neutral	tak for en_god handel :)
neutral	i simply charged the phones and both immediately worked - i would have thought envirophone could have worked this out for themselves .
neutral	i was billed_twice for the same day after enrolling on line for parking .
negative	i talked to a supervisor and she said that that reservation had gone into a guest account for some_reason and the agent hadn_'_t followed protocol to determine whether or not i had a flight reservation .

negative	horrible customer_service .
positive	the clinic offered to provide a private_prescription (£ 00 each ) but we paid just £_00 for the online consulation fee ( one charge for 0 people ) on the travelpharm website .
neutral	delivery . com sends out a lot of $ 0 and $ 0 coupons which are great .
neutral	i have tried to contact and send pictures and i have received inadequate responses .
positive	good price , no_problems .
neutral	after this , i '_m not sure that forever 00 is as horrible as the poor depictions of it on the internet .

neutral	sorry i haven_'_t used the ink_cartridge yet , however i '_m due to use it very soon .
neutral	not sold it is 000_% real but i guess that is what i get for paying $_000 less_than what these watches go for .
negative	be aware , the entire company has one single stuck up customer rep , becky_s . she is the manager , she is the care , she is the only person_who you would end up with .
positive	wow , that was fast !
negative	i will never ever use this company again !
positive	excellent service !

negative	installed both .
neutral	the room was spacious , clean and quiet .
negative	my card never arrived , which was supposed to be a present for my cousin for her bridal_shower .
positive	thank_you to him , and to a company that understands the importance of outstanding customer_service .
neutral	other than that , everything else seemed easy .
negative	its an e ticket which is supposed to be emailed to me and they are usually sent immediately after order confirmation .
negative	do not touch with a bargepole !!!!!!
negative	so instead of potential client for future , they have earned a bad review instead .
positive	i was out the door in under 00_minutes with a set of tires which , so_far , i '_m happy with .
neutral	the first time i got a satisfactory answer , very politely given .
negative	now bare root roses are out of season so a replacement rose plant will now cost me three_times as much with shipping .
positive	this is much faster and smoother than the normal off airport_parking and at these comparable prices will become the ' way to go ', especially if you ' re short on time to catch your plane .
positive	they have always provided fast shipping .
neutral	so when i tried to use it , my purchase was charged to my sons account which caused a lot of hard feelings .
neutral	i have already enquired_about the status of the parts and i was simply told they would check with the warehouse .
neutral	not being_able to select guest numbers straight_away wastes too much time

positive	would use again .
positive	great fit for cycling ., and super high visibility .
negative	not so happy my order still has not shipped .
neutral	whilst the website is well_constructed and clearly has a close engagement with most if not all hotels and hostels in the desired city i was visiting , i had minor greviances with issues of a more practical manner .
positive	i received it on thursday_morning and have to say that i '_m impressed with the quick service from shopto . net and would recommend that others shop there .
positive	nothing like getting some silent time when you have 0 dogs .
negative	i was never notified via_email or any other means that the order had been cancelled .
negative	when i did get around to installing , it connected perfectly and came up correctly , however once the bezel was clipped back in place , the screen displayed an irregular pattern .
neutral	:) :)
neutral	ordered my lights , only received half the order .
positive	i ordered my coat one day and received it early the next_morning .
positive	the ss slimmers fb_page is excellent for asking questions & getting advice & ideas .
neutral	apparently_delilah_b . and her manager were supportive of this group '_s agenda as they also helped them secure a more_expensive room with a different host and donated this guest about $_00 to book a room with the other airbnb_host ( and they collected the fees from the other host as well in addition to mine ).
neutral	contact the seller and see if they have a dedicated customer service , check how fast the respond to your question , if it '_s over 0 days to respond , don_'_t deal with them , check their history and check their feed_back that have actual comments from buyer .
positive	after completing my order i contacted them to add an_additional item to qualify for the free delivery via_email , and i got a quick and helpful response from their customer_service team who both called and emailed me to assist .
positive	thrilled with the outcome and the delivery time .

positive	customer service was great !
positive	the items i needed were in stock and came to me nicely_packaged and in a very reasonable ammount of time .
neutral	as what the delivery men had to do in our case was pushing a " single " big box along in our lounge and that was it !!
positive	they arrived , well_packed and in a great little case and felt " right " from the start .
negative	he was speaking another language to a co - worker and again i spoke louder into the phone to get someone '_s attention and asked for someone to speak_english .
neutral	if i like the service , i '_ll use it again .
negative	it took me almost a month to return the damaged item and receive a replacement from the german vendor .
negative	i was able to order the exact_same product from another company with no problem .
negative	she had to receive her gift a few_days late this year .
neutral	he supposedly made notation in system .
neutral	ordered a fridge_/_freezer and cooker .
positive	highly_recommend this site to all of my friends and fellow hockey players .
positive	first off , when you enter the website , the initial page where you enter your destination and date ranges is very easy to use .
neutral	i might use the service again but i '_ll probably check if anyone_else is offering it .
neutral	not problem though as the old attachment arm worked out well .
negative	idiot !!!
positive	the service i recieved was very very good .
neutral	when i see a item in stock online i expect it to be in stock .
negative	immediately i requested the wimdu to cancel , as i am travelling with elderly people .
positive	which was fine , i went on thinking ignorance was bliss and never sure if i would ever need squaretrade for future_purchases , as i seemed to take_care of my things .
negative	i called talk to customer_service rep , she transferred me to manager phone , left message , no call back .
positive	de k & t medewerkster meldde daarop uit zichzelf dat_ze deze zending wel in twee delen kon sturen , zodat het zeker zou_zijn dat_ik het mes op_tijd zou hebben .
neutral	the auto - ship service is a great idea , and i appreciate being_able to have raw diet foods delivered to my doorstep , especially_considering that they ' re virtually unavailable locally .
neutral	all of this and having to call defeated the whole idea of the simplicity of ordering online .
positive	their response was quick and informative and they kept me apprised the whole time .
positive	the material , lining and hanging rails are superb .
positive	but hostelworld , for my money , is the best of the bunch .
negative	but while waiting and believe me it was around 00_mins i decided to contact the support again .
positive	i bought some net_curtains a few_months_ago in my local town and then the shop closed down so i couldn_'_t get matching nets for the rest of the house but i went on the woodyatt site and lucky_enough they had the exact_same curtain and i have to say the service i received from them was an awful lot quicker_than that which i received from my local shop .
neutral	i will use again .
negative	i am now going to contact bbb and days inn to try and resolve this issue .
positive	so 00 years on i just bought my second harrington .
positive	!
negative	" how about a hello how are you today , what can help you with !"
neutral	i think cars could be better priced and i wonder_if they actually service the cars .
negative	he was made to pay again he was told his online ticket was invald .
neutral	cute . for a stripper ;)
neutral	ordered a very pretty silver twig tree , finally plumped for the 00cm one , when assembled it looked exactly as the photograph but very short !!!
neutral	the social_security office said they wouldn_'_t accept it either , and luckily had a spanish speaking staff_member to translate when we arrived .
positive	packaging was solid and well made .
positive	a fantastic service , i will be back again and again !
negative	i have still not received my items .
positive	reasonable price .
negative	i have purchased every plan ticket for work and social travel through_travelocity for a decade .
positive	as a bonus baja is next door .
negative	they are to manufactured to specifications and do not even fit in the unit .
neutral	after 0 hours i had to ask about the estimated time for completion .
negative	and for the bags order two months_ago , i never even received the first shipment , and emailed customer_service , they were nice to resend the items , which got to me in 0 - 0 days versus their poor shipping service this time around .
neutral	old review below
positive	my email was immediately answered which was followed by a call .
negative	i started this whole_process in may it is now the end of august still no glasses , am i happy , not , will i use or recommend this company , never !!!
negative	avoid this website .
neutral	mike
negative	it '_s funny that i should get this email about how much you care about your customer '_s experience , considering that after i received my order , i sent you an_email_stating how pathetic the plants were , and received absolutely no response .
neutral	i was annoyed at having been out 0 bucks for the time being , but pleasantly_surprised to find that i could actually receive it .
negative	therefore he was going to go_ahead with the request to review the original call and i should hear something in about 0 - 0 days .
neutral	always call the facility you ' re placing a reservation with to confirm your unit before you go to do paperwork , and double_check their hours while you have them on the phone .
neutral	the pricing and ease of ordering and the reminders to reorder is great .
neutral	very high cost for product including shipping .
neutral	i would pay shipping twice , plus a 00_% restock_fee , and 00_minutes of my time waiting on the phone for a $_00 part .
positive	so i put them away for special treats .
positive	the communication from dino and their courier was first_class and accurate .
positive	yesstyle has many different_brands from asia with high_quality goods .
negative	!
neutral	however when i compare my experience with friends it seems that envirofone takes a lot longer to process your payment .
neutral	size details should be more helpful .
neutral	with no expiation or common curiosity of an_apology i left pretty disappointed as everything else was impressive .
negative	all characters were entered correctly .
positive	i turned_up , left my keys , came back after 00_minutes and my car was outside all ready to go .
neutral	he did not tell me he wasn_'_t affiliated with hilton / hampton inns .
neutral	he was very patient with my many questions , and i did book a room for three_nights , and paid in full .
neutral	here is my wish_list for the website :
neutral	ordering on - line was easy and straightforward .
positive	love the prices and free_shipping !
negative	then they would charge you money to have your phone sent back !
neutral	however , their e_- mail customer_service is non_- existent ; e_- mails go completely unanswered .
negative	picked_up after 0 days , rebooked 0 times , had very upset client .
neutral	when i made my new purchase i still did not receive any shipping information either an_email with the order confirmation .
negative	paid for a unlock service 0 months_ago and they haven_'_t done anything .
negative	note_: ate this point , they already have your money !!
negative	i talked to the supervisor and asked him to review the recorded conversation from the last time i called to fix what the previous the problem that the representative have caused .
positive	thank_you .
positive	i have used multiple websites over the years to purchases supplements .
neutral	i do however like the price difference_between the two , thank_you !
positive	delivery was fast and product was good quality .
neutral	i get that you provide a good service , and have to make your buck , goldstar .
negative	even_though the site read in big caps that everything was in stock , nothing was in stock .
neutral	it seems they are good untill you hit a problem , then there customer_service goes out the ewindow , a phone_number would be great !
positive	wonderful booking - fast , simple , efficient !
positive	i also received some freebies with my order !
neutral	everything i ordered was delivered present & correct but delivered late .
positive	add to that the fast shipping , and well_designed site ; and you get a fabulous experience .
positive	parts came in a timely_manner .
neutral	not only does supplementwarehouse have quick shipping and the lowest_prices , they have the largest_selection in supplements i have ever_seen .
positive	it '_s so quick as well - after ordering , they arrived the next_day !
negative	i hope people read these stories in the future , i wish i had before i used these fraudsters !
neutral	the rental was supposed to be all_inclusive , insurance included .
neutral	when the truck finally arrived ( 0wks after they were supposed to be here - truck broke_down etc etc ) they were not able to drive around to my unit .
neutral	not sure if they just used a flimsier product for the sale price , but they were so thin they couldn_'_t have weighed more than a heavy cardstock business card .
negative	the girl that picks_up is nice .
negative	wish i could take the jeep back , cancel my contract and take my money to buy a new one somewhere_else that actually cares .
neutral	ordering tyres on line and having someone come to fit them is a great idea , but the service let it down .
neutral	i would not use this resourse again .
positive	i have come to rely_on petflow for my pets food and treats .
neutral	the desk_clerk held our_luggage and gave_us suggestions on where to go to eat .
negative	if these issues are not resolved soon i will cancel service and credit_card payments .
positive	so_far , so very good .
neutral	hope they sort it out !
negative	two_weeks of going back and forth and still don_'_t have the correct part number or any indication of if it has_been sent .
negative	this is my worst experience with doheny '_s yet .
neutral	the day i received my order i received a call from them wanting me to switch to automatic delivery .
negative	they were '_t rude , but i ordered a book for my patent law class and did the search under a very specific isbn_number and my receipt even states the isbn_number .
neutral	this review is hard for me to write .
negative	i tried to get compensation for their ignorance but only got responses saying " thank_you for your feedback . "
negative	then , after waiting two_weeks to receive my order , nobody contacted me to tell me that my items were out of stock .
neutral	however , one of the collars was broken , and there didnt seem to be any return directions in the package .
positive	everything worked out perfectly .
negative	you allowed_me the pleasure of finding exactly_what replacement laptop i wanted to buy , because when you finally agreed to pay out my claim , you sent the wrong dollar_amount , and i had even more time to shop because i waited even more days , for you to send additional compensation ,
neutral	the recipient waited in all day .
neutral	delivery was fast but navigating the site was a hassle .
positive	i '_ve used olotels once in the past and both_times everything worked without a hiccup at the hotel .
neutral	it '_s possible also that when i signed_up that i may have made some mistakes in the filtering process as well .
positive	my 0 kids , my wife and i use these pillows .
negative	time went by . a few_weeks_later , the glasses finally showed_up along with the full charges on my credit_card .
positive	also double wrapped for protection .
neutral	frames should not state they are compatible with progressive_lenses if they are not .
positive	it arrived in just a few quick days and had no problem with any part i received .
positive	i '_ve already_recommended petflow to several friends .
negative	i said friday please .
positive	i have used raw_gaia '_s sundried green clay face pack for several_years_now it is absolutely the best mask one can find !
neutral	she assured me the cards were on their way so maybe this is premature as the last two have not been received yet .
negative	to make it even better , if the part is faulty after installation . too bad , too sad for the consumer !
positive	our order was received promptly and was satisfactorily filled .
positive	i went to all of my local_stores looking for a regulator and no one had one and could not order one either .
neutral	probably , because their prices were great - but now at_least i know what to expect .
neutral	the website , though , did not work properly .
negative	recd : 0 / 0 / 00
negative	we are carers so this was very frustrating .
negative	i finally sent them the credit_card charge that said netcertlabs on our credit_card statement next to the charge .
positive	happy day !
negative	unfortunately , i understand that rates done directly through the source , this case being howard_johnson and not booking . com , can differ from doing it through a third - party source - when i am being charged for a 0 night_stay at $_000 . 00 including taxes through howard_johnson for 0 days this does not make_sense .
negative	moral of this story is find a place closer to home to buy your bees .
positive	we would highly_recommend powermax to our family and friends .
negative	i did receive a credit for the damaged goods , but from now on , i '_ll take my money elsewhere .
positive	and stays on my head very well i am in love with this wig !
positive	i can also say that in my medical field i can purchase supplements from companies that will only sell to doctors .
neutral	i usually like buying from b_&_h but this was a sour experience .
negative	just tried to contact expedia to have them help me with a modification to my trip .
negative	i ordered one item to try them out .
positive	i can '_t_believe it got here in something like a day and a half .
negative	i was very disappointed to have my order canceled when a item marked " in stock " was actually not in stock .
positive	purchased through a groupon , i didn_'_t know what to expect .
neutral	i love getting cat_food cans delived to my door and i love the low price but my last two shipments contained damaged_cans .
neutral	all clothing and accessories were delivered promptly and in perfect_condition .
positive	peach has the best guitar porn on the net , best pics best gear
negative	parts wrong they never respond tu return p shhhhh
positive	i know i will get new products .
positive	the website is easy to use .
neutral	i was a bit upset that the site didn_'_t notify me of the shipping delay so that i could have made alternative plans to find the food elsewhere .
positive	it '_s what you are often promised but rarely delivered .
neutral	they are as_described , but frankly if you were a student in a room , one would take up the majority of the room .
neutral	i wouldn_'_t have tried this service had it not been for the groupon offer .
negative	questioned the parking fee and again on hold and finally his comment to that was that the hotel charges for that - did they not charge for that on monday !!!
neutral	he walks around the front of the van , gets in and starts pulling away .
positive	the product arrived the day after i paid , well_packed and in excellent condition .
neutral	when i rented the car and took it they advertised the lower price gas , but did not mention that they would be charging a whole tank regardless of the amount left in it .
positive	b_&_h showed they are more than just a store there to sell products and put money in their pocket .
negative	i was charged $_00 . 00 dollars after changing the names since they claimed they had to cancel the flight and rebooked it with the " correct names ".
neutral	0rd time lucky .
neutral	my last recurring order , however , shipped from nv without_any specific notice to me other than the usual provided tracking_info .
negative	wouldnt mind but i have payed over_£ 00o for it .
neutral	i '_ll continue to use them for buybacks as their prices are typically better_than average , but i '_m not sure i '_ll purchase books from them in the future .
negative	now i am getting 0 of this same item !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
positive	they are the only place i was able to find small enough bottles that actually seal making it great or different olive oils and limoncello !
neutral	true , they don_'_t .
positive	check their site out for your critters .
negative	oh and they actually fit to size .
neutral	when we initially made the reservation , the prices went up during the process .
neutral	just not very intuitive .
negative	i observed that the email offer does not mention you can only use one code and the online booking does not make this clear either .
neutral	a few hours_later another e_-_mail arrived , a duplicate of the first .
neutral	so the next afternoon i called travelocity and talked ( or tried to talk ) to a call_center with the person on the other who had an accent so thick it made communicating nearly_impossible .
negative	they reserved the la_quinta room in the wrong town , 000_miles_away - when i drove 00 miles to get my room , i found out their error , plus the hotel ( and the rest of the town ) were sold out .
neutral	i wrote the above but what u gotta do is be a little patient coz all communication is via_email no phone_calls .
positive	arrived two_days_later with a free pen
neutral	i wss told it would take 0 - 0 . 0 hours to put on 0 new_tires .
positive	i ordered my double sided garden clock on the internet last saturday_evening and was surprised and delighted that it arrived only three_days_later .
positive	brilliant service for £ 0 '_s worth of guitar pick .
positive	delivery was super speedy too !
neutral	to return the damaged case , i know have to take a day off work to wait in all day for a courier to take the case back .
negative	feeling very uncomfortable with this response , i did more research to find the local number for the hotel .
negative	each time i get the standard reply saying i will be contacted within a day or two .
positive	i was kept completely informed of delivery dates and times and there were no_problems .
neutral	per the usps . com site first_class postage is listed as 0 - 0 days for most places .
neutral	airbnb values transparency and truthful reviews that is great .
neutral	if you are short delivered they do not come_back to deliver the shortfall you are stuck with whatever has_been left .
negative	since my review on 00 . 00 . 00 , daniel kudrick requested me to email him & provide him the order details .
positive	lynhurtig levering det spil jeg_havde_bestilt .
positive	i love love love them .
negative	there are fedex labels on the packages with our correct address , but the driver must not double_check if they look at all .
neutral	this order should have been here by mon .
neutral	that is , each cardboard_box had 0 00 # boxes of litter .
positive	i saw a guy on tv at the sex pistols live concert wearing a harrington_jacket and thought " i got to get one ! "
positive	i have purchased from partsgeek . com before and i will again .
negative	this representative was very demeaning by saying “ you are viewing the information that everyone else sees ”.
neutral	better go and buy at the store if you have the chance .
negative	the rest of the bubble_wrap was at the top of the box .
positive	i always have great service here
neutral	so all in all , a bizzare experience , but so long as i get my stuff , i can live with that .
neutral	my expectation was that 00 to 00 thousand_miles from then i would go back to replace those tires .
negative	!
neutral	again , i have had to ask my co_workers to go out of their way to take me home from work .
neutral	meiner meinung nach sollte dies einfacher geregelt werden können , zb mit benutzung der mailadresse .
negative	i would never shop_here again .
neutral	i sent in a inquiry as to why the buttons were sticking and i received a response almost_immediately .
negative	one of the reservations i made said that it could be cancelled within 00_hours on the description .
negative	being that his connection there is not the best he figured it did not go through so he went to a different site & successfully purchased the exact_same ticket with the same airline for the same dates & times .
positive	( norway customs took_longer ) packaged with appropriate adapter and bundled with fantastic raw_food book .
neutral	they are a bait and switch company , citing one price at point of sale , then tacking on multitudes of hidden_fees that drive up the fare at point of service .
negative	the ebay part had a different part number and fit perfect .
neutral	other than that great price and great service .
negative	they confirmed the wrong room rate and then sent me 00 emails canceling .
neutral	the picture on the website is bad and it doesn_'_t say anything about it not having the logo .
negative	i brought this to the company '_s attention and expressed extreme dissatisfaction .
negative	i should not have had to pay for the return .
neutral	until they wanted too much info !!!
positive	thank_you .
positive	my computer is running much faster , even the internet seems quicker .
negative	please refer to what your competitors use like chegg , bookrenter , collegebookrenter . etc .
positive	the price was cheap .
positive	arrived quickly - branded medication not a knock_off
neutral	they won_'_t give me the credit_reports that i need / signed_up for .
negative	i told_him i needed a reservation for saturday , may 00 and that we would need a roll away bed for my daughter .
positive	they have never disappointed me .
neutral	i have found everything that i '_m looking for , i just hope i get it .
positive	our rv is located in a very small town and not easy to find .
neutral	i still don_'_t know why bathempire couldn_'_t take the money , but i basically had to ask a friend to help out and pay for me , then pay them back later .
negative	i did this at 0 am .
positive	my curtain fabric arrived so quickly i couldn_'_t_believe it , and to be delivered on a big cardboard roll with no folds is amazing .
positive	i needed some replacement parts which a couple of big name retail pool stores told me the part was so old that no one makes it any more .
neutral	the continental_breakfast was well stocked .
positive	the order came in the exact time they promised .
negative	never never never agin !
positive	we would not_hesitate to recommend their services and we will_definitely be contacting them when we plan our next holiday .
negative	i have to go locally to buy her more
positive	placed my order and got free p_& p as order was over_£_00 .
negative	the air suspension compressor stopped_working . needed this part after checking prices and reading_reviews ordered part and wanted it shipped to my son '_s home in pittsburgh .
neutral	but it takes way to long to get here
positive	purchased this solenoid from showerdoc .
neutral	it '_s still not as great as it sounds tho ', the option is available to only a very limited amount of items and is yet to be available for the majority of the items on the site ( and we don_'_t even know how many items will have the feature in the future , but here '_s hoping it will be available for the majority of the website '_s items ), more_importantly we have yet to see it in action as it has only been implemented for a few_days now .
positive	highly_recommended for the art aficionado .
positive	i wish more companies dealt so well with problems and in such a good manner .
negative	we had no success but he encouraged me to keep trying and change the dates or pick a different airline to use .
positive	!
positive	i '_ll continue to use partsgeek . com on any future_purchases .
neutral	no discount .
negative	what else was i supposed to do but make the payment ?
neutral	thank_you
positive	i would definitely recommend .
positive	after_speaking with the other agency we figure that we got awesome deal !
neutral	on voit que_la_commande de bouge pas , au_bout de plusieurs jours , on appelle , et_la on nous dit que l ' objet est hors stock et qu ' il_faut x semaines pour_l ' avoir . la le sav nous propose un avoir sur l ' objet .
positive	plus , i feel_like i '_ve disposed of the mobiles responsibly .
negative	warning learn from our mistake and don_'_t take a tour !
positive	a very very good shopping_experience , now to tone up !
neutral	now my item is being shipped_separately but i have no_idea when , and that was the item i was most eager to get .
negative	i asked for a return number as well and didn_'_t get one yet either and its been 0 days now .
negative	the next_day i had to sign_up for call back service .
positive	i would like to pass on my sincerest thanks for what can only be described as an extremely pleasurable and pain_free experience dealing_with your company .
neutral	they call the same person that i just spoke to , and what happens they find that i do indeed have a reservation along with the keys and directions to our condo are in a lock box on the side of the building .
negative	i ordered a tonneau cover for my truck put the yr make and model and it gave_me the one i searched and ordered it thinking that it would fit my truck .
neutral	the local royal_mail sorting_office would be half empty if it wasn_'_t for amazon '_s business .
negative	this is bait & switch or out - and - out fraud .
positive	very helpful nothing is to much , when i phone for my second or third order i told the c / a i ' d see what i wanted on youtube .
neutral	later i found spicers . great , only to find my order was out on delivery , which i did not pay for . luckily when they contacted the driver he was actually at my home . i gave him instructions as to where he should leave the order .
negative	our hotel clerk confirmed this and was unable to assist in changing the reservation .
negative	no automated email updated on delivery .
neutral	the part was a perfect match when compared to the original .
negative	0kg er åbenbart for stor en opgave at sende fra sjælland til jylland for wupti .
neutral	hostelworld . com provides travellers with a multitude of peer - reviewed accommodation options at the click of a mouse .
negative	they told me complimentary_breakfast and a smoking_room .
neutral	they need to do something about improving their chek - in procedures .
negative	please read below .
neutral	not sure why all of this was necessary since they used the same credit_card information .
neutral	i '_ve had at_least 0 situations in last month where a restaurant they say will deliver or has a particular food doesn_'_t do one or either of those things at the time i ordered .
negative	my wife and i flew from sevilla to copenhagen ( via barcelona ) on the 00 . 00 . 0000 .
neutral	i have so_far received two shipments from pet_flow .
positive	its liquid and at first it looks bad , but once it dries it has such a nice look !
negative	no one will return my emails .
neutral	can you explain the credit_card misses ?
neutral	i think i will investigate somewhere_else to purchase my supplements .
positive	i enjoy the compliments that i get from people when i am wearing something different that is not found in the local high_street , as being from a small town , it can be hard not to turn up at an event without someone_else wearing the exact_same thing .
neutral	the information between the company and myself is slow going .
negative	i bought a front_bumper for my son '_s birthday , and i waited for atleast 0_weeks , and it never came in .

negative	the design is ok ( template based with limited personalisation ) and delivery of the show / website was fairly prompt .
neutral	thanks
positive	my beautiful gown was in stock .
positive	in a sentence , good hotel in a great location at a great price , and took seconds to book , it should always be like this !
neutral	and the heifer dust excuses from the operator about quality control and delivery slots !
neutral	in any case i would still order from you again and it is certainly possible i read more into the ad than was implied .
negative	i left 0 very stressed messages on thier voicemail asking for a return call but no one called me back .
negative	needless to say , this one - time event was very important and they really screwed_up .
positive	great service .
neutral	however , our flight home was delayed by four hours and were told on arrival that we had to pay £_00 cash for arriving late .
positive	!
neutral	really pleased with the table but the next_day delivery was really misleading .
positive	i recommend it to anyone i can .
neutral	i ordered just the pouches .
negative	i recently_purchased a radiator from partsgeek and after receiving it i installed it within a right a way upon getting it .
positive	shine bright and low_cost .
positive	dave is so incredibly_helpful and knowledgable on tires / rims .
negative	was not able to speak to a supervisor but finally had a person on the phone that was a tad_bit more helpful .
neutral	shouldn_'_t there be some kind of re - check before the box is sealed and delivered ?
positive	thank_you ,
negative	as a example i ordered some e_- ciggerets and they arrived the next_day .
positive	love pureformulas they always have what i need .

positive	!
negative	this is the second drive axle i had to order from parts_geek .
neutral	i received my order and i was happy about the expereince . especially the price .
positive	you never know what '_s around the corner when you order something on line until it arrives days_later .
negative	not sure what the trouble was , they seemed not to get perforated by the machine .
positive	i can read the labels , i can get him treats and toys .
positive	my husband rang me from work on monday , said order me a boss js - 0 .
positive	you order , you pay and it arrives within 00_hours .
negative	order #_00000000
neutral	however the garage that i selected was not as pleasant .
neutral	given the new ipad_cover is actualy better lookin then what i wanted but the point is that what i ordered is not what was sent .
positive	only_drawback is you have to know what you want because the descriptions aren_'_t as lengthy as other_sites , but it '_s not a problem if you do some research .
negative	marilyn . harding .
neutral	i love them .
neutral	tried_calling , but no one ever answered .

neutral	if it were not for the quality product i would not purchase .
positive	lowest_prices and fast delivery .
positive	i also love that i can redeem points that get me money off by reviewing products and referring to friends .
negative	on the plus side , it looks like the phone i received is indeed new and with all accessories ( battery , charger , headphones , etc_.)
negative	their product descriptions have nothing to do with reality . i bought two_pairs of " suede " boots that turned_out to be velveteen !
positive	a co - worker of mine steered_me toward brilliance , and i immediately found what i had been looking for .
negative	the customer service rep . from promgirl couldn_'_t hook me up with a swatch or added material to take to a seamstress for alteration .
neutral	unfortunately , the product was not what we had hoped for .
neutral	i can '_t find coupon_codes anywhere ?!
negative	i personally never had to call the customer_service department so i wasn_'_t aware of how bad it truly is .
negative	i had a very hard time understanding the woman .
neutral	houd het simpel voor_mij , ik vroeg om 0 : 0 afdruk en regeen jullie dan de rest , vertel mij alleen wat het kost .
negative	however when she tried to cancel my reservations your company tried to charge my credit_card .
positive	out of all of the companies that winona computers has tried to get laptop_screens from to repair our customers broken laptop_screens , screen_country has_become the company of choice for the last 0 years .
neutral	delivery . com is only as good as the restaurants it serves .

neutral	i clarified that two beds were needed and provided them with my booking number .

neutral	i like boohoo items and think they are of a good quality however i think this is let_down by the fact that their is no free delivery option like on other_websites such as asos .

neutral	they claimed the contract through auto_europe was for 0pm to 0pm and we were turning in the car at 00am !

positive	an excellent company to work with .

negative	check your parts list before you start !,,
neutral	i would have never ordered the cable if i had known .
negative	tag dog et ansvar .
negative	i also think the rate quoted on the phone should be the same as that on the website .
positive	top quality products , with reasonable prices .
negative	i received your email_asking me to review hotel , which i took time to do .
neutral	and the hotel didn_'_t email me my hotel packet !
positive	you really feel the want to help .
negative	i ordered 000_dollars worth of parts .
negative	i had to ask if i could get a 00 or if it was a 00 .
positive	moving between different pages was pretty seamless , the product information was compact and easy to understand and it was easy to be able to compare the offers available and thus choose the offer best suited to my needs .
positive	i ordered a bunch of bags thinking in case the price went up i would have some for a while .
negative	i would be on hold for 00 + min before i would even get on the line with someone , then put on hold to be transferred to a supervisor where i would be on hold for another 00 - 00_minutes only for my call to get disconnected during the transferring of the call .
positive	if you don_'_t take_advantage of this site you ' re crazy !
positive	overall i was very impressed by the service that they gave_me & would recommend them to anyone - 0 * service
positive	great price .
negative	you gave_me intimate knowledge on when fedex delivers , by screwing up the first repair and having me return my laptop , and then screwing up the second repair by having me return my laptop again .
positive	everything would have been just perfect if only autoeurope or dollar or hertz could have communicated that hertz wa she kiosk we were looking for .
positive	i know where i will be buying my next appliance from .
positive	mike was great help , bought 0 new_tires .
neutral	i called and spoke to a representative who could not actually fix this problem but did call hotel and car places and said they do show my reservations .
positive	the cosmetic quality was first rate , it looked like new although it had a ` c ` rating .
positive	my new wellies are lovely too .
positive	it has_been a big_hit !
negative	i was so excited when i found letsunlockiphone0 .
neutral	that being said my mother has always been happy with the service .
neutral	so .
negative	it '_s possible , however the staff doesn_'_t seem to take much pride in the company anyway so that may be far - fetched .
negative	they suck
negative	the other gift_card was upgraded to 0 day business delivery and made it to its_destination .
neutral	i love b_&_h , but on this purchase they had zero knowledge of the item which was several_hundred_dollars .
neutral	please call me as soon as possible to let_me know when i can be expecting my refund for the merchandise i had to send back .
neutral	so much so that i '_m going to order another one .
negative	now i remember why i never use travelocity .
positive	definitely a company to recommend .
neutral	however , be prepared to negotiate a pretty clumsy web_site .
positive	i would definately_use them again .
neutral	i needed to change an item and could not get hold of anyone by phone .
positive	you really cannot replicate that kind of experience anywhere_else , and with no fees ?
negative	my wait time between calls was at_least 00_minutes each time .
neutral	mike
positive	i '_m not so sure about the quality since it '_s my first order and i haven_'_t gotten them in my hands yet .
positive	this website was quick and easy to use would recommend it to anyone
negative	i felt badly for her because another customer was also having issues with the parking situation while another one was trying to work out an_additional guest .
neutral	this wasn_'_t directly the fault of showerdoc , but ultimately it was their responsibility to get the item there on time .
neutral	they don_'_t fit in the case that was sent with the glasses .
neutral	but waiting for more than a week to get them ( form illinois to michigan ), and missing a weekend window of opportunity to make the repairs , was frustrating .
neutral	recipient was very pleased with the arrangement however , i was unhappy with the delivery .
neutral	i never had any_problems until i purchased a voucher recently which had a very short validity .
positive	i ' d advise anyone_who shops for supplements to check out these_guys .
negative	i could not believe it !
neutral	not enough talking - wanted to hear more about the sites .
negative	dhgate will use tactics to prolong the situation instead of doing the right thing by refunding they will give you runarounds and they actually told me i had to wait 00 - 00 days .
negative	tracking told me it went to the wrong_address , was rejected and sent back to you .
negative	i have rented_cars in europe many_times ( over 00 different times ) - never experienced anything like i have with guerin .
positive	excellant service very smooth_transaction
negative	ami_clubwear may have cute_clothes for dirt_cheap , but you get what you pay for and they obviously do not invest in their customer_service or quality .
negative	finally , after reaching a representative and explaining the situation , he checked and informed me that the original salesperson who took my order was no_longer with the company .
neutral	my resulting transcription had commas and periods in the right places , but also the words " comma ", " period ", " new paragraph ", " quote ", " parentheses " and so forth .
negative	overall a very tiresome and not pleasant_experience .
negative	i made an order on wednesday 00th of april from this company since they stated that the delivery time would be 0 - 0 days .
neutral	the service i received was no more nor less_than i wopuld expect any company to give me
negative	she was very upset by this point , and said she wanted a copy of the transcripts , when they “ reviewed ” her transcript they stated that nothing was ever said of that matter and called her a lier , she than demanded a copy of it knowing that this was not true .
negative	basically this company have just taken our money without receiving any goods .
neutral	other parking lots buses were there three_times before your bus did arrives and pick me up .
negative	your service is pathetic
neutral	they are resending the remaining order .
negative	they were very professional and respectful .
positive	great ordering experience
neutral	the clear section is way too small .
negative	i do not believe your hotel is going to make up for this treatment .
positive	i truly recommend parts_geek over any super store or main_stream vendors .
neutral	bookbyte was definitely the cheapest .
positive	the product arrived in perfect_condition , and securely_packed .
negative	it worked out okay until they could not trace my funds wired from paypal into my account .
positive	never had any_problems .
negative	i usually use kayak but travelocity had a special so i booked through them instead .
positive	very happy with the products and service .
positive	after going to several nutrition supplement stores physically and online i found the product stocked only at supplement_warehouse .
neutral	i ordered two parts a fuel_filter and a fuel_pump , they were both under the same tracking_number .
neutral	before i ordered i called and asked what the shelf_life of the product was so that if i get two bags right_away , there ' d be plenty of time to use it .
positive	nothing else is needed to be said .
negative	nowhere on the website is there a link to shipping information so one does not know if the item shipped or not .
negative	jeg sad til forhør i 0 timer , for herefter at få beskeden " da du / i ikke_har 00000 ,-_kr .
positive	the help i received was exceptionally good so i thank_you for that !
neutral	we were also told there was a 0 / 0 hour " grace period " for returning the van exactly 0 days_later .
neutral	you are still showing accounts that have been removed by the credit_bureaus .
neutral	i also called their shipping department and left a voice_mail to confirm they saw it .
positive	particularly effective as a post trainer .
positive	i ordered from north_shore , received it much sooner_than i hoped .
neutral	i ' d just be more cautious is all .
neutral	but over all good review .
negative	you were asked to review your reservation , including the terms associated with cancellations or changes .
neutral	unfortunately over time this has ceased to be the case and quite_often shopto is actually more costly than amazon to order from ( game are still of course pricing their products too high which goes without saying really ).
positive	it also allow your web or blog to be accessable even after you posted it online .
negative	company has not followed through in regards to shipping info .
negative	the company said the first order went out ok in january but for some unknown_reason , it was shipped back to the company without ever contacting me .
neutral	based on current usage i should be ok , but . anyway i was disappointed .
positive	excellent working with this company .
negative	we will call the hotel direct or simply walk - in next time .
positive	!
neutral	i booked a class of vehicle that i was somewhat familiar with as i drive a matrix at home , a toyota auris , it was the car shown in the advertising material , when we arrived we asked about a gps unit , one was immediately produced and given to us at a charge of 000 bp for the hire period , first it only spoke german , so a trip back to the point of sale was required , pouring_rain and freezing_cold didn_'_t help .
positive	i '_m a new customer , but , so_far i '_m extremely pleased .
neutral	all in all , i would go back with a ride home next time !
negative	i bought shoes and i send a complaint about this product .
positive	uk e_- liquid make everything easy , fast and simple , with some of the best liquids and hardware around . ive been vaping for a long time , tried everything , uk liqs stuff works , dont need nothin else . try the kentucky no . 0 from vermillion , flavour country ;)
neutral	hrs is very comparable to other hotel booking platforms in terms of information delivered .
positive	this was my first order with printer_basics , i previously ordered from a company i believed was the best for price and delivery service , but printer_basics beat them on price and certainly delivered my order very quickly .
neutral	reasons - a small dog toy would not be appropriate for a large dog , and while small dogs may be able to play with large dog toys , there would be the option for them to choose the small dog spoiled pet box , to get appropriate sized items . if you sent a small toy to a large dog , there would be a chance for them to swallow it , causing issues .
negative	checked delivery status on line package was left by back door .
positive	really quick delivery with tx messages as to when it would be delivered !
neutral	i did make an inquiry about the activities covered_under certain levels of cover in the backpacker policies as a certain activity was not listed on the website .
positive	the sunglasses are great it only took one working day until they were at front_door thank_you and i will be using this again and telling all my friends about it .
neutral	however the delivery of some of them was questionable and the ability to check the progress of the delivery is not actually possible !
negative	then i called your customer_service representative again to tell her that the package was delivered , but the conversation was basically unproductive .
neutral	i used my visa_debit_card online to pay for the flight ( completely forgetting that i have a limit as to how much i can take out of my account each day ) and did not notice until hours_later that my transaction had in fact not gone_through .
neutral	so i guess i '_ll be calling to ask what happened .
neutral	i have rented through bookbyte several_times and have always been impressed with the prices and ease - of - return .
neutral	i have recommended inkfarm to several of my friends .
negative	i tried to order a red chrome xbox_controller due to all websites being out of stock , so this popped_up on google shopping ( usually a good reliable_source ) ordered , the item went from in stock to out of stock .
positive	thank_you so much for bringing our vision to life , we love the new flash_drives to give to our clients !
neutral	i also feel that their prices for some items are to high and not being_able to buy items that are available in other_countries seems petty ?
neutral	it seems like its not as well_organised as it once was and they are happy to take your money even when they haven_'_t got enough staff to accommodate the travel times or volume of customers - if i had been informed of this when i booked , i would have checked out another company .
negative	i almost did not purchase with the site just because of the service experience .
positive	the selection was great and pricing was fair , some less_than desirable weather slowed the shipping down but it still arrived within the estimated time .
neutral	i also e_- mailed wizard with a query it was at_least 0_weeks before i got a reply .
positive	it looks great , very organized .
negative	i '_ll never use their services !
neutral	i was amazed_at the prices and selection from festive_lights and ordered 00 baubles from them .
neutral	the prices are good when they have a sale , but shipping is hit - or - miss .
positive	worth_every_penny !
negative	the pool company can print whatever they want and say i misunderstood but that is not correct .
positive	the books were also perfectly described , and arrived before the time they were estimated to !
positive	the order came within a few_days .
positive	she was amazing !
positive	found exactly_what i was lookibg for on their website .
neutral	i called a travel advisor , whose english was halting , to see if he could avoid the extra overnight that was part of my two round trips ( cleveland - madrid ; madrid - istanbul ).
neutral	i wanted vanilla , not banana flavour but absolutely no chance of amending the order .
neutral	i really like their setup and would use them as my default browser , but everything prints in small_print and i can '_t figure_out how to easily change the print size . all other browsers print fine ?
negative	no concern at all shown by staff , who were diinterested in the extreme .
neutral	the pump ( with electronics ) was in the original flimsy cardboard_box and then put in a plastic_bag for despatch .
positive	a lot of the time it '_s shopto and when it is i '_m always chuffed because i know it will arrive the next working day and i '_ll get some reward_points :)
negative	even_though i received two emails in reply saying they were on the case and i ' d hear from them in 00_hours ( turned_out to be several days ) a representative emailed me saying they hadn_'_t gotten an_email from me regarding the problem .
neutral	i really appreciated it when you could search for a trip including dates around the ones you entered .
positive	the fabric is heavy and beautifully textured .
positive	this is great because i always double_check my hotels with the reviews on trip_advisor , so having it right there with the booking engine is so useful .
negative	as background , i was looking for a pair of very limited_edition frames that i could not find in stores or online .
negative	sorry you do not respect your customer .
positive	it was quick and easy
negative	word spreads and they are shooting themselves in the forehead with terrible service .
positive	after this experience , i '_ll definitely be back !
negative	email_confirmation did not state it was via expedia but showed a picture of the hilton with whom i was booked .
positive	the part was easy to look - up and they had it in stock when no one else did .
neutral	the shipping is still global_eyeglasses responsibility .
neutral	we were on our last can when it finally arrived .
positive	this was a trip of a lifetime and from start to end it was well scheduled .
negative	great concept poor performance .
neutral	i was very disappointed by the website '_s misleading information , and now i have to find a place to rent a van or truck cheaply .
neutral	needless to say , i lost money for the core_charge .
negative	she hung the phone up .
positive	super impressed with how quickly the order arrived and happy with the price too .
neutral	so stuck with an hugely expensive pc that falls to bits easily and overheats all the time no_matter what we put on it or do to cool it .
neutral	when the jets go bad ( break ) it " s nice to be able to replace it in a more like weeks not months .
neutral	living less_than 00_minutes from their warehouse and having to pay $_00 + for shipping seems extreme , okay it is extreme .
positive	i '_ll be back for more .
positive	quickest getaway from heathrow possible
negative	0 days_later i saw that my bank_account had been charged for the order so i excitedly looked to see if there was a tracking_number . no luck .
negative	obviously you get what you pay for and i will not make the same mistake again .
neutral	as a lot of the business will be by internet sales i would suggest using more local delivery people or allow additional information within the postal address as a few lines is sometimes not sufficient .
neutral	upon my request , internetgiftstore promptly refunded my delivery charge and the products arrived quickly and as_described .
positive	won_'_t bother with bodybuilding . com any more as they never have items in stock and delivery takes weeks .
positive	i have purchased and sold artwork on fine_art america .
positive	delivery is pretty quick and the products are good quality and at sensible prices .
negative	i wish i would have read more reviews prior to booking .
positive	their sizes are larger than others for less money .
negative	too many robot responses and transfers take up to a month
neutral	at that point it was too late to return it and i knew that there would be no option of a refund or replacement once this was built up .
negative	so , i bought a ubisoft - game heroes vi .
neutral	if that email had not mentioned the matching_wallpaper or mentioned it but stated that laptops were not included then this whole issue would never occurred .
positive	my experiences have always been good ; hassle_free , and good from my location to theirs . no_problems .
negative	part was shipped late and received late .
negative	i am very unhappy with the lack of customer_service and communication , i still have no phone , and i have no_idea when to expect it ( although they certainly had no problem with charging my card right_away ).
neutral	i think maybe you could use a different courier company or on your website you could have the option of instructions if one is not at home as most internet shopping websites do .
positive	i was quite surprised and delighted to get my order in record_time . approximately 0 days .
positive	i '_ll certainly use them again .
positive	i would recommend many_thanks mrs forsyth
negative	the courier attempted to deliver them on monday 00st march , i refused delivery .
neutral	while i might look around for another site to purchase the same products , i am sure that this is not normal procedure for pure_health .
neutral	returning a part is a pain .
negative	rgds r . ryffel
negative	the next_day i received an_email_stating my order was on hold because they wouldn_'_t ship it to another address .
positive	i checked the price of my tickets on the airline '_s own website , and the price on travelocity was lower .
positive	great web_site and no_problems at all .
neutral	for each button i ' d sent the original photo together with a " cut - out " showing what area of the photo to use on the button .
positive	i bought a set of fog_lights for my 0000_saab 0 - 0 aero to replace the old pitted ones and the prices were between $_000 -$_000 a light everywhere_else , i paid $_000 each with parts_geek .
positive	i have no_hesitation in recommending this company and the car_seat .
neutral	i had to call and figure_out that it had been canceled .
positive	they were not in a rush and took their time to put on the new rubber too .
neutral	the pictures of the parts you are ordering was great and helpful .
negative	no , of course not , because they '_ve got their money .
neutral	not bad , not good .
neutral	if you have a return you halfto jump threw a hoop to return insted of just returning !!!!
neutral	any company that uses such poor couriers should rethink who they use as it has put me off using joulsb again .
neutral	as a criticism though , i had to pay for the whole unit to be returned .
positive	i '_ve actually done business with them before several_years_ago , and would again .
positive	with out doubt the best service i have been offered
neutral	was offered the possibility of a return if i shipped the items back on my dime .
positive	i am looking_forward to using street shirts again in the future .
neutral	r . hoover
positive	found website easy to use and my order arrived_promptly .
positive	what more could you ask for .
positive	!
positive	placed the order , got charged , got code , as easy and as fast as you read that .

positive	the gave_me exactly_what i needed at a great price and provided accurate and fast shipping .
negative	no , so we had to call and wait 00_minutes to talk to someone again .
positive	excellent prices and availability of products from different companies , so only 0 shipping cost !
positive	000_% satisfied customer .
neutral	the reviews however are not anonymous from the hostel being rated .
negative	i interpret this to mean : 0 ) the prices quoted on travelocity '_s site cannot be trusted and 0 ) if a merchant does not provide a service or good for the price that was provided to travelocity , travelocity will not do anything about it .
neutral	the person on the phone was most apologetic however and the order came in the next 0 days .
negative	worst_experience ever .
negative	trust_pilot apparently makes no attempt to check that reviews are genuine or warranted , and does not provide email_addresses for businesses to follow_up with people who have posted their complaints .
neutral	every time after being on hold for 00_minutes , the automated answering system told me they were experiencing a high_volume of calls and to call back .
positive	once ordered , i was given regular_updates as to the status of the order .

neutral	the tracking_information provided was only for the shipment containing the toys .

neutral	as luck would have it , i only live around 00miles away from bathempire , so i offered to help save everyone '_s time , money and effort by simply returning the " wrong " component to them in person one evening ( their sales office is open until 0pm or something ).
positive	making the customer feel at home , with non_- inflated charges .
negative	and , after having gone_through all this trouble and getting nothing at the end , a simple " i '_m sorry " is not acceptable .
neutral	i am usually not one to write_reviews on things , but i thought i would add some insight to any of the guys out there searching for an_engagement_ring .
neutral	no refund or discount .

negative	nov - 00 - 0000
neutral	the site in itself is questionable because of the layout and major discount prices .

neutral	when paying it would not accept 0 valid cards .
negative	they say " the lenses are already made and cant be refunded ".
positive	they called first to confirm the order , then they send emails_letting_me know that the piece had been delivered .
negative	after 00_minutes i hung_up .
neutral	on trying to book again after being prompted by an_email from " skypark_steve " problems with the booking_procedure became_apparent .

negative	on top of this suprise , i had asked sasha via_email on may 00 , 0000 for any kind of paperwork or details regarding our policy because all i had received was a 0 page insurance binder with a very small_amount of information .
negative	after difficulty in reaching the company by phone ( their preference is by internet ), i spoke to an agent who assured me that the cancellation_policy was generous and flexible ; i remember his telling_me to call two_days prior to my pick - up date and the contract could be cancelled at no charge to me .
neutral	ups is to slow and not very dependable on delivery plain lazy .
neutral	the people on the phone are sometime ok but often rude , abrupt , and unhelpful .

negative	i then had another none reply e . mail saying my credit_card had expired since ordering the tickets , could i phone them . more expense !!!!

neutral	my line was very choppy .
positive	great service , easy to use site .
negative	i was very unhappy because i asked the gentleman_who was taking my call if i was talking direct with the hotel change i was booking with .

positive	the shipping is fast and only takes a day or two .
positive	b_&_h is consistently the best in terms of service , price , and reliability .

positive	can '_t ask for more .
neutral	customer_service only last until you buy the car and leave .
neutral	not good .
neutral	i enjoy working with n0wireless but when it comes to the product itself .
negative	of course they don_'_t have a customer_service phone line to call , so i had to file a complaint with the company online and now have to wait to hear from them .
neutral	comment on the web_site ~ it doesn_'_t tell you the currency you purchase in until after you have committed to buy , and it doesn_'_t tell you how long this is mine to use ~ is it a yearly subscription , is it mine to keep ?
neutral	!
positive	it was prompt and in good condition , and better_than bargained for !!!!
positive	the parts got here on time and as expected .

positive	please consider cash for books .
neutral	that '_s about all i can say .
negative	i now use these_types of services to search for hotels in an area and then book direct with the hotel . either by phone ( the horror - actually talking to somebody ) or online .

positive	i looked at argos , tesco_direct etc websites for a new washing_machine but found that the prices for machines in the £_000 -£_000 range to be £_00 -£_00 cheaper at appliances_online .
negative	well that should have been my first warning signal that in order to churn out dresses that cheaply , the rest of their business must be shocking and it is .

neutral	i understand that once the box leaves bb , they have no control of it '_s handling , but wouldn_'_t it be best to package the plant in such a way that there is less chance of damage and / or mark the box to ensure " this end up " or something like that ?
positive	this company makes it unnecessary for a credit_card extra guarantee or any other separate insurance_coverage .
positive	i liked to free shipping !

neutral	we were almost expecting damaged goods and having to take photographs .
negative	i had been looking for an online store to buy my lifeguard suit from for a while .

negative	i paid almost $_000 for these parts and can '_t get in touch with anyone .
neutral	i am really worried_about it .
negative	the minor discount in the room rate is not worth it !
negative	dont use argus !
negative	i then had to contact the credit_card company and the hotel to make_sure the reservation was in order .

positive	dan was wonderful , helpful and honest !
positive	item was delivered in quick time and as_advertised .
neutral	but when i called back later to clarify why they did not mentioned free front_wheel_alignment and did not explained the difference_between front and full alignments they refunded me for the $_00 .
positive	also the prices on the website don_'_t include_vat until after its in the basket which i know they are not the only store to do this but i prefer to know what i '_m paying when i put it in the basket not just at the checkout stage

negative	on their website they show you the size of their trees they send vs their competition .
negative	i asked bravofly to put us on an earlier flight with precision air - they told me there were no earlier flights - a simple web search proved otherwise .
neutral	sorry to post negative_comments but i have to be honest or whats the point ?
negative	wtf !
negative	i ordered a radiator and you guys didn_'_t give me a choice to ship 0nd day .
neutral	i saw all the other buses more frequently .
negative	after i placed my order ( which had to be over £_00 for the system to allow it ), they then messaged me back some days_later to inform_me that the minimum charge for my order has_been put up to £_00 instead .
negative	the second time , i ordered online , the money was confirmed from my account then the next_day i receive an_email that the billing_address didn_'_t match the credit_card address .
negative	please be careful people .
positive	it also shipped to my house very quickly .
positive	this is a great website to order from . everything went_smoothly from the ordering process to the receiving process .
negative	the walls were so paper thin we could hear the tv from room next to us .
negative	after seconds of placing my order realized that i place two order the same and i wanted to change one of the order so i call customer service and customer service said that i had to fill_out a support_ticket and after i filling it out it took about three day for them to e_-_mail back .
positive	i look_forward to ordering more parts soon !
positive	the sideboard is well made and apart_from a small problem with one of the drawer knobs ( easily rectified ) it looks lovely .
positive	not heard of this company before so trusted the other good reviews and was not dissappointed .
positive	very good price , considerably_cheaper_than tesco asda etc .
neutral	if you ' re going to rent them , at_least keep them current !
negative	tested over a week , they did this 0 times - advertising the car at a cheap price and 0 times with different customers they said it was the wrong price " a clich on the internet " buyer_beware - never buy from these cheats
negative	this is a further addition to my review dated 00 / 00 / 0000 .
positive	the delivery , installation and removal of the old_machine went like_clockwork - the delivery team were charming too !
neutral	generally i '_m very happy with the service provided .

neutral	the company contacted me at_least 0 times to make_sure i was not canceling the initial appointment .
neutral	if you '_ve ever watched parislovely , you know what a whiny little money hungry bitch is .
neutral	no disclosure was made at the time of purchase regarding their core refund policy .
neutral	their competitors claim you receive same day payment , however i have never sold a phone with them , so there is work to be done !
negative	i was asked to provide an_alternative address for shipping because it was different from my billing_address i called my credit_card and did so .
positive	ordered on line , received almost_immediate_response by email that purchase was being_processed .
negative	we wanted the flowers del on friday but was told the funeral was to earley at_0am so you del thursday we should have been told this before we orded them as it was not until wedsday we was told it was to late to go any where eles .
negative	this is the exact quote from her email , "$ 000 is the cost without the price match . $_00 is what i am in a los for the $_00 is my profit which i will give up if we can agree to the $_00 . i am unable to go this low when i said i will do off $_00 i didn ’ t realize that the order already has_been pricematched to a place where is below my cost .
positive	all in all hard to beat .
negative	i had to send it and pay the shipping_costs .
neutral	so i would have to know more about the item before ordering .
negative	the website will take your money even if the item is not in stock and then apoligize by stating they don_'_t have it .
neutral	so , no part , no real review except slow shipping
positive	i told all my friends and they use it to
negative	i was extremely disappointed with the service .
negative	it '_s been a week now and my vehicle is still missing the parts it needs and i have heard absolutely nothing from them .
neutral	the bonsal catylic converter did not fit exactly to my 00 chevy suburban , i had to modify the flange bolt plate to make them thinner and the holes longer ,
positive	thank_you for making this an easy purchase ipromo and jason mitan .
negative	for years i have struggled with your support .
negative	they are a rip_off .
positive	really can '_t fault transferwise .
negative	this is certainly a case of clever photography and product description because the difference_between what was expected and what was delivered could not have been wider .
positive	couldn_'_t find the product as cheap anywhere_else have been buying outdoor_equipment from this shop for a number of years and have never been_disappointed with there prices delivery and on the odd_occasion returns . staff very helpful when ive needed to ask questions about a stock item . well_done keep_up the good work

negative	:( it '_s so frustrating .
negative	good luck making that up to my family .
neutral	the flowers on their website look deceiving , the actual flower is never as big , as colorful ( they overused photoshop ) as fresh as it looks online .
negative	if you miss your flight or need to change you cannot just simply make the change , even four hours ahead of the flight as my daughter tried to do for me when i went into shock .

neutral	so in that case , i returned the shower_tower and would like to be credited to my account .

positive	took about 0 week to arrive .
neutral	luckily they corrected him .
neutral	i expected the trophy to come in a case not a cardboard_box stuffed with polystyrene and for the plaque to be stuck on straight , not enough time now to send it back to be straightened .
neutral	again - information i had provided when i booked the car .
neutral	i probably will only call the hotels directly in the future to avoid this confusion .
neutral	that '_s all i want to know .
neutral	i like neronte product
neutral	i do not think you should have to pay shipping charge on a core_return .
neutral	this was a really cute shirt but so small i couldn_'_t get both arms in - and this was a large !
neutral	there is a separate lens with the prescription , that snaps into the nose of the glasses .
negative	but instaed of the poster or an_apology - i get a ' here is your money back ' email .
neutral	so one of the manager was there to assist the next_day , she wasn_'_t that charismatic , you could tell that she just want us in and out .
positive	after that it worked like_clockwork i just rang them as directed and the car was picked_up and returned without_delay .
negative	poor customer_service in when purchasing and very rude customer_service ( the supervisor was nice and accommodating ( once someone finally connected us ).
negative	the experience i have just had was a bad one .
neutral	i am very pleased with the jacket & the price i paid .
positive	the ordering was easy , my call was returned promptly when i had a question , and my lobsters arrived exactly when they were promised .
negative	it wasn_'_t very clear at the time of purchase as being used .
neutral	plan not to recommend to others .
neutral	i love shopping on mcm but find it hard to believe that the shipping_charges are so much being that centerville is only an_hour or so from columbus .
negative	it '_s too bad that oldies . com can '_t deliver what they say they have to sell .
neutral	i wont be purchasing from boohoo again too much hassle have to pay for delivery , slow returns process and the £ 0 . 00 re - stocking_fee is just a little too greedy for me .
positive	my opinion reflect everything i had to say !
negative	this site is full of crap .
neutral	communication was ok . not happy with the time it took to make and deliver them , even_though plenty of time was given they still seemed unconcerned about them getting here before the wedding date .
neutral	so now i have all this glass
neutral	found that the service did not run as often as it was claimed to do

neutral	i '_ve always found this a good website and very helpful .
neutral	i felt i was getting a good price for the items i ordered .
positive	thanks
positive	if you are going to travel , shipsticks . com is the only option you need to consider .

neutral	when he wasn_'_t there , i called the office and they asked me who i picked_up the car from ?!
negative	no one answers the phone when you call them .
positive	the parts were exactly as_described , the shipping was prompt and i couldn_'_t have been happier with this purchase . unless of course it was free :-)
negative	we have received no satisfaction from them whatsoever and have contacted the bbb .
negative	no explained art of customer_service and asked them to look at my account no . more training i think if you are going to be in the customer_service centre and do well joanna !!!
positive	i was provided emails for tracking delivery of my wall safe and received it with no problem .
negative	havde posten været her 0 timer senere havde det passet med nøjagtig 0 døgns levering .
negative	she the made excuses and put the phone down .

neutral	where are my old bully_sticks ?
positive	found what i needed on - line .
positive	shipping was crazy fast too !
positive	very happy with my order .
neutral	i tried to see if i could amend my first order to add the second one but it had already been processed and i was advised i would need to submit it in a separate order .
negative	[_cathy ] that may have been the case last_week ,
positive	the products are fashionable with high_quality .
positive	wife now very happy she is staying in a favourite hotel and the credit goes to easytobook . com
neutral	if it weren_'_t for having a non_- refundable room , i definitely would have checked out and went to another hotel .
neutral	the delivery men although polite and left no mess , they failed to notice the two strips of wood protecting the bottoms of the upper unit sides .
neutral	they do not allow you to cancel or change your order once it is placed , even before it begins processing .
neutral	when i booked our room on travelocity , i specifically stated that there would be two adults and four children .
positive	the website is easy to navigate , the products are always good quality and delivered very quickly and when i needed to return a batch the refund process was really simple .
positive	you have a new customer for a long time now .
neutral	they charge 0 - 0 % for the pleasure .
negative	i also don_'_t wish to have the items " rushed " and be made with " negligence ".
neutral	she said they were in the hands of usps and i understand you have no control over that , but i should have tracking_information .
neutral	i was stunned to open the box of goodies for my dog to see it was crawling with ants !
positive	any age . any time . this tour delivers bang for your buck !
positive	i '_m so glad this is getting more popular and there is plenty of variety out there for brands , scents and methods .
positive	we purchased a two day pass so we could take our time and see as many sites as possible in a slower paced setting .
positive	i am always pleased with their extensive in stock selection and amazing communication , service and fast delivery .
neutral	printing quality is good but the stitching quality is not so good .
neutral	but everytime i get my box its opened when i get it and none of my other packages are ever like that .
neutral	on one occasion i purcahsed a deal for a wax treatment from salon 000 in acton , and was refused service and accused of lying about making an_appointment despite following the instructions given on the wowcher .
positive	very happy with the labels !
positive	the site is easy to use and the ordering and delivery procedures worked like_clockwork .
positive	good communication from boiler_juice via_e_- mails , always kept well informed .
negative	my phone had always been in a case and only had a tiny scuff on one edge .
negative	at the bottom part of the stone there is a white facet break that is visible to the eye making it an i0 .
positive	ein bisschen skeptisch war_ich ja .
negative	i understand that " rules are rules " but i would have hoped to have been listened to and at_least met half way .
neutral	tried to contact customer service could not get through .
negative	i will never order from them again .
negative	jeg_vil sgu ikke betale for en vare jeg_ikke_har bedt om og_jeg sender den enda retur hvad kan de forlange !
negative	it took around 00_minutes .
negative	they lost another customer tonight !!!!
negative	le prestataire m ' appel comme prévu et m ' informe qu ' il livrera le mercredi dans_la matinnée .
negative	but my first order from was a mistake and i notified you of the wrong order and you did nothing to correct it .
positive	this is a great way to get what you want and what you need at a good price with fast , fast service .
positive	i order from b_&_h because they typically have what i need in stock , delivery is fast and the products are always excellent .
neutral	i find this very dissappointing as this was a birthday_gift and don_'_t expect a £_00 bouquet to last less_than 00hours .
positive	as a mom of special needs twins i ordered supplies at a great price and great quality
neutral	overall , the stay was a pleasant_experience .
positive	i will also recommend them to friends .
neutral	daags voordien de_bestelling geplaatst voor_de_dag erop ( voor 00h ).
positive	can '_t do better_than that !
neutral	i placed the case in a closet where i keep the food and the jackets hanging in the closet , picked_up the odor , so i sprayed fabreze to try and get_rid of the odor .
negative	i informed wowcher and they haven_'_t got back to me about this and it has_been 0 days now .
negative	but delivery is complete disaster .
negative	!
negative	after this unhappy exchange i then again called the original travelocity contact number , got another agent , briefly explained the situation , got put on hold , was connected to another agent , re - explained the situation , requested access to someone in a supervisory capacity , provided my telephone_number , and was told a supervisor would call me back and i was " next up ."
negative	what a way to pay or not pay for my room .
negative	the explanation said if it doesn_'_t come in within 00 days from the original order being shipped , it will be cancelled .
neutral	i have returned the book to jessops but have received no reply to date .
negative	i booked and had confirmation of the fit hotel in nyc and when i arrived they had no knowledge of my reservation and they were full .
negative	ups showed they screwed_up my address so it was returned .
positive	excellent .
neutral	have it on my receipt / order confirmation and everything , but when i opened the product it was labeled as the 0000 model !
neutral	i would love to be able to get and receive gift_cards electronically if so desired vs having to go through the torture of the mail and having to have someone sign for it on the other end .
negative	so i needed a room last_minute .
neutral	but if you want to divert from the narrow path , you ' re in for some obstacles .
positive	good product and good service
neutral	it '_s understandable that items that are in too poor condition are rejected , but the seller loses out altogether - no payment , and no cd or dvd , but no_explanation .
neutral	i '_m really disappointed with this and contacted homebase via_email yesterday to discuss this but still_waiting for a response .
negative	ironically they gave_me the same seats .
negative	the second one actually connects you through some kind of a modem .
positive	they called me because they had a question on my order and i got very friendly service !
negative	hope you have better luck than me .
neutral	perhaps some training would be advantageous .
positive	queries have been sorted without_delay .
neutral	then , i went back and clicked on the details button and it mentions that basically nothing of weights ( bars , kb , med ball , etc ) are included in the promo .
positive	great products and the shipping is worth the price because of the deals you get .
negative	they treat you like you are a child , they do nothing but give you the run around and they love to delay things further by taking_advantage of the time zone difference_between the us and the uk , where they actually operate .
positive	she orders
positive	i had a question about the rails when the packages arrived so i called american_rv and got my answer .
neutral	it all too common today that no matter who you order parts from the packaging is horrendous .
positive	easy , shame local firms cannot offer a good price when you ring around .
neutral	when the item was delivered , ( very promptly ) it was the old version , which was a lower spec .
negative	we booked a room at the comfort_inn in pegion forge tn for a friday_night and the the reservation was made for sat .
positive	spoke to customer_services to get help and got an impartial and useful view .
negative	would i buy from you again no at this moment in time .
neutral	the delivery drivers were very professional and the products themselves are of good quality .
neutral	another little annoyance was that we could not find the courtesy telephone in the airport baggage area .
negative	i received 0 email cancellations so i am calling today to see if i actually have a reservation for the correct days of 0 to 0 april .
neutral	so townfair , stop advertising a free alignment if your company policy is to only do a 0 wheel_alignment .
neutral	sometimes it takes several emails to resolve an issue so a week can go by before a problem is resolved .
positive	as a lyoness member , i am thrilled your company is a benefit .
positive	ordered mid_afternoon , arrived the next_day .
negative	of ourse after 0 hours nobody called me !
neutral	so not door to door and damaged boxes .
neutral	i know there are some sites that have coupons or gift_cards or something they can utilize at the hotel .
negative	their cs fought me over $ 0 , and i even did a charge back which they fought and i am still out the shipping .
positive	i didn_'_t spend extra to have it there so quickly . it was out the door once my payment was made !
neutral	it '_s a tough tough foam that fills these chairs and it tends to firm up using available air very quickly .
neutral	currently shows that i have bit - defender loaded twice , this is how it all started !!
positive	great service . great selection !
positive	quality part .
negative	from you all !
neutral	this error did result in some inconvenience as the repair was critical for the holiday .
neutral	), with no guidance on how i might now proceed to trim the pieces correctly to ensure proper fitment of the footpegs .
neutral	delivery of my purchases was fast so i have no problem there .
positive	they have a good selection of low - cost dvds , coupled_with prompt and reliable delivery .
positive	thanks echo_supplements
positive	hi , mate have you ever_dealt_with ironmongary direct , you have , nt .

positive	it couldnt have been easier to order and find just what i was looking for in the world of dog_food there are so many_choices and mr_chewy had them all .
positive	would gladly reccomend to others
negative	i ordered to many by accindent but could not get a response from you .
neutral	previous_orders have been faster .
negative	take your own risk purchasing with them .
neutral	i love the parasols but if i find another company that has easier returns then i will not use luna bazaar again .
negative	expect over an_hour before your call is even answered .
negative	i then had to wait another thirty_minutes for shuttle to arrive .
positive	the site is beautiful , easy to navigate and loads of good product information .
positive	petflow . com has helped_me tremendously as i go through dog_food so quickly having 0 hungry old english sheepdogs .
positive	the entire_process was stress_free because of clear , dependable communications_throughout .
neutral	dog_food arrived quickly but was packaged poorly .
positive	i always know that i will get what i want when i order from b_&_h .
positive	fantastic range of tyres at a great price .
neutral	i love the home delivery but the box has_been coming apart and food spilling out when i recieve the shipment .
positive	no_problems - nice maw sit sit
negative	however , because my dualboot is 0 installations on 0 hard_disk drives , they refuse to help .
positive	i just love love love the clothes !
neutral	they were recommended to me so i didn_'_t expect any_problems .
neutral	also the other catheter had a coude tip which is easier to use .
neutral	i don_'_t have the time to receive an item , its not what i wanted or perceived and then i have to call the company , get a return number hear all the " we are so sorry ( we f && ked up your order ) excuses ", then repack it and go stand in line at the post_office to mail it back .
positive	can '_t fault anything at all with the service , delivery , cost or products 00 / 00
positive	lowest_prices on the market !
neutral	the empty space in the bigger box was filled with paper so the air_filter box wouldn_'_t shift position during shipment i guess .
neutral	i couldn_'_t wait for my rx_sunglasses to arrive , and now i '_m completely self_conscious about putting them on .
neutral	i thought the poster is really nice , but a little too expensive .
neutral	however , this time , i was surprised to see a higher price than_expected .
negative	suddenly i started getting refunds for the things i had ordered , without a word of explanation .
neutral	thanks anyway but i wondered_why it took so long to get the part delivered .
negative	it took me over 0 minutes to get through to someone_who told me my parcel had been delivered to a neighbour but they had no record of which one .
positive	arrived in a couple of days via yodel .
neutral	need a personal relationship when you are trying to clean up your credit up .
positive	great product g ood price
neutral	?.
neutral	i think they either should of let_me know that via an e_-_mail or shipped what they could of the order and the last cd separately .
neutral	reordered the part , received the right part ,
neutral	host profiles show stars for categories such as check in , communication , overall satisfaction .
negative	i was not refunded the full_amount i was supposed to .
neutral	the lady said no problem it was the person_who took my details hadn_'_t processed them properly .
negative	it is installed in a sun room as a replacement for a similar fan .
positive	escapade is now the first place i look when i need a fancy_dress costume , i '_ll definitely but from them again .
negative	shop the wrong part even when you tell them it is wrong and make you pay return shipping and restocking_fee .
neutral	quite disappointing .
negative	then in red letters it said not to reply to the email and it gave_me a return number .
neutral	i received a pack of thin grips that is useless and this just made me even angrier .
positive	plenty of email_updates about the delivery
neutral	winter_tyres bought at a great price bottom_line .
neutral	i will not use again .
negative	hertz , where the package was supposedly not collected from , has confirmed that on the day in question , a courier showed_up , showed them a docket with my name on it and collected the package .
neutral	i had booked a " lock and low " deal for $_00 a day - what a great price !
negative	i expected to receive water_bottle_labels for my daughter '_s first birthday_party with her picture on it .
negative	alright finally a month later i receive the call that the furniture is in .
positive	she wears it every day .
negative	additionaly , i found a clothes hook bent close to the car ( it looked like if it was used to open the car ).
negative	then i asked again where they where and they sent back an_email for a return of both side turning lamps -- which i only got 0 -- how does this work ?
negative	refused to refund me after the shimano 000 chain that i purchased from them broke within 0 miles .
neutral	i certainly won_'_t be using the branch in chorley again that '_s for certain .
negative	plus the money for the first flight i '_m out .
positive	and the lenses came quickly !
negative	like i said before great parts and lots of then for a fair price .
negative	so therefore i am going to call the centre , which i did and was informed it would be posted out that day .
negative	i didn_'_t receive my order so no birthday_present my my daughter , unacceptable , won_'_t risk buying ever again .
negative	shame that they have resorted to this kind of practice because the shower_valve is actually of a good quality .
negative	if you book and cancel , they will delay refunds for a month or more .
negative	i will probably not order from partsgeek in the future since it takes so long to get the product .
negative	i placed my order on 0 / 00 / 00 and was told it shipped on 0 / 00 / 00 however didn_'_t receive order until 0 / 00 / 00 .

positive	i was really pleased to receive my order so quickly .
positive	and i must_say totally happy so_far with service and ease of use of the site .
neutral	ended_up buying from germany which including delivery was cheaper_than getting it in britain ( how strange )
negative	post questions on items page , they don_'_t put up the question .
negative	with that being said , here is my order number :_0000000 .
negative	of course by 00 : 00 there was no sign of the delivery .
negative	just waited 00_minutes on hold , only for a recording to come on , tell me to use the online support system and hung_up .
positive	ordered men '_s shoes one afternoon and they arrived the next_day .
neutral	to be fair it arrived at around_0pm but why txt to say it '_s coming but email when it '_s not .
neutral	i am going to pheonix mesa on oct 00th - 00th .
positive	i have used travelocity many_times and find it very easy to use .
negative	i woud recive them with à present .
negative	despite talking to ' customer_services ' twice , to be given cool robot unhelpful repetition , all they would do is put me through to the delivery guys , who told me the same .
positive	still has the best results , but their new privacy_policy of tracking people everywhere they go on the web is a little too big brother .
negative	usd per_night extra for our 00 year_old daughter , even_though the hotel ’_s policy was children under 00 stay for free .
negative	i tried_calling the phone_number you listed in an_email to me for this review .
negative	i understand that the problem may or may not have been theirs , but as a service provider it should always be their problem to assist in solving a customer '_s problem .
positive	i am very happy that i found your site .
positive	good quality and excellenent service .
neutral	however , i am quite disappointed with the optical quality of these particular glasses .
neutral	overall , an ok tour but didn_'_t feel we got value for money .
negative	it is not worth the " savings " if you ask me .
positive	i was highly satisfied with your service .
neutral	avast '_s support for scanning encrypted email connections is braindead .
negative	it was said that i was promised an exchange only to be told later that i was wrong and that the website had described the item i received correctly and was them given a refund after instead of an exchange .
neutral	d ' autre part , la_qualité d ’ impression n ' est_pas extraordinaire .
positive	if they are representative of the entire staff i don_'_t know what more one could ask for .
negative	i already spent a whole week and did not receive even a rma yet .
positive	great job eurocar / auto_europe !
negative	i think the packages the books come in is horrible .
neutral	some other things they slid in there .
positive	fast delivery of hard to find parts at a great value .
negative	i called many_times , but certain hours they can just look up information and can '_t do any sort of tracking .
positive	using standard delivery the parcel arrived well_protected and the next_day .
negative	i waited in on the wednesday for the delivery as requested and imagine my surprise when i was telephoned and informed that the delivery could not be made that day and it would now be thursday " would that be alright ?"
positive	a couple of days after the boots were in france : a fantastic ,

neutral	unfortunately customer_service is not their strong suit .
positive	just trying to show me how much they know about cars .
positive	said it would be 0 bus days and it came in 0 !
positive	it has_been a pleasure_doing_business with this location & will keep_coming here .

neutral	during the trip the smaller car performed well and our return experience was excellent .
negative	so , what up with your company .
positive	it is now installed and giving great reception and picture quality .
neutral	i love my sunglasses , but they are not the " gold " color as_described and advertised on the website .
positive	you will not find better prices anywhere and believe me i tried , don_'_t look for the rest just buy from the best !!
neutral	i '_m tired of being charged 00 $ for a 00 $ meal !
neutral	sincerely , bill spahr

negative	parts_geek sent the same part and charged my account for it even_though they said it was unavailable .
negative	got recommended from family_member , i will not be doing the same .
neutral	i have received over 00 reviews all 0_stars but one 0_star for check in and my listings sometimes do not show up in search or are penalized against other listings with worst reviews than mine and airbnb will not explain_why .
positive	a discapito di molte recensioni trovate su internet io mi_sono trovato_benissimo .
negative	customer_services is a joke .
negative	wasted entire morning for someone to turn up , no - one did .
positive	they are my go - to company for all my shaving_supplies .

negative	i have emailed on my own email , through paypal and tried to ring them and no answer to any of them and no replies .
positive	the curtains arrived sooner_than_expected and are of an excellent quality .
negative	obviously that '_s the phony scratch that '_s always there , on every rental_car , to charge unwitting customers , one after another .
neutral	it ended_up costing be much more because i was misled about the cot .
neutral	had a hard job convincing them to price match even_though they ' d let_me down on my first choice .
negative	i placed my order three_weeks_ago and did not realize that supplement_warehouse did not honor prices from amazon . com , since they are " not a vitamin competitor ."
neutral	i wouldn_'_t like this job , lots of annoyed customers i would imagine .
negative	the only problem i had was it was missing a passengerside bracket to mount it .
negative	when you get stiffed by a seller , they will tell you it is a paypal matter .
positive	it was securely_packaged in a ups express pad pack and also placed in a cardboard carton .
neutral	i chose the mx00 for the plain easy to read dial ( day and night ) and i wasn_'_t disappointed here either .
negative	this is my second dealing_with this store using their on - line ordering service and my fisrt experience was dreadful .
neutral	i immediately looked up the hotel and the reviews to quickly be disappointed .

negative	items didn_'_t arrive
negative	i very excitedly opened the package only to find that they had sent me the driver '_s side taillight cover .

positive	called at 00 and had alarm service before 0 !
negative	so , now i am stuck with 0 pairs of sandals i do not want .
positive	lovely quality beach bag and playsuit - looked exactly how they did on the website .
negative	i investigated this driver and found out he was a failed taxi owners from tacoma .
neutral	due to work we are not getting our furniture for 0_weeks .
neutral	i think if ami added online_chat support , their customer service experience would be greatly_improved .
positive	a great selection of products at really competitive_prices - and i can collect points at the same time !
negative	it took me almost a week just to find out they don_'_t have the item in their warehouse ( after numerous of e_- mails and phone_calls ).
negative	but , of course , then you don_'_t have the value of the itunes_gift_card which you just paid for .
neutral	i hope that they can fix the web_site to accurately_reflect what is in the catalog .
negative	travelocity and jet_blue did not meet my needs in doing what i paid them to do .
negative	i honestly dont_know how this company has so many positive_reviews ( aside from the one that is one of their employees that is - coreleone ismail ).
positive	always professional , polite , and they get the job_done every time .
neutral	the price , however , was the best i found among all internet parts dealers .
negative	i say both because while paypay does own buy me later they refuse to take_responsibility for billing issues there .
negative	after that i saw how many money they took form me .
negative	i just got a email_saying they got the part back and should credit my account the price of the part .
positive	to find a company that will that would rather help you than to just take your money is rare .
negative	this order was place on sept . 00 , 00
negative	' it was on the job sheet so it should have been done '.
negative	despite_being barred and despite the <_external link_removed_> merger , i '_ve submitted the imei to this service since they promised to get it unlocked for an_additional_fee , since it was barred .
negative	when you treat_customers like dirt !
negative	i '_m so frustrated !
positive	we had an amazing tour_guide !
positive	ordered a gift 00pm at night . last_minute as usual , hoping it would be sent the next_day , but amazed that it arrived the very next_morning , so cant get any better_than that !
negative	not really .
neutral	it does take away from the fact that you are charged for the books the day you order them , so you lose nearly two_weeks of rental cost and don_'_t have any books to show for it .
negative	highly pissed . and have been waiting for a response from them , but nothing .
negative	i was never able to actually talk with some one - you keep sending incomplete emails to me that do nothing to answer my questions .
neutral	product was correct and worked well .
neutral	this isn_'_t something new so i was somewhat expecting it .
neutral	actual flowers were much less then how it was portrayed on the website
negative	i responded as such and received a note stating ups delivered them and did i receive the supplements , and if i wanted to ship the supplements back they can ship them to the correct address .
negative	the mailing had a time value , and contained an expensive brochure .
positive	good way to buy what you want when you want it , it '_s simple to use and great value too .
positive	the rep was extremely nice and told me what they could do for me .
neutral	telephone help line was unable to help during the build suggesting see what it was like when it was finished .
neutral	service - no_issues to report
neutral	this webstore is one of the best , but still need to improve some problems with worldwide sells .
negative	not acceptable .
neutral	because of gaps bolts were too short and springs to long .
neutral	however , i met great resistance not only with the texas dps , but also with the social_security administration office for it '_s acceptance .
negative	i also follow their page on facebook and they are always posting new products and things all throughout the day but they can '_t make_sure that their customers are being taking_care of first .
negative	and than . after several days , this week i received a email from managerservices informing " applied refund "!!!!
positive	would suggest this company to anyone .
neutral	we were offered a replacement , but the hassel of re - arranging another day off work to wait for the item wasn_'_t worth it .
positive	i purchased reading and sunglassess ( both prescription ) sooooo nice and more !
negative	i hope you will contact me regarding this matter .
neutral	men supporteren siger dog , at jeg_kan kontakte msi , og_hvis_jeg_kan_få god fra_dem , vil komplett . dk sende mig et_nyt kort , hvis_jeg_får en e_-_mail fra msi om at det_er ok , så msi kan sende et_nyt kort til komplett . dk .
negative	i wanted to change my flight , and tried for two_days to get in touch with bravofly by e_-_mail and phone , and was not able to get any contact at all .
neutral	luckily , i had the opportunity to edit the review to the 0_stars that they deserved .
negative	i had to spell the name of the hotel several_times and have the dates and repeated over and over my requests .
neutral	white roses a bit brown on the edges
negative	then 00_minutes later , i was assured all was peachy with my all - inclusive in mexico , only to arrive the next_day with my room given away for ' no - showing '.
positive	but it was my replacement parts for my car .
neutral	it should have been spot on .
negative	i refused , but despite that they put the charge through on the cc # on file for my auto - ship order and then had the nerve to charge me a ridiculous shipping fee for that single 0 pound_bag because it was rushed .
positive	ordering was very straight_forward .
positive	can '_t beat the geek ,
negative	the fee is high if you only earn $_000 or less ( 00 %).
positive	he looks at me as if i am a moron .
neutral	i needed the items i ordered on a very short timeline and the website made it very easy for me to do the design and order process quickly from my computer .
positive	there , amazingly , we found the molarcelan equivalents , that are totally compatible with our electric toothbrushes .
positive	it was great .
neutral	use wisely and read the toc closely .
negative	they take your money right_away , but slow to issue rma '_s to return core .
positive	!
negative	when i did , they just told me they ' d credit my account .
neutral	i have to leave the site , refresh and even close safari altogether .
negative	i have not yet been to the hotel and hope that the people there will make my experience worthwhile , so i cannot_comment on the hotel experience yet .
positive	in both_cases , i got exactly_what i was looking for , and i got it at a price that beat everybody_else .
positive	fast shipping and great customer_service !
negative	i have requested the total amount back .
positive	impressed by lenstore , original order didnt arrive and they sent another batch out special delivery the day after i spoke to them .
positive	im so surprised at how fast i received my pkg , thank_you , i will buy from you again .
positive	the search brought up exactly_what i needed i got my storage_unit same day !
negative	then they ask me for photos and ship back for store credit which is focusing me to shop with them again .
negative	they were cheap fabric , not the suede that shoes are usually made of .
neutral	the bidding is fun to me .
negative	not so .
positive	i had a great experience with passport visa express - and they have e_- promo_codes for 00 dollars off your order ( how cool is that !).
negative	i believe it is going to make a big_difference for everybody , especially when there are lots of intelligent people out there and not everyone is an_idiot .
negative	well i got the package opened it there was the crank pulley along with the woodruff key but no bolt as said in the description and shown in the image .
neutral	however i was able to get the dominos elsewhere and only 00 miles_away .
negative	my wife cancelled an_appointment to get home to receive the parcel which didn_'_t arrive .
positive	the rewards_program is good idea and appears to be better value than most other_places .
negative	and whenever i emailed i was told i had to wait 00 working days before i could query it !!
positive	he was professional and down to earth !
positive	great information , fast delivery , product arrived as specified and in excellent condition .
negative	i have filed several claims and have yet to talk or be contacted by anyone .
neutral	i ordered a starter from parts_geek and they were extreamly fast in processing and shipping out my order .
negative	i had to order from another seller .
positive	great range and top service , just what you need !!
negative	i purchased round_trip flight tickets along with the cancellation insurance .
positive	thank_you
negative	when the second phone arrived it was better_than the first one but still showed signs of sim_card usage .
neutral	so they had to come out and put it back on correctly with screws .
positive	very satisfied with the part .
neutral	and the one bag of treats that i opened .
neutral	luckily they weren_'_t even aware of all the available seats and we got on the flight but then our_luggage somehow got to madison earlier_than us and wasn_'_t on the belt so there was some searching around .
neutral	i bought the clutch_kit , the ad said to purchase the install tool separate .
negative	they shipped the wrong part for one of the part they did ship .
positive	delivery times are fast and confirmation always sent .
positive	thank_you , ancestry .
neutral	will be sending back faulty cartridges for a refund as soon as i get the replacement ones that i ordered a week_ago .
negative	i called in after signing_up to make_sure they cancelled and did not bill my card .
positive	what a great set of wheels , light strong , competitively_priced and quick delivery .
neutral	but then a couple of days_later another kit arrived .
positive	easy to navigate and prices are always the lowest from other_sites !
neutral	i told the customer_service representative that i was leaving on vacation and needed the compression sleeve by a certain date .
negative	at this point i was panicking .
neutral	i received 0 emails from partsgeek in a matter of hours .
neutral	i just cross my fingers and hope there '_s no_problems .
positive	i scanned and emailed my receipt to square_trade and got a check in a week , no_bs or extra questions or trying to get out of paying the way a typical insurance company would , just the check .
positive	i set_up an account so i can either pay off instantly or pay in installments all great .
negative	and i forgot this part the most_important part they sent me to the wrong location !
negative	so , it happened to be graduation weekend and there were no flights to maui for 0 days !
positive	simplesite . com is easy to use and have a very attractive templates to choose .
negative	i bought 0 pairs of shoes .
positive	having used the site to book a number of different hotels
neutral	i do .
negative	i would strongly_suggest you book your travels with someone_else other than expedia !!!!!!!
positive	well i was looking hard for a job , your site was a great way to research where jobs were in my area .
negative	so i send out another and another associate takes my ticket and says they will fix it and still nothing .
neutral	the website was ok . only problem was locking onto the apartment pictures .
positive	i added some of my finishing_touches and was a hit of the party … and my date was very pleased … couldn ’ t keep his hand off of me .
neutral	as a user i don_'_t expect to have to backwards while completing a retail transaction .
neutral	so by paying for a cheaper book i didn_'_t get it as fast as i liked !
negative	i was never informed of the fine_print or clause in your reservation booking by the 0 email , and i was transferred around by them constantly and told i needed to speak with hotels . com and then back to expedia .
positive	deals excellent value have had no_problems with any of them so_far
neutral	he repeated himself over and over again and needed the same information repeated to him several_times .
neutral	you guys do a great job with the car and customer service , work on the insurance & hidden_fees .
neutral	also i '_m sure i chose not to receive newsletters and offers but i '_ve had loads of emails off this company since .
negative	they are robbing us blind .
positive	the prices are great and the free_shipping was an added_bonus .
negative	when i checked back , i saw that the order had been cancelled three_days after i made it and my money was refunded to my account .
negative	the left temple , however , was so tight that the spring did not activate ; when i try to open the left temple , it flexes the glasses in the bridge area .
neutral	i found the delivery and the bath to my satisfaction except for two missing feet which should have been in the delivery order but the plumber managed to bore holes in my old baths feet and we managed to fit it onto the new one . but all in all happy enough with the bath , which i havnt used yet as i havnt got round to wiring it up . will tell you once its up and going . regards
neutral	partsgeek has great products and prices .
positive	suntransfers again provided a great service .
neutral	i received part of my order and then looked to see where the rest of the order was after it hadn_'_t arrived for 0_weeks - there , after several clicks , i saw " back order ."
negative	now i know the word usually is prominent there but with the 00_% delivered the following_day that to me says that within 0 - 0 days 000_% that game is going to be on my doorstep .
positive	ink i bought from a local outfit did not work .
neutral	don_'_t think i '_ll be shopping at this site anymore .
neutral	they finally agreed they should remove them .
neutral	when i sent my books there was no damage to the binder and also one of the books was a teachers edition that obviously the college had sold my daughter but i would have no way of knowing that .
negative	today , august 00 , 0000 .
negative	---------------------------------------------------------------

negative	i called and their staff checked the website and admitted that there was a bug in the system and the error happened again .
neutral	when arriving at the parking facilities , the number plates of the car are supposed to be read automatically and again when leaving .
positive	even my cousin , the hostess of the reunion , was very grateful for my perseverance .
neutral	other than this i enjoy writing for and using trip_advisor to find new places .
negative	paid out money incorrectly and would not assist in recovering it .
neutral	this was namely because of tax that had been added even_though easytobook had not made it clear that this cost was not included in the price .
neutral	i have been waiting on a tuner for almost 0 week with little or no contact from jd i will never by from them agin
negative	i ordered green_coffee bean extract on may0 .

negative	bref , assurance normal , prix bas , service client nul .
negative	the website showed item in stock .
negative	i called again and new rep told me that i should be looking at a completely different number .
positive	in fact i wouldn_'_t shop anywhere_else for high end audio .
neutral	if you need folks to check the box again , would it not make_sense to situate it below the address fields rather_than above ?
positive	i had been shopping at another supplement store for a while and heard about supplementwarehouse and now i know i wont be buying my supplements anywhere_else .
positive	i would recommend this company .
negative	i asked the priceline rep , " if you had my experience , would you use priceline again ?"
negative	!
negative	since my return i have called and left messages for a month and i am fobbed_off each time i call .

neutral	it would have been nice to know this upon ordering the item .
positive	the days are just not long enough to see everything in detail , i think i needed 0 days on the bus .

neutral	all in all it cost me a week and a half and i ended_up paying them for return shipping .
positive	i sent 0 email_asking for a quote and information , i had a phone_call within 00_mins and emailed quote and pictures within 0 hour .
positive	it only too 0 days to mail the handset and receive the cheque .
neutral	bad thing about the site is you are paying a monthly_fee but you still have to pay to get up - dates credit_reports .
positive	i search every avaiable engine and this was the first one i tried and the cheapest .
neutral	thanks parts_geek , next time ill pay double the price in town and get it done in one day instead of one month .
negative	i tried to track down a telephone_number to call a customer_service representative , couldn_'_t find a number anywhere .
positive	gill in sunderland

positive	the photon_light that i ordered is a very nice quality piece of equipment .
neutral	oh , also all the gentleman working there were very , very nice .
neutral	i hope i recieve my order as planned this next month or i will find a new company to go through .
positive	just about to but some more :)
neutral	customer is starting to get mad over the whole_ordeal .
positive	i am totally delighted with the equipment chosen and cannot_fault at all the total purchasing experience .
negative	the company doesn_'_t have a phone contact number and they never answer by email on time .
negative	you don_'_t even deserve one star .
negative	but the really bad thing is that they don_'_t reply to complaints .
negative	they also stated to send my phone_number so they could call me !!
positive	easy to put_together just need to put the base on .
negative	i would now have no bed to sleep in when i came out of hospital and i would not be in a position to assemble one then , i was in a bad position , thanks to the incompetence of their logistics / buying / planning departments .
neutral	i have no_problems with the company or online sales experience , they ' re fine , but as they use citylink carriers i doubt i '_ll use them again .
negative	the delivery drivers had to be asked to put the cabinet together - rather_than just doing it and i had to gather up packaging so they would take it all away .
neutral	little did i know it was fedex .
positive	will order again and will refer you to anyone_who ask '_s .
neutral	the packaging was excellent and the furniture was received in good order , however upon inspection the mini side board was found not to have had the holes drilled to accept the shelf supporting brackets .
neutral	the information posted made it sound like i had to have just acquired another light and i now i was going to buy another ( after the fact that i had just bought one ).
positive	def use again - quality hoses
neutral	the nose thing to reduce snoring does not work .
negative	!
positive	very pleased made my order wednesday_afternoon it was delivered early next_morning .
positive	i was very happy with the process from start to finish and i love my new ring .
neutral	if the access was indeed temporary and just for the review , then the password should take me directly to my review and not make me search .
negative	i filed a paypal dispute as well as filing with the ftc against them .
negative	oh well i guess that is the way they do_business .
negative	the review of netcertlabs , although not glowing , was accurate .
neutral	however , after a phone_call , they were able to make things right .
positive	i absolutely cannot wait to order additional art with confidence , knowing this company is truly the best !
positive	no_hassles , it was awesome .
positive	i buy many items on - line from all over but this tops them all .
positive	its a great company to work with and is an_asset for my business .
positive	they sent me the exact piece i had asked for with very fast shipping .
positive	everything was in a good condition , clean , quite , the size was big enough , wifi worked correctly , big tv , balcony with views to the city , and the staff was kind , correct and punctual .
negative	instead , i was told because i made the reservation online myself it could have been an user error .
neutral	everything works well , the site is relatively easy to use but to organise results on price then add a booking_fee later is incredibly annoying .
neutral	every time i order something i have to fill in all my information . name , address , phone_number , email address .
positive	although he has not gone_through extensive training he instinctively knows my son is different and has a gentle way with him .
negative	whoever packaged them thought it was okay to fold the rolls of fabric in half , shove both rolls into a small square box , and proceed to shove the flower girl basket which was stored in a plastic box that is also now squished into one box .
negative	upon making the reservation over the phone the agent advised that payment didnt go through , which caused me to leave where i was and drive home to get my other credit_card .
neutral	i am a amazon_prime subscriber and i am considering having amazon deliver instead because of this policy .
negative	the shower panel i purchased was a direct replacement for one i purchased years_ago .
neutral	now if partsgeek would just man some phones .
negative	required email to get response as to how to return .
neutral	it looked as if it was new .
neutral	was unable to give an opinion
positive	:)
neutral	while the service i received yesterday was frustrating , his response alleviated my concerns .
neutral	that being said , i need to explain that the reason i could only give 0_stars is due to allowance by youtube of inappropriate content including nudity , profanity , and various raunchy postings and even reviews by others .
negative	0 .
positive	enables me to swiftly pay and collect funds from my customers .
negative	riverside have refused to simply arrange for the item to be collected and refunded as clearly requested by me ,( i have had it for 0 days ) advising me they have a strict code of conduct agreed with the manufacturer and i must send photos and they will tell me what happens next !
positive	i think the title_says it all
positive	very good provider .
positive	i had tried everywhere to get jars of cherries in kirsch to make a black forest gateaux , but everywhere except the whiskey_exchange said they only usually stocked it at christmas .
positive	i placed an on sunday_evening . it arrived as_promised 0 days_later on the tuesday .
negative	they already had proven that they can '_t pack an order -- what confidence would i have that they would pack the second order properly .
positive	very impressed with tyre_shopper with regards to price , only drove 00 miles on new tyres so cannot_comment on the tyres as yet .
positive	it seemed my order had arrived almost before i ' d had a chance to place it !
positive	i highly_recommend them .
negative	status of item
neutral	in this day and age one loves to be able to order things online and have them sent .
negative	i had ordered the wrong part and it took me three_days to get_ahold of partsgeek through to a representative .
negative	after consulting with a fico credit specialist , i realize the credit_scores you provide are not my true credit_scores and is therefore worthless to me . not to mention costly !
positive	always right part .
negative	my part arrived broken and my mechanic was scheduled 0 days out to replace it .
neutral	i replaced the new unit with the old unit & the engine started .
positive	i compared several sites and bookbyte made the highest offer .
neutral	it was shipped in the original thin_cardboard_box without an outer carton .
neutral	t - stat and belt came the next_day .
positive	the only place i ' d buy magnets from in the future
positive	happily_recommend ziffit to other_users .

neutral	looks like not for the date i wanted , but still it should have been no more than the $_000 minus 00_% as_advertised .
positive	while i have been less_than satisfied with actions by airlines used , i have never had a bad_experience with travelocity .
negative	well , today is dec . 00st and i still do not have my gift_cards .
positive	delivery was on time and as_promised .
negative	00th_oct i got an_email_saying the tap was found to be damaged in the warehouse ( a common excuse looking at other reviews ) and that they were out of stock even_though they were still selling it online .
positive	i was furious as it was a valentine '_s gift .
neutral	surely they could split the box into two .
neutral	after calling & being told to send an_email for 00 hr .
neutral	and the trip is still four months away .
neutral	the wellies arrived within a reasonable time .
negative	search the fender , input with year ( 0000 ) and correct model , and the invoice and receipt describe the same information .

positive	i look_forward to dealing_with him again .
positive	friendly service , a little costly but you will get your passport on or before the requested date ( got mines in 0 business days and i was expecting 0 ) .
neutral	still , best value out there .
positive	i purchased my dog through a breeder last_year for the sole reason of providing a companion for my autistic son .
neutral	the old town trolley '_s ( a competing company ) seemed to pick_up passengers much faster and all of their tours are human narrated .
positive	not one to go over the top but the fact that i use this firm time after time speaks_volumes in my view .
negative	the wrong shoes were sent to me .
neutral	a lot of on - line retailers such as asos and new look are allowing customers to post return items via collect plus which is great as it allows you to return the item via newsagents , petrol stations near you and you can track the item to .
neutral	j ' ai du légèrement nettoyer la coque avant de_l ' offrir .
positive	very easy to find hotels , good brief description & over everything else great price !!
positive	i have never bought this kind of items before , the service was fast and painless .

positive	they even offered to check my order prior to shipping to them .
negative	of course it was , the wrong picture was on their site .
positive	alpha - brain proved to be far_superior to the 0 - hour shot , which was having adverse effects on me .
positive	exavault most closely replicates the experience of private server administration .
negative	so reordered & paid but dont refund for severel days so went overdrawn & to top it off the refund was less_than what i had to pay for the same items . wish i could cancel & go elsewhere but it will take too_long to get all the monies returned , my advice buy local and save_yourself the hassle .
positive	my dinner was a success and i '_m a happy_camper .
neutral	midway through the third year my laptop began crashing .

negative	0 .
positive	cheap prices
positive	wonderful and fast service - quite unique in this day and age !
positive	i was very impressed with my own_labels .
neutral	firstly , the distance from the airport to the car_hire was a 00 minute bus journey , but worse still was the fact that the buses only went every half_hour ( no details of the bus times were provided at the time of booking ).
neutral	i do not think you should advertise what you don_'_t have or what you can '_t get .
neutral	a few_days_later , i received another package , with a new case ( which i hadn_'_t ordered , it was wrongly delivered ), but still no skin .
positive	faster_than the parts store down the street could get it in !
neutral	not happy .

neutral	very disappointed with the service .
negative	i shall not be using sky one ever again .
negative	their advertisement sound so promising , but you will be seriously disappointed !
positive	turkey was not done on time .
neutral	pick_up at airport was unsufficient .
positive	there are times when the product has strange material or is a little different from the picture but it is nothing you wouldn_'_t experience on any other site .

neutral	i ordered two books at the same time and i got one within 0 days and the other one didn_'_t come for 00 days .

negative	they didnt work .
neutral	while i was happy to have found a flight online with better timings ( and an ever - so - slightly better price ) than i was being offered over the phone during my 0 hours worth of conversation to travel_agents , there is one thing i would like to share so that other customers are aware .
neutral	he was polite , knowledgeable and very helpful .
negative	i guess the lesson is use expedia in the first place .
positive	convenient and informative
neutral	the eticket was not issued for a day after the payment .
positive	i ordered an a0 hardback photobook , printed on glossy pages , the outcome is ( as the title suggests ) stunning !!!
neutral	they should just say on the website that if * they * determine that you have too many books to fit in one box , they '_ll send you another shipping label .
neutral	had i realized that , i may have searched other venues to book .
positive	i don_'_t need to worry_about the dangers of candles or if the spray contains harmful chemicals .
neutral	she contacted diriveaway the next_day and obviously sorted it out with them .
neutral	order was march 00 0000

negative	i can not do it alone , i have to spend some money on this .
negative	this just got too silly for me ad i was not going to go through further procedure - crap with this customerservice , so i cancel the order .
neutral	a size 00 is not an 0 a 00 is an 0 so were miles too small and i can '_t afford to send them back .
neutral	having stars published on every user profile ( guest or host ) would also help the better guests have better experiences on airbnb , not just help hosts .
negative	i was booked and made reservations without ever being told that it was expedia .
negative	this looks_like a scam to me to keep your core_deposit .
negative	what a absolute joke there customer_services are & why_advertise that you can deliver to places when you can '_t ?
negative	in fairness i did not let ps know because there would not have been time to return it and have it back before the wedding .
positive	however , i had a good experience with hotwire .

negative	we had a terrible experience there .
neutral	i have been waiting literally for over six_months for the 000 count of igg0000 , which i take daily , to come in .
neutral	it took another 0 phone_calls - with them telling us they would call back and never doing so , to being told the lights had been dispatched on their standard delivery adding another 0 days to us eventually receiving the replacements .
neutral	i guess my problems have been mostly down to me being really busy and finding it difficult to hold in mind the end of deal dates , though i don_'_t think that has_been exclusively true .
neutral	i think that it should be made clear when you order exactly how many days until delivery are expected , and if there is a delay due to a prescription for pet_food .
positive	my experience is very good , the price are excellent , excellent the product also , i recommend 000_% at all my friends and family .

negative	i used the portal from the billmelater website to get the promotional 0 % cashback - and i don_'_t know if that was the problem or it was the bookit website itself - but it took_forever to get from one field to the next to fill_out the form - and i gave up yesterday trying to get this in .

positive	thank_you , will_definately recommend :)
negative	why am i pist off ?
positive	the products were excellent value for money and the promo_codes on offer for referrals etc are very generous and worthwhile taking_advantage of .
negative	and to add_insult to injury , their call_centre attempted to add an £ 0 charge when i called ( the number they provided ) to pay for the policy .

negative	this is the worst service that i have ever received and will not ever shop with this website again !
negative	i booked my room on this site to attend my brothers wedding .

neutral	for example 00 pack of quaver crisps was 00 pack .
positive	i have recommended this site to lots of my friends who enjoy luxury at a fair price , great service and upgrades if available at no additional_cost .
neutral	however , the car had many scratches and dings when we picked it up , and upon return the employees tried to tell us we had caused a couple of them .

neutral	one of our parts cracked within two months .

neutral	website just wasn_'_t up to date enough with the garage slots .
negative	they just assumed and made a quote most_likely because they where to busy .

positive	goods ordered were received within 00_hours and gave a considerable saving on showroom prices
neutral	the bearing set i ordered and received turned_out to be a special type of bearing that '_s designed to deal with damaged axle bearing surface area .

positive	i loved that i could do everything on line .
neutral	had petflow communicated the stockout before they shipped , i may have elected to change the size or order another item .
neutral	simply_scuba seemed unable to give me any resaaurance as to how this data would be handled , what level of security would be used , who would have access to it or what procedures would be used to delete it .
neutral	they deal with the host and act as liaison - you do nothing but book and relax , right ?

neutral	walmart is closer , faster delivery .
neutral	it was just a shame that it took 0_weeks for them to tell me that my first , second and 0rd choices of a couple of the products advertised on their website were actually unavailable .
neutral	however , after i received credit for being sent the wrong part i had to re - order the item and was charged shipping again --- so , i ended_up paying for shipping twice for a part that when first delivered was the wrong part .
negative	i did not stay at this motel because the a /_c was not operational , the door would not lock , the tv set looked like it was built in the 0000 '_s and it was filthy and smelled_like crap .
neutral	the personal contact with the customer_service representatives was good , but all of the representatives i spoke with said they would send me an e_- mail along with the information on what i needed to do to return the first part i purchased to get my core_charge returned .
neutral	i can find brands here that aren_'_t carried by the larger pet product distributors and customer_service is terrific , however the search and filter functions on the website need a major overhaul and the number of marketing and deal emails is overwhelming .
negative	alt startede som sædvanligt godt , men siden har det været_en absolut ustabil og til tider horribel kundeservice_og kundemindedhed .
negative	and the hotel is surely right about the fact that not every junior_suite has a jacuzzi , in fact i think it '_s possible that only the senior suites do actually have a jacuzzi .

neutral	my mechanic will be the final judge .
negative	most of which were started on expedia '_s end .
neutral	i am satisfied with the product but the whole_process could have been much less_stressful if the delivery company did put a little extra_effort to try and contact me on the initial day of delivery , and if the relevant notification emails came on time .
neutral	non_ho nulla di che lamentarmi tranne a riguardo dei tempi_di_consegna che_sono troppo lunghi
negative	paid for next_day delivery which did not happen and did not arrive the day after that .

neutral	bought a lot from cotswold , always good products .

neutral	i used travelocity for the first time recently and booked a one way airline_ticket on silver airways .
neutral	after i paid to have the part installed , removed , repaired and re - installed , this turned_out to be a very expensive part .
negative	eventually after writing several follow_up emails they agreed to grant me a voucher for free delivery on my next order , which , in comparison to the value i lost from the delivery charges and discount_code was nothing more than a slap in the face .
positive	speedy_delivery .
negative	at the overseas airport , there was no assistance at all and chaos with wheelchair assistance wouldn_'_t have looked out of place in ' father ted or little britain '
positive	three_months of tasting through the options i have bought for them and now we are almost ready to settle on our monthly order .
neutral	regrettably you didn_'_t inform_me .
negative	because i elected car_rental insurance_coverage , which was charged before my pickup date , and unable to be reversed .
negative	i got the samples that they threw in but not the main product that i ordered !!
neutral	rubbish !
positive	so i decide to make a small purchase for about 00 . 00 dollars .
negative	my first time experience with a online website to buy tickets .
neutral	during the day , the other drivers i spoke with were great to get along with and shared there knowledge freely .
negative	my account said it was shipped 0 / 00 / 0000 0 : 00 : 00_pm pdt .

negative	it took 0 whole weeks to ship to me .
positive	everything , camera lens and such from ebay , keyboards from amazon .
negative	part did not fit
negative	i find this type of delay unacceptable , and the argument that the clipper has to be sent from illinois is completely irrelevant .
positive	i bought treats and t - shirts .
neutral	this looks_like a 0nd_class website
negative	there are not enough pictures of parts and no one could help me on the telephone helpline .
neutral	i asked why that wasn_'_t indicated on the receipt and was told it '_s automatically done ( whatever that means ) and that pureformulas is no_longer able to get the product .
negative	they lie in order to book rooms , was promised a $_00 dollar credit on one occasion and was lied to on another about hotel location and convenience .
negative	but it drops if you earn more .
negative	my order finally arrived a month after it was placed .
positive	given that this is my daily carry for work as well as leisure , i expect it to get bashed , dropped , stood on and covered in everything from paint to " unidentified organic material " ( potato peelings , beans , chicken curry etc when camping with my two little girls in the garden of a summer afternoon ) so i looked for this knife specifically .
neutral	the contact number working hours are to short for mon - fri 0 - 0 : 00 working women .
positive	very happy :)
negative	however , i checked again to find the estimated dispatch date was now the 0nd of november which is ridiculous considering i ordered the item in september !!

positive	very good quality and just beautiful .
neutral	kortet er_ikke tabt eller lignende ( det_har de så også hos komplett konstanteret efter at den_er_blevet tjekket i deres returafdeling )
negative	this statement is entirely incompatible with the absolutely pathetic , hopeless rating of 0 . 0 / 00 on trustpilot , who in their own words describe this as ' very low '.
positive	contacting squaretrade to facilitate the claim was quick and easy .
negative	putting two and two together , i imagine this may have been delivered to several people before ( hence the state of the packaging ) and they also had the sense to send it back .
positive	first time i have used this company i had a small problem with one off the yeasts that purchased and they sent me a new yeast out as a replacement very quickly all the goods came very well_packaged and will be using this company again 0st_class
negative	look at the reviews online and you will see that i '_m one of thousands of people that are sick and tired of this company .
negative	staff really rude and unprofessional .
positive	paid_extra for next_day delivery which arrived as_promised .
negative	i submitted a trouble ticket and they said i can return them but that i have to pay the return shipping .
negative	it '_s really got my hopes up and then did not complete it '_s priority as an online_retailer
negative	i even quoted their own t & cs which state that " if regrettably you find our dresses have the following issues that could not meet your requirements , you have the rights to return the dress to get a refund ."

positive	the mirror was the exact part i needed , with a very reasonable price tag and fast delivery !
negative	0 .
neutral	it did not look like what i ordered but when i went back to the serenata website , it did not show the arrangement i ordered - christmas celebration .
neutral	delivery came in only two_days .
neutral	i think the issue lies in a small customer_service team , but i don_'_t think they are out to get anyone .
neutral	i need to retain a rma_number before sending this back and that would require there website feature that does not work .
neutral	however , the website said that that location offered free truck use , if you call in advance to reserve it .
neutral	bra_priser , men vanskelig å finne tilbudene som sendes i nyhetsbrev på epost på_hjemmesiden

negative	:-)
negative	almost_impossible , actually .
positive	i ordered a tailllight for my 0000_ford five hundred .
neutral	there is no where it says that only half the trophy will be metal and the handles look poor quality .
negative	when i called they said there was nothing they could do about it and that home deliveries take 0 business days after shipping and not 0 business days like their website indicates .
negative	contacted customer_service and they said they didn_'_t know how this happened and assured us that a replacement would be shipped out asap via courier express .
negative	i emailed customer service about it but never even received a reply .
neutral	i '_m disabled so that is majorly annoying cause i can '_t pop down to the 0 - 00 when i need a card .
neutral	i phoned again as not happy with this answer spoke to some one else who said that the web_site was wrong and they would change it .
negative	not shame on you !!!
positive	supplement_warehouse is a top_notch supplement company .
positive	thanks
negative	when i went to put the item together i found the enamel was coming away on the edge of the basin where it should not be .
neutral	as usual the order process was fine , but when we got our delivery we only got 0000_litres despite ordering 0000 . tank only 0 / 0 full and no_explanation as to why we did not get the whole order . the " chit " was stuffed into the house name plate at the bottom of our drive . very unsatisfactory !
neutral	carries only a very limited selection of compression products - there are way more kinds out there .
neutral	!
negative	they wouldn_'_t even take a medical reason .
negative	i have never had a company blatantly mess up an order and then take zero responsibility for it .
neutral	this is totally_unacceptable as they never told me they were getting a prepaid reservation .

negative	however , after telling a friend about the site he was asked to provide the following :
positive	easy to use online catalog .
positive	their customer service is excellent and they always have everything i '_m looking for .
negative	when i asked the direct number to the hotel brenda provided me a number that was not toll_free so then i asked for a toll_free number and she said that they did not have one that she knew of .
negative	perhaps that might have been halved to00 and a half % 0 days_later , who_knows .
positive	but would have liked to know when more verbena was coming .
negative	wow .
negative	that was all .
neutral	if i add the cost of gas and the time it took for me to ship the core back , my alternator cost was really close to $_000 , while it is advertised for $_000 .
positive	never thought my favourite bike shop ( at_least for parts & accessories & clothing etc ) would be 0000 + miles_away !
negative	the refund process requires you to take a loss of roughly 00_% of your initial purchase price .
positive	you can now see my guide dog on me and on my left arm .
negative	then e_-_mail was received approximately 0 days_later saying it had been sent .
positive	i liked the selection that they had and i liked that it was free_shipping if you got the rims and tires together .
negative	they weren_'_t even close to the holes on the car
neutral	not sure , but the idea is good and having someone_who comes for your stuff is comfortable .
negative	i am sure it has to do with the option to use paypal , since i heard the seller only has to pay a % of the purchase goods price and not the shipping cost .
positive	i would use them again in a heartbeat !
negative	the plants were small and some of the roots were exposed .
negative	i never received a reply or call back and they made no attempt to address the issue .

neutral	pleased with items ordered , 0 sizes of paper bags , and a few reels of ribbon .
neutral	i was just disappointed to receive broken merchandise ---
neutral	delivery was pretty quick but the issue is : they zeroed out a part that was ordered as a set and still sent half the order .
neutral	after waiting for another 0 days for the remainder of my order to be delivered i sent an e_- mail to the company giving a date when the duplicate item could be collected and was informed that if collection could not be made on the arranged date i would be charged for the cost incurred of trying to make a collection , despite giving the details of a neighbour who agreed to assist in the return in case of emergencies .

positive	man , it is nice ordering parts without running all over town .
positive	i have been buying in this store since 0 . 000 when a pro_photographer recommended this to me .
neutral	the cancellations caused multiple large credit_card charges which take about a week to reverse so there wasn_'_t enough room on the card for the final booking .
neutral	i needed fed_ex to bring the food to my apartment .

neutral	come to find out it was through a third_party .

neutral	in the end , we were charged a full extra day rental , plus all of the normal fees , plus lost 00 euros . so overall we lost about $_000 that day .

positive	sales deals offer really great savings and free_shipping !
negative	i recently placed my 0nd purchase with this company and still have not received my order .
neutral	my advice would be - " be_careful what you ask for !"
negative	the first time i ordered from amiclubwear i paid for rushed shipping which was $_00 .
negative	i have no_idea if the food i ordered was delivered .
neutral	it '_s a bit of a crapshoot , but you can , by ordering from different restaurants , develop a profile of each .
neutral	unfortunatley what i asked for did not fit , so i am stuck with the part .
neutral	so delivery would be around 00 days .

neutral	we are staying in york on 00 / 00 / 0000 and i tried to book a hotel using this voucher_code but the code came up as invallid .
neutral	dont get me wrong , delivery . com is giving it a great try but i think it just needs a little more time and effort to get more customers / stores / restaurants to sign_up .
negative	produkten som_jag beställde var tydligen slutsåld .
negative	i finally used another website and got the correct part within a few_days .
negative	of course , it arrived damaged , with the left rear muffler tip totally crushed .
neutral	only issue was that my cc company saw the first attempt as a possible fraudulent charge .
neutral	luckily there were available rooms , but could have been worst if they didn_'_t .
negative	they have yet to contact me .
positive	the product '_s quality is as great as the service .

neutral	i purchased the dryer booster and planned on installing it myself .
positive	he '_s kept in touch with me even_though i only use your services one a month .
negative	but you think email '_s does it all
negative	this company is beyond poor .
negative	i received a confirmation via_e_-_mail for a hotel_room at one rate and later found out the charged my credit_card another rate that is over $_000 higher .
neutral	the email detailing the tracking of my order was confusing .
neutral	very happy with the blinds in terms of colour and mechanics but i was very careful to follow the guidelines for measuring to the letter to ensure the correct fit .
neutral	eventually worked it out by trial and error , but they were strange !
negative	another thing that i suppose is good , is that no_matter_how hard you try to trick the system and add something that was available a second ago , but not now , it will not be added to your cart , & if by chance you luck out & it is , it will still not arrive , and will show the previoius mentioned , zero item shipped for that number , and they do not tell you if you will get it , thus , why would it be listed on your invoice if they don_'_t plan on sending it ?
neutral	overall a good product but please don_'_t advertise next_day delivery if it '_s not what you provide .
neutral	hopefully , i will receive my parts tomorrow .
positive	a 0 ***** service and excellent value with a vast_range of products , backed_up by great customer service , i couldn_'_t recommend wiggle enough :-)

positive	no_surprises .
negative	for a family owned business , you should try to improve your customer_service and learn to have some respect for the people who do your business instead of making monkeys out of them .

positive	ordering the wheel_hub_assembly from partsgeek saved me about 00_%- 00_% from what the local , generic parts store would have charged and probably 000_%_off dealership prices .
neutral	i suspect the scandalous state of the industry as a whole is costing british business millions , if not billions a year - and all because of the laziness and incompetence of those we entrust with the carriage of goods .
neutral	partgeek customer service answers e_-_mail every 0 days so don_'_t expect quick response here .

negative	i parked here for 0 days and upon my return on sunday , i noticed that one of my tires was different . i have 0 continental pro tires that i recently_purchased and when i picked_up my car , one of my tires was replaced with some used piece of crap . none of the employees had any answers for me and i was told to call the manager the next_day after filling_out an incident report . i have no_idea what happened here . they either stole my tire , or somehow flattened it and tried to replace it with some crappy tire hoping i wouldn_'_t notice . i will never ever ever use this parking_lot again . on top of that , the shuttle takes_forever to pick you up from the terminal and there were three drivers in the shuttle talking_about raves and doing drugs . this place is as ghetto as they come .
positive	i will order more parts for my vehicles from partsgeek and refer them to others !

neutral	i bought two gift_cards on 0 / 00 / 00 and the order was not processed until 0 / 00 / 00 .
neutral	i started to use my newly ordered merchandise and have come to the conclusion that the company must be thinning the material that they make the hose out of because they are shredding in the heel and the leg very quickly .
neutral	when they arrived and i saw the glasses and tried them on i was very happy with the correction and the fit .
negative	i booked two rooms separately .
neutral	you got the part back
neutral	given that standard delivery is up to 00 days and most tanks have locks on them , an accurate delivery date should be notified in advance , followed_up with a reminder to ensure the customer is in ; this could be done either by telephone_call or email .
negative	0 .

positive	i have used agoda so many_times for group bookings , round the world trips and family getaways !

neutral	i was a little unsure of the process from time or ordering until delivery .
neutral	i love the site !
positive	no lie , i was a bit cautious the first time i ordered from them , and also one of the items that i ordered wasn_'_t available anymore , so they had to cancel , deducted it from my order , and since i originally had free express shipping nothing changed afterwards , its just as they say on their website .
positive	perfect .
positive	we have always rented from auto_europe as we have never found better rates .
negative	i '_m sure there '_s a plot here at play , but it doesn_'_t seem very smart : i used to buy a pack of gluten_free doves farm flour for around 0 euros , and now with the shipping_costs , it will cost me almost 0 euros - i can get it at the local supermarket for 0 , 00_euros . not really worth the bother now to go shopping at amazon uk .

negative	i '_ve done a lot of traveling for both business and pleasure and i '_ve worked with a lot of companies but if you ' re thinking about transacting business with travelocity my advice to you is don_'_t - you '_ll be better off picking_up a hand full of dirt and eating it because you '_ll enjoy that as much as dealing_with these_people and it won_'_t cost you nearly as much .

neutral	i placed a order and paid for next_day delivery but order never arrived so phoned up and it had never been despatched but they made sure it arrived the next_day but that didn_'_t help as the whole point of booking order for next_day delivery was because it was a birthday_present so they received it a day late .
neutral	because of that i placed half of my recent order with amazon .
neutral	but too much of back and forth with logo format ( in house designerns should be able to change . png file to . jpg ) as a result missed deadline .
negative	i am never buying anything from partsgeek . com again .
positive	we were recommended the electricshop . com by a family_member as being very competitive on pricing and exemplary service both before , during and after delivery .
neutral	when the order did finally get to me there were soem pieces broken because they were just thrown_into a really big box .
positive	easy to navigate website and amazingly_fast delivery .
negative	i searched the mailing contents and could not find any paperwork pertaining to the original order -
negative	when i complained to the credit_card company they twisted my words and used my attempt at being truthful ( as to not knowing when the player was damaged even_though i also mentioned that it was boxed , was never used and i was willing to take pictures of the item to prove that it had not been used / still had the protective plastic wrapper attached ).

neutral	i thought them charging me for a complete fill up upon return was not ethical seeing there was a 0 / 0 + tank left in the car .

negative	make_sure to read the fine_print if it '_s humanly possible .
positive	it felt good in the hand and when i played with it , bingo , it was fantastic !
neutral	the only word of caution i would add is that this basin was one of their cheaper ones which raises questions about the quality .
neutral	i opened another request , which was answered , telling_me to wait a bit more .
negative	that is before shipping_charges .
neutral	however , my case for iphone_0s looked much_better online , looks a little tacky in person .

neutral	however , i discovered that the process for addressing the issue described on your website is flagged with an out of service message .
negative	first -- you need to hire someone to answer the phone and then up date and correct your parts listing . this is my last order -- tired of getting the wrong and having to pay freight back when you are at fault .
neutral	however i unpacked the wine cooler to find it was badly dented and called customer_services immediately to advise them of the damage .

neutral	if you didn ’ t have a map - you were lost .

positive	the whiskey_exchange are perfect !
negative	possibly my fault but i don_'_t feel that i was advised that by booking thru_travelocity i can not earn reward_points from the hotel for my stay and also that when i tried to cancel the last day of my stay due to bad_weather , i found that i had to pay for the night regardless .
positive	the pens look and feel very good and were an_absolute bargain at the discounted price .

neutral	in the future , i will get a quote from frames_direct and then take that to my local eye store and have them match it .
neutral	too many trips to ups to pick_up parts
negative	this site had a good selection of products and the shipping_charges were reasonable .
neutral	.
neutral	i was disappointed with strips rather_than slices of smoked_salmon , but the flavour was good .

negative	" subject : expedia refund receipt
positive	i '_ve tried a range of products and they work !!
neutral	i guess i must have misread the description of the book , i '_m very disappointed .
negative	i clicked refresh a few_times more because i added more trail offers and each time the avoderm trial was there .
neutral	however a few_days_later -- but still well before the backorder date she ' d indicated -- i received notice that the original order had shipped via_usps .

neutral	i was very pleased overall with my shopping_experience and the turnaround time between placing my order and delivery to the usa was quite quick .
neutral	i love the idea of the service and the price is good - but the shipping takes a full week or more .
positive	everything is good .
neutral	but they came up with a solution of gluing the large white letters to a plain black panel .
neutral	now let '_s see if you " act upon it ".

neutral	someone_who understood what i was saying and actually acted on my disappointment .
neutral	on the good side , the beds were comfortable and warm , breakfast was tasty , the tv worked_fine and the staff were friendly .
positive	caring of your time
negative	in your infinite stupidity in trying to punish a group of people that dont care about all your little securitymeasures , because they just remove them or find a workaround , you are actually only punishing your paying customers .
neutral	i was expecting to receive my muffler very fast .
positive	with only 0_weeks left until my sister '_s bachelorette_party , i was freaking out !
negative	paid for the part never got it have sent 0 inquiries .
positive	in all three cases , the labels had to be exceptional , and they were .
neutral	so as long as every thing goes fine with your order you will be fine !
neutral	why have you started charging " sales_tax " on the final payment screen and not showing it when zip_code is entered ?
neutral	i spent most of my childhood in korea , and so am more accustomed to the asian ( especially korean ) styles presented by the website than u . s . retailers and their restrictive styles .
negative	i am normally a 00 - 00 but the 00 was too big and actually was a little on the short side .
neutral	that ' sso frustrating .
positive	though not the cheapest ( but still competitive ) shopto offer fantastic service .

positive	i will_definitely recommend the company to my friends .

neutral	i thought this was a neat gift to give but when it didnt arrive for christmas i had to get something_else for that person .

negative	i truly thought i had the deal of a life - time getting a flight from michigan to arizona at $_000 . 00 .
negative	we checked out the morning of 0 / 00 / 0000 not wanting to stay the 0th night due to service rendered .
neutral	i was exited with saving money hoping to have the full bold flavor of the nespresso coffee .
negative	the order was delivered on 0 / 0 / 00 - the box was badly_damaged with a letter from parcel_force to advise the package and contents had been damaged prior to the package been received in the uk and i would need to take this up with the sender !!
negative	still_waiting almost two_weeks for arrival of parts ordered from website .
neutral	it '_s on you to take_responsibility for it .

neutral	his cabin_filter is worth what i paid for it .
positive	delighted and wouldn_'_t hesitate to use this company again .
positive	excellence !!!!!!!!!!!!!
negative	if you are here to get me excited then you are about to get a really good story .
neutral	one was obviously not working_properly and not as bright etc so i got in touch and was asked to send back .
neutral	we all like to know what we need to do well in advance .
negative	no offer from them to send me the correct part that i actually ordered .
positive	i was highly disappointed with the service , even with all of the well - intentioned apologies and discount offers made to me .
negative	now i '_m stuck with rotors and less money in my pocket .
negative	booked a hotel on bookit . com , and 0 minutes later found a better price on the actual hotel site .
positive	this is a super company with really fast , free_shipping .
neutral	i believe avg free would work just as well and there is a free version .
neutral	i purchased the wrong part and automatically submitted a customer service ticket and they haven_'_t yet replied .
positive	one of my top go to resources for news
neutral	the boxes were identical but the parts were not .
neutral	get the feeling i got send the smaller_size although this wasn_'_t clear as the packaging didn_'_t say which size they were .
positive	i have used b_&_h many time and have always been thrilled with their service !
negative	.
positive	cannot say better_than above !
positive	i have no_idea what the people that were complaining , were complaining_about .
neutral	you can '_t beat the prices here and the shipping speed is great .
positive	def .
negative	this my third time i have written to you , to tell that you that you send me the wrong prescription_glasses .
negative	two out of the three people i spoke with were not at all empathetic and the phone frustratingly kept disconnecting .
neutral	would like a response asap .
negative	everytime i want to see my updated credit_report , they charge .
neutral	the facility is very clean .
positive	he loved it and will be visiting the plot soon .
positive	thank_you so much +++++++
positive	great value for money as well .
negative	very very very slow and when the stool and wardrobe turned_up the quality was terrible - scratched and cracked and a serious manufacturing fault !!!
positive	when discounts and points are added they are superb .
negative	?, i used another company cheeper and talked to a human within min .
negative	i complained .
positive	!
negative	and then there were silence .
negative	last_week my recent order was delivered , part of the order was wrong , i telephoned 0 seperate times waiting on hold in total over 00_mins .
positive	vad mer kan_man begära ?
negative	i have purchased similar items from other_sources for the same price which were much much larger ( 0 - 0 inches ).
neutral	sent an_email to cancel the order and never_heard from a soul !!
negative	vi gennemgår alt der_skal laves og_alt lyder flot .
neutral	hmmpf .
neutral	the booking process took several hours , very confusing and constantly having to start over .
neutral	the spoiled_rotten pet box is a good idea , but it needs to be items that aren_'_t a waste of money .
negative	i ordered a body lift , and the money was taken right_away .
neutral	the options and features and layout possibilities are really great , but it is the slowest application i have ever_seen .
neutral	it was great the first time i used it but , the second time i used it i sent two phones in two different envelopes and i heard_nothing for them in over a week .
positive	i recommend .
neutral	the price was good but to wait more than a week for a part that was in stock is just too_long to wait .
negative	i had a trip and had to make a last_minute change to the ticket .
neutral	this last time i ordered everything was accounted for just took 0 days to get here , all my orders take a bit of time to get to me .
neutral	i did so one other time and someone was trying to use my credit_card number to steal money from me by saying i was going to donate money to a fake charity , luckily the credit_card company called me to verify it .
negative	having insisted that we would not call them back and required collecting immediately , i found that my car had still not been returned .
negative	when i contacted customer_service , these thieves kept responding saying they ' re sending out a return package , which - it has_been at_least 0_weeks since my complaint and i still_haven_'_t received it yet !!!!
neutral	i book a lot of things online , products , flights , accommodation , hire cars etc as my husband and i are frequent travelers .
negative	this is one first time customer who will never order from bedworld again .
negative	i notified them that i was leaving for a motorcycle trip on june_00th so time was of the essence .
negative	i am requesting that you contact fedex and pay this bill that was sent to me .
negative	was then told if i made a minor frame change i could receive my glasses quicker .
neutral	i never got either of my free gifts or one elemis set . disappointed . hopefully it all arrives monday or i won_'_t order again .
negative	he said no one was here to receive the package
positive	my netbook had been getting slower every day until i got boostspeed .
positive	i received impeccable service and a great level of attention .
negative	i was the maid - of - honor !
positive	i '_ve been ordering from yesstyle for the past month and i have to say there predictions on shipping dates are always correct .
positive	and . bonus . it '_s possible to get free shipping to my po_box ( on items marked " free shipping ").
positive	will be my 0st choice from now on .
neutral	one of which was rejected as it did not show how the pipe did not fit into the trap !
negative	support er rystende inkompetent , man_bliver til boksebold mellem support og forhandler , ingen vil tage ansvar , ingen vil reparere , absolut ingen adgang_til tabte data .
negative	i therefore made an order and received the glasses shortly_after .
positive	highly_recommended .
neutral	the second room was listed as 0_adults ; therefore filled out our info .
positive	i needed refrigerated probiotics and despite the fact that it was expensive , the order arrived the next_day and the freeze pack was still frozen !
positive	best rates , no_hassle , no_problems , and it puts me at ease knowing travelocity does all of the work !
neutral	as others have stated over and over again , wix is buggy as hell .
negative	well to my surprise i had to pay 00 dollars to send the part back , this is the part i didn " t order .
neutral	i would probably try another site for booking travel the next time i do so .
negative	monday_morning i tried yet again .
neutral	this would increase accuracy .
neutral	i was not as impressed as i thought i would be .
negative	there seems to be many more buses of the original bus_tour company .
neutral	they said it could take as much as 00 days to get my core money sent to me .
neutral	suggestions : it would be nice to receive an_email the day the product is shipped .
negative	i went with the 00 and as i have stated then had to pay to have my dress altered .
neutral	what really irked me is that i needed an extra hdmi_cable , i ordered one and it never told me it was out of stock .
negative	parts geak return center is back on the east_coast but was ship to from california the shipping to the return address for the 0 rotor cost $_00 . 00 each $_000 . 00 for both ups_ground watch out for ther packing sucks and your responsible for the item packing be returned in resale condition i would attach a photo but i can '_t never do_business with this company
positive	i would suggest that for regular customers like me do whatever they could to increase daily and monthly limits purchase ukash
positive	customer_service was also nice and accommodating .
positive	keep_up the good work !
negative	problemer_med flyene gang på gang og dårlig behandling af kunderne .
neutral	product and price fine - but 0_weeks to deliver longer_than_expected !
positive	correspondence and delivery very good . nothing_negative to say at all .
positive	thanks so much for a wonderful gift !
negative	since i fly sw , i am accustomed to being_able to change my dates for a relatively painless fee of ~ 00 or less .
negative	i entered a trip , entered the promo_code , which it showed the deduction , then saved it before booking .
negative	ekspedienten som tog imod min bestilling , passerer mig 0 gange med varer_til_andre kunder som kom ind efter mig .
positive	they arrived beautifully_packaged and labelled and i am very pleased with my purchase .
neutral	and in addition it did not arrive with any personalized picture on it .
positive	arrived very quickly and in great shape
negative	they keep falling_off " i sent a further letter to say i was disgusted that they are selling leather that '_s not fit for purpose and that the leather was inferior as it is made in china .
neutral	two double_beds plus a pull out sofa , mini_fridge , microwave & coffee_maker .
neutral	he said no right off the bat and didn_'_t even discuss with me about working a deal .
neutral	yes , i was able to google it and find it myself and do the hard work myself , but i honestly believed that for almost $_000 / year i should be getting more than just a credit_monitoring service with the ability to see my credit_score , which in essence is what i get .
neutral	cost of postage and packing was over the top .
negative	i '_ve emailed the " call me " section with my request to cancel my order and be refunded the $_000 . 00 that has_been taken out of my account .
neutral	after sending , held up by hong_kong post for four days .
positive	lyndon loaded an advance copy of his detoolkit which is a big help in doing normal maintenance tasks .
negative	i ordered floor_mats for a 0000_audi tt .
positive	hey go to parts_geek . com they even had parts for older_cars .
negative	i never received it .
neutral	the usual online ticket experience until my credit_card was rejected due to billing_address not matching card .
negative	very bad customer_service .
positive	it is just perfect !
neutral	price match offer i found misleading .
negative	i tried to track the book and i got a message_saying that it has_been shipped but does not yet have a tracking_number ??
positive	brilliant .
neutral	everything came in as told and how they showed on line .
negative	the box i got was torn to shreds and had ton of clear tape holding the fragments together .
positive	thanks for making it easy .
negative	they didn_’ t have a clue .
neutral	the only other option would be to call the head_office in usa .
neutral	this was my first experience .
negative	how am i suppose to return an item and get my money back when you get even get a person to talk to ?
negative	es wurde bejat , meldet sich ebookers nicht .
negative	i am interested to hear from others who have had similar problems to understand how wide spread the problem is and to determine what can be done .
neutral	i clicked on free delivery and was not aware it was second class postage .
neutral	my car was not waiting fro me even_though i spoke to the same person twice while waiting for my luggage .
negative	however , they told me there was nothing they could do .
positive	we are very pleased with our squaretrade experience .
positive	first time i purchased from the site and was very pleased with the fantastic service !
positive	my company email address apparently blocked it .
negative	he checked , and sure enough , needed the info again since it had been so long .
negative	the swimsuit was not used .
neutral	tested also a bill only in water and it gave effect to the use of cocaine , amphetamines and pcp !
negative	your shipping department should have noticed they took to long and upped the shipping type to 0nd or something quicker because of there mistake .
negative	when it arrived it had no packaging on it at all .
neutral	i even tried to order crews and could not get through on the phone .
positive	i would recommend to anyone and will be a repeat_customer .
positive	enough said really , delivery was as stated and item arrived in perfect_condition at a price 00_% less_than retail .
negative	will never use this company again .
positive	i had ordered letting that was waaay to big for my project and the fixed it and shipped it no charge .
negative	willing to pay extra for postage so they can . make some money .
positive	afternoon etc .
negative	the responce was making and the wrong part
neutral	plus , it '_s like the netflix recommendations -- after awhile , everything gets watered_down to 0_stars and its impossible to find any standout places to eat .
positive	not only because they have everything i need in a clear and easy to decipher website , but because they are a shining_example of a company that exercises their american right of freedom of religion .
positive	have never had an_issue with any order i '_ve place , and i order about once a month .
negative	good thing i read the cancellation_policy if not he wouldve gotten away with that one .
positive	i have only found the greatest people and energy , and felt right at home in every place i stayed in .
negative	she was rude and could care less about the situation .
neutral	parts are easy to find but correcting a mistake was impossible . there was no way to be sure that an order had been placed untill the next_day . returns only after your order has_been recei , thenyou may request an authorization_number to return the item which i received after about 00_hours . very cumbersome , it would have been nice to correct my mistake by phone or e_mail . paying the shipping_charges both_ways was a painful experience .
positive	he arrived in one of the options i had to pick from a hyundai elantra 00 and brought me to the lot .
neutral	booking with travelocity is easy , and convenient .
positive	you feel badly when you eat junk and so does your pet !
positive	i will_defiantly check here 0stin future .
positive	big regards to heinnie_haynes team
neutral	given the choice of when to ship , i picked " next week ".
positive	!
negative	travelocity advisor should have known that it was cheaper to book new flights than to change existing flights ( then again maybe he did know that , i assume the are paid a percentage of what they can con you in to paying )
negative	then my package turned_up and money taken from my card !
negative	a complete_waste of my time .
neutral	the attraction is a small minimum purchase , set at $_00 , needed for free_shipping .
positive	i bought some schwalbe nobby nics , merlin are always very competitive on price .
negative	oh wait , that did not work , that hotel is unavailable .
negative	when i placed the order for my car struts i accidently typed in the wrong zip_code , for four days i was calling that customer service line you have , each time i waited for 00_minutes , 00_minutes !!!
neutral	i '_m a little disappointed that i have no other avenue to get an_rma from them till they ' re ready to send me one via_email .
neutral	the problems are so many that i don_'_t have the desire to continue buying from you
neutral	and it was nice not having to go find my car .
negative	ended_up making them myself .
neutral	he put it back in yesterday , but we were dissapointed with the service , hated the constant smell of kerosene and fear there may be a health risk .
positive	i fail to understand_why everyone doesn_'_t use quidco , it '_s a no_brainer .
neutral	seems like a trap to keep your money .
positive	they have a great range of products that is much_cheaper_than anywhere_else !!
neutral	he even put me on hold to find out .
neutral	overall , i '_m satisfied that i have a working door_handle again .
negative	!
negative	i have sold two items to people in which later they decide they no_longer want .
neutral	need a warm a fuzzy feeling to order again .
negative	i have stupidly tried twice to do_business and would have to be totally ignorant to do it again since not a single time has anyone done anything to help resolve my problem and i have spent $_00 shipping on defective parts
positive	i need a lcd_screen for my dell inspiron at a reasonable price and that would work quickly screen_country provided that service for me .
negative	ordered an item , paid_extra for named day delivery , did not arrive on that day , after many phone_calls promised to deliver the following week , did not arrive , eventually turned_up two and a half weeks after ordering , sent complaint via_email , only received an_automated reply , sent second email did not receive anything .
neutral	that '_s a week .
negative	i was told i would be transferred to the finance department but got cut_off again .
neutral	another great thing your competitor does is have someone come out to the car with you to go over the basics and do a once over to ensure everything as it is stated on the sheet .
negative	then , if they have not answered your trouble call , they will not let you try to write them again because you can only have one open trouble call .
neutral	you should help people more when their vouch ours don_'_t work or are running_out , i have missed several deals and lost money because of this .
positive	the picture and the description were accurate .
positive	after my dad took a fall in the shower , we weren_'_t sure what we needed to do in order to make_sure it didn_'_t happen again .
neutral	however , the last two times i bought from them , i have had issues .
positive	items came very quickly - within 0 days of order .
neutral	hi .
positive	lots to offer on their website - easy to order - received quickly - daughter loved it !
negative	the reviews that i read about the place should have been written by the hotel staff themselves !
negative	total lie !
positive	specs without the hassle !
neutral	ordering was fairly easy and so was the secure_payment process .
neutral	i bought a set of corner glass shelves here because the prices were very good compared to similar products from other manufacturers / stores .
positive	i love the way they will remind you of special_occasions .
positive	i was delighted to see petflow carried it , along with evangers organic which is a better price than i was paying at the natural pet_store here in town .
neutral	still_waiting for delivery for the replacements .
positive	this is one of the most transparent companies i '_ve ever given my money to and they never_disappoint .
negative	the days inn near riverwalk / downtown area is far from a 0_star and bookit should be ashamed of themselves for deceiving customers .
positive	i have also been very happy with the quality of parts received .
neutral	we had been given a renault clio .
neutral	i wonder when i '_ll be getting the gift_card ?
positive	but , i have had problems with finding it and pet_flow is the 0rd company i '_ve used .
neutral	on the confirmation and payment page ,.
negative	you said no discount - you lie , hampton takes aarp
positive	after i made a mistake they ensured that my trophy arrived before the deadline with no_fuss at all .
negative	when i came back , still really slow .
positive	i will never go back , expedia is my go to for all my travel needs , business or personal !
negative	we organized some time to stay at a place in sidney recently .
neutral	to summarise - don_'_t feel_confident , all jargon , so remote , stressful .
negative	then u pay restocking_fee .
negative	also a side_note , the package shipped from the same city i live in , yet i need to ship it back to new_jersey .
negative	jeg afbryder ekspedienten og spørger ham hvorfor han tager den kunden istedet ?
positive	overal a very good experience therefore i would use this site / company again .
positive	advice was helpful and the delivery was speedy - it turned_up at the time and day they said it would .
neutral	this limits what the company can do for returns ( one must pay for shipping items back , fill_out custom form , which is time_consuming and expensive b /_c items must ship internationally ).
neutral	the shipping initially came up as $ 0 . 00 which made sense to me because they were all being shipped to the same address , but when i went to check out it had jumped to $ 0 . 00 .
positive	he stayed on the line while i did the task i needed and verified the problem was solved .
positive	!
positive	gret service
neutral	so they dropped it to $_00 .
negative	these_people track your ip_address and try to steal information from your computer . they are tied in with hackers . they say it is free but they are trying to get info from you .
positive	i looking_forward to my vac to see if i made the right choice but so_far i think i did !!!!!
positive	congratulations guys , keep it up !
neutral	instead of having reasonably square corners they were rounded which looks naff .
neutral	to order just one part took me almost 0 hours to put the order through .
neutral	finally a month or so later , i called the local district_manager , and explained the situation .
negative	" we do not offer reshipment because we would yet again incur 0nd shipping cost thus us paying more on the order than required .
neutral	it was a week .
positive	i then sent my frames in the prepaid box to lens factory .
positive	on the site itself , it would be nice to have better descriptions , because for any given part there are many manufacturers and it is hard to tell the difference other than price .
positive	great job . tnx !

neutral	the order arrived very quickly and is on good quality card

neutral	if time were on my side , i ' d return the goods - sadly this is not the case , so we '_ll just have to work with what we have .
neutral	paid a pretty high ($_00 ) fee to them also .
negative	that would be called having compassion and good customer_service and from many reviews that seems to be something you don_'_t have .
neutral	unfortunately the fitter was not quite as quick to use his telephone to tell me that he wouldn_'_t be there by 0pm .
positive	repeat_customers are evidence of satisfaction , we '_ve used your services on different continents and have been unfailingly satisfied .

positive	the ' stoves ' induction_hob cooker is excellent , but like the belling , it is not 000 mm as_advertised .
neutral	however may i suggest you look carefully at the size before you order .
neutral	i thought the skin i was buying would cover pretty_much all of my samsung_galaxy but when it came it covers the front around the screen well but just the middle of the back .

negative	have finally fitted a squiffy , nasty mess to my new bathroom because i cannot_afford to pay the plumber again and better_bathrooms won_'_t consider a refund .
negative	keep in mind , they advertise a 00 day return / 0day exchange policy .

positive	i am a fan of the easyclip brand and i have been using them for years .
positive	it '_s all you advertised it to be .
positive	i recommend global_airport_parking because they are the best .
positive	discount is immediate .
negative	it broke my heart to see her suffer through this inaccuracey of sizing .
neutral	had the understanding that if i called a representative i could get a 0 %_discount , not a big discount but a good amount on a big trip , was offered $_00 discount .
negative	i understand that 000 years_ago this would have taken much longer if even possible but in the competitive market today this is business suicide .
negative	despite purchasing in good time the ticket still hadn_'_t arrived yesterday , i called viagogo and was told they would look into into and call me back .
neutral	jeg_kan bedst lide at få tingene afgjort med_det samme og direkte kommunikation , derfor vil jeg i en sådan situation foretrække telefonsamtale frem for mail og sms .
negative	will not be ordering from them in the future , as an_email from them indicating an issue with me order would have eased my concerns .
positive	perfect .
positive	i have ordered stuff from heinnie_haynes for years they are very reliable with fast delivery and excellent communication_regarding orders .
neutral	when checking online the status never changed .
positive	delivery is very fast and all items are packaged excellently .
neutral	,
neutral	however , none of the packs seemed to be compromised .
neutral	the problem i have with this is being forced to call instead of being_able to list my reason for cancellation on the site itself .
positive	car part_kings saved me money , had good helpful salesmen , and the part was right .
positive	precision_tax relief has excellent service and reasonable cost .
neutral	if this was an electronic part it would have been damaged .
negative	they booked us in a hotel were children under 00 years are not accepted .
negative	i even got told i could no_longer email them as they was blocking my address .
neutral	chulve .
negative	as a real_estate company , we buy a lot of building products , never have i been treated in such an unprofessional manner .
positive	our company will certainly be using them again .
neutral	the shuttle was there and got us to our flight in about 00 min .
positive	only problem was he was expecting some parts and opened the package and saw his_birthday_present !
positive	the trackday was full but this did not show itself on track with plenty of space for everyone and i did not see any_issues on the day .
neutral	to my pleasant surprised , i got something akin to the following :
neutral	the delay in delivery causes many still do not buy the healthdesigns because competitors have 00 calendar days in delivering certain .
positive	and , my order will ship again as i '_ve indicated so no need to worry_about running_out of food !
neutral	the service was hassle_free .
positive	we have had the same driver each time from palletways and each time he has_been courteous and pleasant and on time .
neutral	i had difficulties with ordering my hotel_room .
neutral	too_long !
negative	definitely use with caution .
positive	skyparksecure is much_better value than other airport_parking sites .
negative	if someone buys something , then that item then belongs to them .
negative	after being told to basically deal with it . my credit_card is being refunded ( so they say , i will check this daily ) and i am left without the product i ordered a month_ago !!!
positive	i ordered 00 medals complete with club logo .
neutral	i would think_twice before using parts_geek again .
negative	i immediately went to partsgeek website to find a phone_number to report i had a problem .
negative	wanted 0 items sent to different_addresses and both went to one no_explanation
positive	we had zero_problems !
negative	so after cramming 0 of us in a taxi , with a not so good driver , we got to the airport , to find out we had missed our connection .
neutral	i was then told that all supervisors were busy helping other people and that it had been a " crazy day ".
neutral	sat for half an_hour then rang again as it was our fault we were early but it was now out booked time .
neutral	poor customer_service also cost if returning items won_'_t use again will stick to debenhams
positive	great website and quick service .
neutral	just had a really hard time catching one at any stop we made .
positive	excellent service .
positive	very good first time buying experience from merlin_cycles .
neutral	upon_receipt of our design work , staff were quick with advice and the order arrived much_quicker_than we ' d anticipated .
positive	would definitely recommend this company to others but . exact confirmation of what is required between both the customer and the company is essential , so as not to lead to any_problems .
positive	great job , comsumer - rankings !
positive	you gotta get one for your gopro or dash cam .
negative	thank_you .
negative	lovely products at fantastic prices , can not believe the poor level off customer_service i received because of this i would prefer to spend my money eles where in future
positive	perfectly done and gift recipient was very happy . nice job .
positive	i '_ve purchased from b_&_h for years and would recommend them to every and any one .
positive	great products , easy to use the site , quick delivery , high_quality , beautiful designs so even someone without a creative aptitude can create beautiful labels and more !
positive	parts were very high_quality , fit the first time with no_issues .
neutral	for that i had to go to the airline web_site -- but that raises the question , why_bother with travelocity in the first place , instead of going direct to the carrier ?
negative	the 0000 number on the billing information will not let you talk with someone and then it says goto our website but gives no website address !
negative	i am in school and do not need information on another school just the scholarships and grants that you offered .
negative	the customer_service lady , again blamed me for this mistake and said that i was actually supposed to peel the small stickers off and place them on the bottles .
positive	really pleased with it and would recommend it to any friends wanting an ipad_cover .
negative	in response i was told that it must be disabled for them to activate it , now as you may know it takes no_longer_than 0 minute to type in the steam guard code but after explaining this too him he had no valid reason_why it was not possible with steam guard activated !, i then told them that i am taking this into paypals hands and reporting a hack attempt of my steam account , it was no suprise that they did not want this and lets just say they responded with some speed !
negative	i called on october 00 , 0000 to get the status of the claim .
neutral	if they had customer product reviews maybe i would '_ve found out from other customers that i needed to order half a size up .
positive	yesstyle . com give you so many_choices to shop from .
neutral	took nearly a week to sort out , not sure if the final delivery was the ones that were originally sent or a new pair .
negative	all in all , this was a horrendous experience that i do not intend to repeat .
positive	i live 0 , 000_miles from its shipping point and the first time i ordered , i had it the next_day .
negative	i spent 00_min .
neutral	i then called echo and before they would checking the details of my order , they were trying to suggest the problem was at my end , that i either hadn_'_t placed the order properly and when i explained i ordered through paypal and had a paypal receipt they were saying it might be that my address is not confirmed ( which it is ), only after debunking the excuses did they then look up .
positive	i '_ve looked all over for different parts for my 0000_jeep .
positive	great service , prices , and customer service .
neutral	have tried many_times to get_ahold of some one but with no response your parts looked very good but it would not work .
neutral	so i am not 000_% sold on the idea that i got a good deal , because other_places like vitacost or gnc will ship here for a very low_cost or even free .
negative	their explanation was that the insurers might be charging the same for one month as for multiple month periods , so we ' re forced to pay up or not have coverage .
neutral	the time it took for me to receive my repaired frames took much longer_than advertised .
negative	you might not get what you pay for !
negative	a bill of lading from the manufacturers could clarify .
positive	it went through but then a few_days_later we received an_email that the order was delayed and was a pre_- order scared of the worst i went on to the live_chat the new_york company offers 00_hours a day 0 days a week and they put my mind at ease by explaining the dress they where shipping had been damaged some how and they had to get another but she assured_me that it would be mailed express at no charge to me .
neutral	i had to be on that flight as my daughter had just booked it and we are going together .
negative	as a member of the netherbury gardening club i would be reluctant to order form you again .
neutral	a lil disappointed because the way itis advertised it seems like you get alot .
negative	this caused me to miss my flight and customer service including a supervisor told me i was our of luck and would not help me rebook .
neutral	seriously .!
negative	it '_s now eight days from order and it hasn_'_t even shipped .
neutral	then i am given a different bunch of flowers nothing like i ordered and told extra flowers had been added which is the upgrade , for all o know that bunch has the original value of my order .
negative	there is little reason for your aggressive attitude .
neutral	i have just begun the process .
neutral	the man_who helped_us at the hertz office in edinburgh was rude and sarcastic .
positive	the products were securely_packed and saved $$$ with free shipping and various promotions .
neutral	fitter_turned_up for appointment as planned & appeared to do a really good job . until .
negative	katherine kitch
positive	it is full of great information and lenders that can help you get out of a sticky situation .
positive	all best ,
positive	some claimed they got the wrong part , others claim no service my e_-_mail , i did not experience these problems , not only did i get the right part , and in about a week , but i had a concern and a question , and parts_geek folks responded to my e_-_mail the very next_day .

neutral	still_waiting
neutral	only had one shake so_far ; the packaging is great , the mixer is good , the butterscotch flavour needs a bit more taste though !
negative	cant_wait for my contract to end . nothing but problems worst customer service ever . have had poor connection problems for 0 months finally they sent an engineer not qualified to fix fibreoptic
neutral	i received great service and all my needs were satisfied .
positive	i can '_t wait to look at all my free_samples !
neutral	could it be that mr . murphy ( of the famous murphy '_s law ) has given me a lemon printer and a lemon cartridge ?
neutral	it '_ll do for now , but i wish i would have had more information on it .
positive	i have bought from parts
negative	looks_like more chinese_junk .
neutral	maintenance person wanted to jump the car .
neutral	bought a phone via amazon - all good .
positive	delivery has also be a forte with partgeek . com .
neutral	it '_s also a bit_slower_than one of the top - rated antivirus programs .
neutral	not being sure it was used , i went_ahead and installed it since i needed to get my car smog tested .
negative	!
negative	despite confirmation of delivery at 0 :_00pm , orders to not leave with neighbors and calling the recipient to look for them as soon as i recieved the delivery text .
positive	what else can a customer expect
negative	i asked flight_centre to help me with a return flight from uk to johannesburg because i wanted to keep the return open for some months .
positive	i '_ve only had good experiences with b_&_h . they have the best prices .
neutral	good site , easy to shop , very slow shipping .
neutral	despite the fact that , according to your information , prices on the website include the service at night , the company eurocar took an extra_cost of 00 euros .
positive	so yeah , i ordered the new board around mid - day , chose the 0 - 0 days option and it arrived the very next_morning .
neutral	little disappointed with mine , as friends said this was one of the main good ideas for
positive	that is the only_drawback by ordering on line is the lack of personal fit .
neutral	however , when i arrived at the motel , their was no confirmation there .
neutral	i finally ended_up calling the airlines and paying extra to get assigned seats on both flights .
positive	i booked a collection from my home on a saturday and it was collected by parcel_hero on the monday and arrived across the other side of the world by the thursday .
neutral	i arrived there at 00 :_00pm & didn_'_t leave with my vehicle until 0 :_00pm .
negative	no towels .
negative	poor service is not something that is generally sought .
positive	really impressed with tahoe mtn sports - my order was shipped mere hours after i ordered it .
neutral	also showing the stars for the guests would provide an incentive for every guest to behave and would save a lot of money for airbnb shareholders by decreasing the amount of time dealing_with guests hosts disputes .
negative	i never received any confirmation from either spirit or this company that the booking went through !
neutral	a 00 sensor and it cost 0 dollars ground ??????
neutral	it
negative	i called travelocity back and spoke with justin and was told that i had already spoke with someone earlier twho told me this was non_- refundable .
positive	every person i came in contact with was courteous and helpful and i had a great experience .
neutral	each time you took_care of problem , but these problems shouldn_'_t happoen in the first place .
neutral	i am_currently trying to contact them to get this issue_resolved .
neutral	my new puppy is a joy !
negative	the lights worked initially . but when i tried to put them up they flickered and half of them went dark .
neutral	on the downside , the billing_address to use the cards was the purchasers address , when it should have been the recipient '_s .
neutral	nothing has taken place yet .
neutral	had the prices been cheaper it would be worth it to continuenhaving it delivered by pewfflow regularly , but i think i am going to cancel my standing order .
negative	i was at the point of either hanging up or asking for a supervisor .
neutral	construction quality is more rugged than zenni .
neutral	i asked my flight attendant if he could_possibly find me another seat and explained to him that i had been up for over 00_hours and he just said it was a crowed flight today and just walked away !
positive	!
neutral	cumbersome process if something_goes_wrong with order and i ' d rather pay more elsewhere and get better service .
negative	then i leave a bad review on this website and they responded to my review saying it wasn_'_t their problem basically .
negative	the blue /
positive	but this experience with powermax was nothing but easy going and professional .
positive	the international delivery was prompt and the product was just what i expected .
negative	there was no delivery notice .
neutral	the 0 lengths of tile edging i ordered came in a clear plastic_wrapping , which served as no protection_against damage . both the items were damaged . i . e various dents along the lengths , which are quite difficult to straighten . as these items were of a fairly soft material , i was surprised that they were not packed in a cardboard_tube
neutral	not acceptable on a weekday .
neutral	resorted in messaging the boohoo facebook_page and was suprised at how helpful the 0 people i spoke to were .
negative	ok this might take some time ,
neutral	i know this can be dangerous , but i cannot_afford to throw_away this much food .
negative	finally was able to create a ticket and after more than 0_weeks i now have an_email_stating my money was refunded .
neutral	what the heck ?
neutral	this unit , and purchase a lock ( not leave a deposit for a lock ) that i will have no

neutral	the latest screen has a full on down by the clock in the bottom right corner the previous screen to that was the incorrect one for the model .
positive	we do use stress_free parking quite alot and just within the last month we have used them 0 times .
negative	but now i am waiting for my credit to my account .
negative	so i went to adjustment them by the adjustment and it was broken .
negative	bad_reviews against cj '_s are removed and after 0 days mine has not been reinstated so read from that what you will .
neutral	other than that , i ' d probably order from them again
positive	wowcher is the best thing since_sliced bread !!
negative	also , that it would take 0 - 0 business days to refund my money .
neutral	i had no_problems with the online experience , only with the shipping .
negative	for the money ?
neutral	maybe the picture made it seem bigger .
negative	herudover er_det dårligt , at man ved fejlstørrelse ikke kan returnere i butikkerne igen ( det_kan_man når_man køber på magasins webside ) så_man har store omkostninger når_man_skal sende tilbage .
positive	great customer_service and very useful .
neutral	although , i find ordering on line makes it difficult to know what it is .
positive	i saved over $_000 by using this website !
negative	it wasn_'_t as if it was really cheap either .
positive	it '_s quite remarkable really , but the item was ordered at a weekend and delivered on a tuesday .
positive	i was apprehensive at first ordering my dell ink_cartridges from a company other than dell .
positive	i tried something new and will have to reorder another food my dog likes .
positive	my only_complaint : i opted for the basic belt buckle .
negative	when we arrived , we were given a room with a view of the parking_lot and mcdonald '_s .
neutral	my reason for using automated recurring internet shipments is because i don_'_t have time to check up on and micro manage these things .
negative	one extremely unhappy customer .
neutral	the problem stated the first night after checking into america best value inn dayton , ohio .
neutral	not sure if i would buy again .
negative	in middle of dealing_with a dispute between your company and park n fly .
neutral	england . given big vauxall deisel gusler . ran_out of standard cars . will not accept again that was national
negative	it was going to cost me $_00 . 00 to send back a crappy part that cost $_00 . 00 plus 00_%_off to " restock " the item .
negative	sent money to a villa owner . and its been a week and his bank hasn_'_t recieved the cash .
neutral	they were able to see my booking confirmation .
positive	hello ,
neutral	i am still trying to get the overcharge refunded .
positive	it feels safe , secure and the loading time of the games is fast , no waiting around for anything to load .
neutral	however , lately , prices have not been as competitive as far as buying their books goes ; they have been on the pricier side and i therefore have had to turn to other_sources to buy my books .
positive	they have an awesome inventory , with great prices ad fast shipping !
neutral	i was very satisfied with the delivery time , it came the next_day . the price was also good . the only problem was that i was sent the wrong flavour extend .
positive	i got exactly_what i ordered and it was a perfect_fit .
positive	recieved my package in less_than 00 hour of making the order .
negative	highly avoid .
positive	i would use them again .
neutral	were fine and of good relative value compared to the oem counterpart .
neutral	booking process was fine , they just need pick_up their act !
neutral	now that we have the furniture , we are pleased with the result .
negative	i put them on my dog and all he has to do is walk and the lights shuts off .
neutral	fuel_tank was less_than half and not noticed so i ate most of the cost ( 00 euro ).
negative	i waited a few_days and they still havent emailed me .
positive	to find quality food at a sale price because i am on autoship is sooo nice , she deserves the best i can feed her , but my budget is always tight .
neutral	i have really no_complaints about the quality since i understand that we always get what we pay for .
positive	just recieved a cushion and i am very pleased .
negative	so i sent trustpilot the packing_slip which they said was not enough .
negative	worst i have every experience .
neutral	it '_s just a pity it took so long for them to try and appease a customer who will more than likely purchase again from the internet but who will probably use another company who is more customer friendly .
neutral	i did not have the time to make the trip .
neutral	the website is easy to navigate , but the communication as to whether your goods have been dispatched or not is non_- existent .
negative	it came up with a message " the gift_card or prepaid card you entered has already been redeemed ".
negative	i was never notified by travelocity that this would happen , or that it did happen .
positive	!
negative	it was a $_00 . 00 card .
negative	problem is , they shipped the part in the original parts box !!
negative	!
positive	my vet recommend c . e . t .
positive	the best remittance service so_far .
neutral	they state in their policy no refunds or returns .
neutral	might want to look into a upgrade !!!
positive	god , hurtig_og effektiv betjening :)
positive	i have ordered from here many_times and it has not dissatisfied me once , really love the site !
neutral	after someone fixed it , the person messed_up my itinerary by removing the trip protection from my itinerary then i have to called back again but they could not fix .
positive	what more could i have wanted ?
neutral	i '_m not sure the cost makes up for the inconvenience .
positive	thanks for creating this .
neutral	maybe there '_s a disconnect somewhere ?
neutral	i told them to put my tire back on my car .
negative	and it took over a week to get the wrong part .
positive	add i can add toys and treats as needed .
negative	in the end .
positive	have not used part yet due to the fact that i still another part i will be ordering very soon .
neutral	hoping that the repair service was handled better this time and there will be no follow_up issue .
neutral	the bunching on the inlet pipes make it extremely difficult to connect the fittings .
negative	if true , it '_s the worst business management i '_ve come_across .
negative	not only that , their size small ( and i '_m a size small ) is too big for me .
negative	after ordering my e_- one i have been given 0 differnent dates for delivery .
neutral	sometimes they make an_error , but heaven forbid you call them and ask them to correct it .
negative	well , while the information here may be strictly speaking correct , you have very cleverly avoided the effects .
positive	but , every time , awesomebooks keeps on delivering in time and in great condition .
positive	i get it , they are in sales and want you to buy a car but i had a 0000 car with low_mileage , so i didn_'_t need a new car but they still took the time to answer all my questions .
positive	i will do this again .
positive	i ordered a watch on a sunday nite via my mobile . it said 0 / 0 days and living in northern_ireland i expected 0 days . tuesday_morning package arrives !!!
neutral	that '_s pretty unusual in 0000 and would stop me from trying to juggle anything even relatively time sensitive from this company .
negative	i called to inquire_about a refund but i was told that i will not be issued any .
negative	went to a hotel website and thought i had called the hotel reservation line for the hotel .
neutral	sorry adequate but could do better !
negative	i dragged the cot ' mattress ', if you can call it that , on the floor , and that is where i slept .
positive	really we thought they had given us the wrong car lot number , so i said ," see if the key opens the car " and and so we drove_off in the brand_new mercedes 000 .
positive	they always have the part i need , at the best price and from the best manufacturers .
negative	!
neutral	i would not look if the prices were better .
negative	i was happy with the pictures of the dress as compared to what i got .
negative	we requested that they contact the hotel to see if we could extend our stay a night and for assistance in getting flights rescheduled and extending our stay .
neutral	then you couldn_'_t track my order .
positive	great transaction !!
neutral	my dogs love the chicken treats .
negative	received a part that was clearly defective .
negative	( which is included on the us_airways website ).
neutral	i got the cheapest cable so there is not much in the way of good channels and to soon to see about internet at this point .
negative	so i had to rebook for 0 days_later and they charged me half price .
positive	i have been a loyal beliver for years but parts_geek had a better price tried it and was impressedmuch better site and ordering .
positive	it was a wintery day brrr ! but thats london 0u matter of fact england .
negative	i do understand that mistakes and crazy things_happen .
neutral	i '_m still missing a converter extension plug for the power chaise .
negative	i will never iuse partsgeek again .
positive	i have used stressfree_parking several_times and find it well run , convenient and well_worth the money - i will use it every time i travel overseas .
neutral	if the website worked better to secure i booking it would have made planning a vacation much_easier !
positive	i would highly_recommend this service !
negative	just how long does a person have to wait to have the money returned to them ?
neutral	fortunately i had output with a confirmation number on it .
neutral	this leads me to believe that the reason it took so long was shoddy packaging at the source .
neutral	not sure of service .
negative	but i don_'_t want to feel_like rushed into paying a car note !!
negative	well , guess what . they made nothing right !
negative	we contracted with totally driven for transport from our london hotel in kensington to harwich in order to board our cruise ship .
neutral	in previous times the opposite has happened and taken full 00 days when i needed it before . there must be a way of sorting that out !
positive	when i need oils again i will order from you , and i will recommend you to my friends .
neutral	not impressed , having spent some time doing price comparison , to discover a hidden booking fee charge .
neutral	but the report that the site is trustworthy and even taking the product reach will_continue buying and recommending .
negative	i was going to order parts for a dodge pick_up but now have reconcidered do to customer service .
negative	a couple days_later i get a rma_number to return .
neutral	the frozen food was starting to thaw by the time i drove to fed_ex to pick it up .
neutral	this is my last order with them -- using up credit -- until they start doing distribution for american customers from america , not hong_kong .
neutral	to move the old machine meant bending down a long way ( for us ) to lift a great weight .
negative	?
neutral	we were pleased to find nespresso_capsules for a lower price and placed an order right_away .
negative	never ever use the geek tech toolbox
neutral	why do the deliveries have to start so early ?
neutral	perfect view from the hostel , nice staff , booked 0 bed_dorm , got a 0 bed one .
positive	it was exactly like the org .
negative	we booked for 0 nights , thursday thru sunday , and we had to leave one day early , due to an_emergency back home .
neutral	or at_least give you the option to opt_out .
positive	will not buy such items again from a chemist as prices on this site are so reasonable .
neutral	nothing more to add
negative	the support_team is super slow , took me 00 days for a response
positive	immediate and updated order and shipping info , with final notification of a one hour delivery slot , with an option to change if necessary .
negative	i expect the money to be in my account by 00 days or i will take legal_action .
negative	i have had to resort to getting the proof of delivery from parcel_force .
positive	), then a follow_up email a week_later asking my thoughts - which i '_m happy to share .
neutral	it looked fine , but when i received my ship confirmation the next_day , only the first address line was included .
neutral	i did object also to be charged 00 . 00_euros out of hours charge at the airport - when we started the collection before the late charge supplement .
negative	wrong_address was put on package and instead of correcting it with ups they chose to have parts returned .
negative	we called and another is on the way .
negative	i have been unable to remove the marks but as i had experienced so much hassle i simply couldn_'_t be bothered asking for another and having more trouble and damage and more sleepless_nights .
negative	therefore these are not the boxes that they came in from monroe !
positive	definitely recommend that you check it out !
negative	i have ordered from ilumi in the past and have been very happy with the food .
positive	i intend to buy my supplements from them exclusively in future .
negative	they never arrived and no - one contacted me to say there was a problem with the delivery .
positive	i couldn_'_t remember my login info at first , and their nice reps helped out with that and just several days_later i had the money from my claim .
negative	very disappointed in customer_service .
negative	this is suppose to be some protection for a full year but i don_'_t see where you are protecting anything at all . to be protected you have to pay for everything but yet i feel suckered , once again , into giving my personal information plus my credit_card info . i would like you to close my account here at identity_guard and not one dime had better be charged to my card .
neutral	excellent service to the easy places . expensive to anywhere out of that zone .
neutral	ask them to put the part in a box that protects it from the postal people .
neutral	still cheaper_than the airport but be aware they cheat !
negative	you sent me the wrong wiper bushings for my dodge ( the package said they would fit ., not even close ) so its raining and i am going thru snow in the mountains pulling my sticking wipers by hand thinking about parts_geek who i cant get_ahold of anybody i already emailed you and got no response
neutral	the area is dark and dingy and leads one to believe that area at newark_airport is crime riddled .
positive	loved it , got it a day early . will be using again !
positive	i '_m sure glad i did !!!
negative	how do you run a business by not answering calls on a business day !
neutral	we booked a car from driveaway . com to pick_up at auckland airport .
positive	this was my first time applying for a passport and my trip was planned on a whim !
positive	simply the best .
negative	i redeem 0 eur voucher .
neutral	b_&_h is better_than many .
negative	surely there has to be a way to work through handling issues that arise in the moments after a reservation is made .
positive	i bought this chamilia bracel for a neighbours 00th_birthday_present ,.
neutral	i put it down to a live and learn experience .
positive	i haven_'_t had a product yet that my dogs haven_'_t loved .
negative	would email me .
neutral	but kind of frustrating .
neutral	was refunded but will have to wait for next order to buy them .
positive	an excellent service .
negative	then immediately after that call , that same representative called back and said " please disregard previous message that he thought there was only 0 rooms not 0 ".
negative	and that your review were not posted .
negative	he was the only one who didn_'_t have his copy .
neutral	well , went to get my box of ostomy_supplies i ordered and was surprised it was so heavy .
negative	probably my worst retail experience ever .
neutral	well , it didn_'_t work in my showroom and that '_s where it needs to work !!!!
positive	we found the tyres we needed online quite easily , and found the online system really easy to understand .
positive	good service , clean room and modern .

positive	recommended .
negative	i plan to tell_everyone i know ( friends , family , colleagues , clients , people on the street ) to stay far far away from travelocity .
negative	according to sales_reps this had nothing to do with a claim made in december ( and which multi_trip paid out only £_00 on , towards the £_000 i paid for medical treatment ) - i had specifically_asked if making the claim would impact on the extension premium as such a small claim could easily be outweighed by excess charges .
neutral	but i will say that 0 out of 00 calls to customer_service were handled fast and with exceptional service .
negative	if you ask me , i shouldn_'_t have to pay for the room at all !
positive	their comunication during the sale process is informative and easy to follow .

positive	i would order from them again .
neutral	my book came within a decent_amount of time .
positive	kept_informed at all_stages and delivery was at the time expected .
neutral	once you have purchased online you have the chance to leave a message for homebase , eg to leave item in safe place but there was a 0 day delay in dealing_with emails so that was pointless .
neutral	i would not order again if they used the same shipping company .
negative	the fact that they operate in the uk is the primary reason_why you should not deal with this company and should only deal with a us company .
negative	they generate generic e_-_mail responses for me , showing they do not read my e_-_mails !!!!
neutral	ordered a round pillow in hopes of filling the void in my neck while sleeping .
neutral	so do not expect a rapid service .
negative	my order was not fully processed and i completed a help ticket .

positive	very professional and kept us updated along the way .
positive	i loved that you had to sign for the delivery and they did not just leave it by the door .
negative	reading their return_policy is a lesson in buyer_beware . the customer pays return shipping even if the fault is partsgeek '_s .

positive	many_thanks .
neutral	now , sadly , like so many businesses , they have gotten greedy .
negative	i emailed customer_service and explained that my returns were based on the quality of the product which was unusable and not just a change of mind and i felt i should be reimbursed for all 0 jars as i had made several_attempts to talk to them .

neutral	the belt was shipped the same day and arrived on wednesday .
neutral	it was good in terms of product quality , but i didn_'_t really like the fact that they wouldn_'_t refund delivery when sending back a product for being too small , and expected me to pay the delivery back to them , for a £_00 product , it cost me £_00 total in delivery and returns .
negative	under the time estimate , it said it would take 0 - 0 days .
negative	the site does not tell you that any reservation you make is not instant , but is subject to them looking for a car that matches the reservation you make with them online .
negative	the idea is very good , now not target for the size and type of dogs at all , less say i own two small chihuahuas ans they send me things for a huge dog , obviously is like some one use size small and receive thing x large , , while the idea is good , not customized is not worth any thing !
negative	after a 00 minute phone_call travelocity was still unable to help me !
positive	it is great to be able to rely_on a company like this and i will_continue to purchase from them in the years to come .

positive	this watch really looks great .

negative	at 0 : 00hour i used my land_line placed a second call and to see .
neutral	good service , paid more for the items than was on the price tag .
neutral	but i would like the order corrected .
negative	upon_opening another package , another dress i ordered had come with a snapped belt - i really am not making this up , although you could be forgiven to think i was !
neutral	i am an old guy , 00 years , a professional who travels often on vacation and rents cars frequently .
positive	i will use partsgeek .
neutral	so a 00lb alternator boxed shipping cost is half the savings i would have
negative	i guess legal_action is next .
positive	good quality , good price branded goods .
neutral	internet_explorer has_been routinely shown to have security flaws and prone to hacking , making secure transactions an unnerving venture , but i was in a hurry and your site was most reasonably_priced so i went_ahead .
negative	representative said that a full_refund would be issued after they verified that i had not picked_up the car .
negative	i informed the operator that my bf was there in the parking_lot and needed a room for the night .
negative	their price was good and they promised next_day delivery .
negative	our purchase was returned to the shipper becuz of this situation and their reply was we will refund you money .
neutral	the address on the packaging was correct but the advice note inside was for a lady in truro .
neutral	( i . e .
negative	t00ds00k
negative	you need to get better logistics and improve your delivery time .
neutral	their reasoning is sound but i dislike the way they handled my query .
negative	do not use in any way shape or form !
negative	i placed this order with my credit_card and it was being shipped to my billing_address - nothing was out of the ordinary !
positive	much_appreciated !
neutral	i '_ll be looking out for the promo_codes .
negative	after numerous_attempts to get them to do what was right , they finally flat out told me they wouldn_'_t fix my problem .
positive	for expensive photography purchases online , trust is number one .
neutral	i observed every message through ur network don_'_t get delivered .
neutral	they gave_me a dislocated phone_number and the address information was not where the facility was located .
neutral	the balance of the rewards card isn_'_t deducted from the total , and when i chatted with customer service to find out why this wasn_'_t working , i was told that reward card balances aren_'_t deducted from the total , but that i wouldn_'_t be charged the full_amount .
positive	all thre operations are very easy to do online and for me it is important to save_money and time .
neutral	the tracking_system did not give a specific place of where it was delivered .
positive	thanks , definately ordering again from this company .
negative	she was going to call fedex .
negative	!
neutral	so not really sure where this is coming from and thus does not allow you to check the status of your delivery .
neutral	i am still resolving an issue with a part that arrived damaged .
negative	it '_s a rip_off .
neutral	had to gall twice to get satisfaction .
neutral	or original price
negative	when i went to the office to check they had a real hard time finding them .
positive	i have purchased 0 pairs of specs from selectspecs . com and the service i received was second to none even_though the spec were cheap it didn_'_t change the service
neutral	put in another support_ticket 00 / 00 / 00 .
neutral	if you ' re having a sale , why should the customer have to run this down .
positive	i have nothing but good to say , good price , good prompt service and good products . they kept me informed thru email on confirmation of order and good tracking_info on all three of my orders .
positive	after i set my alerts nothing will go thru without me knowing about it and it also protects from out of the ordinary charges with out me knowing about it .
negative	reseller ratings allows people to post reviews about your company , even if they have never done business with you .
neutral	the part got to me a day later than_expected considering i paid for 0day shipping this is all i have to complain_about and undamaged and fit like it was supposed too thanks to parts_geek and there low_prices
neutral	if so , then they could learn a bit from their us counterparts .
negative	i have shopped at rockauto for years and then i noticed partsgeek had better prices .
neutral	this would be resolved if i returned said hat .
neutral	lidt bøvlet at sende retur ( lægge penge ud / få penge retur ) ekstra forsendelsesomkostning til følge .
neutral	every time i go , ( 0rd time now ) the associates tell me a front_end alignment is useless , that all 0 wheels should be aligned .
positive	the only issue came when fixing the top part of the dresser to the base .
neutral	is it not possible for a courier to take_care of parcels - is this not their job and what i am paying for !
neutral	their idea of convenient customer service is to have customers write them an_email to which they will respond within 00 - 00_hours .
positive	i requested to keep my phone .
negative	i was lucky to escape a call out charge .
positive	ordered through amazon .
positive	will i use again ?
neutral	i paid for second day delivery but my merchandise was shipped regular ground ( approx five days ).
negative	as i was walking to get bags the shuttle just took off and left .
negative	it took four weeks to get the money - they claim they haven_'_t received it for ages ( but they know it '_s on the way !)
positive	none of them compare to the great selection and prices at supplement_warehouse .
neutral	first , the order was sent in two packages .
positive	this is a very good search_tool !
positive	would order again .
positive	as i '_m conditioned to expect after 00 years of dealing_with b_&_h , excellent service and products .
neutral	am waiting for replacement .
neutral	recieved the 0 led_lights as ordered , 0 worked one did not .
negative	i expect a full_refund and compensation for the wait and the associated stress as well as the additional_cost to me .
negative	i already have school assignments that were due , where i needed the book for answers and reference .
neutral	the shipping_charges can be nearly_half as much as the order .
neutral	so i had to choose which flavor had the most damaged_cans to replace .
positive	when they have the product you want in stock they cannot be_beaten .
neutral	i don_'_t mind providing my phone_number to be used in case there is a problem with my order , but calling to give me a simple update when an_email would suffice seemed unnecessary .
negative	i had paid the full_amount otherwise for the order .
negative	we immidiately called and spent about 00_minutes to 0 hour on the phone with vairous people the basic response was we cannot see the flights you are seeing ( we offered to email a screen print from bookit . com to validate our claim but this was not accepted .).
positive	as many aspiring and pro guys will tell you once the camera bug addiction hits you find yourself always needing more equipment but on a budget you have to pick and choose what sites and what return_policies work for you and for the most part i do small cheap things at other_places but my big ticket items ( canon_0d mark_iii etc ) i use b_&_h because the last thing you want to run_into is have trouble returning an item due to a cheap websites policy with b_&_h i '_m very secure with the policy plus they have guys they will guide you into the correct purchase not pressure sell you on an expensive item .
negative	wont be have my business again
neutral	on placing my order on 0rd may , i was told that the 0 items were out of stock and would be available in 0_weeks .
positive	they were timely and professional and what else can i say , provoiceusa . com is my first call for all my voice over needs .
positive	i went to petflow where i found the same food for $_00 . 00 more , but they only charged a flat_rate shipping fee of $ 0 . 00 if you didn_'_t qualify for the free shipping .
negative	when i first started doing_business with petflow . com i requested for autoshipping for my dog_food .
positive	this site has great prices , shipping rates , and customer service !
neutral	the quality of the bleeding kit was marginal .
positive	they would have been much more costly if purchased in the store and i have not seen a similar product locally .
positive	!
neutral	when i finally realized this , the item had already been delivered and released ( because i gave ups permission to release the item without a signature ).
positive	i ' d recommend this company to anyone !
negative	i called the company royal_canin and they advised petflow carried it .
positive	on the strength of a well_organised web_site i went_ahead and l placed an order for an office_chair .
positive	they had everything i was looking for .
positive	in my first order ive got a little problem , but they were very fast and efficient to resolve it .
positive	i also like their stock watch function as it saves you having to keep looking at the site for product sizes your interested in .
positive	they also looked at a knocking noise coming from my car which i had noticed but did not know what it was .
negative	am i missing something ?
neutral	not every guest on airbnb is a good guest and airbnb needs to stop hiding the star_review information that hosts leave for guests and be fully transparent so each guest is reviewed both with written reviews and stars .
positive	the food is good -- and breakfast delicious .
neutral	i might as well just buy directly from the manufactures .
negative	baracuta , if you are reading this , can you please reply to my email .
negative	no communication , after attempts at getting in touch i receive no replies .
neutral	the he following_day there was another offer but not as good .
neutral	wish i would of had a choice on shipping .
neutral	having had boohoo recommended to me i decided to look online and place an order in time for the party weekend i had planned .
negative	so they refused the refund and even_though i took the time to write a letter to dominic farriley it met with a completely negative response .
negative	i had to return three items due to ordering incorrect items and re - order the correct replacements .
positive	i have used their automated
neutral	!
negative	charged credit_card , hold the order and don_'_t ship out your order .
negative	so be warned don_'_t buy from furniture village .
neutral	the appliance arrived when they said it would and it was fitted correctly and efficiently .
neutral	when i emailed to try and sort this i was informed that the company was unable to refund the cost .
neutral	i can '_t say definitively that i was being lied to regarding the time frame , but maybe the giftcard . com rep i spoke with was ." mistaken ".
neutral	however if there are any_problems with the collection or delivery of the item that quickly changes with them perfectly capable of telling a pack of lies and quite prepared to become belligerent and rude .
negative	which was the same exact charge and same date on the confirmation from voip pbx express .
neutral	when i received my order , the receipt indicated that one of the products was on back order .
negative	huge mistake this time !
positive	we decided to get married 0 days before we actually got married .
neutral	i don_'_t think i will buy from again due to this .
neutral	later i had password troubles so i had to call for reset .
neutral	i am concered about shippping though - my order went in on 0 . and i have had not updates or seen my product since then .
positive	!
positive	so easy to find what we were looking for .
neutral	although did mess about with the day of getting tyre_fitted .
neutral	in terms of price wise , the service is okay , however the shuttle service has a lot of rooms for improvements .
positive	i was very impressed with their commitment to me , their customer , and do not_hesitate to recommend them wholeheartedly .
neutral	they were quite prompt in delivering me the check for $_000 for the phone '_s full original value .
neutral	the last email i sent didn_'_t even get a response .
neutral	hopefully the new fan in my wife '_s jetta keeps going longer_than 0yrs this time .
neutral	upon purchasing a dishwasher i was disappointed that it was left to me to chase up delivery 0_weeks_later .
positive	two months later i called them back , made final payment and had the chairs delivered less_than a week_later .
positive	thanks .
neutral	they asked for a cr card number to hold room but the charge appeared on my card this morning !
neutral	i would have expected the csr that took my reservation to tell me that in advance especially_since the bill was for more than $_000 .
neutral	would have been less hassle to pay a bit more and purchase them at our local newsagents , which we will do in the future , as we can '_t sit at home and wait for a delivery .
negative	when i called , i was told , " good news !
negative	and i have to leave my shop untended to sign for this item .
positive	this company delivered with excellence , from the time of order to delivery and the trophies were very impressive .
positive	i will_definitely use pc_game_supply again
negative	jeg_er normalt ikke én der brokker sig over det_ene og_det andet , men i tilfældet med vinduespudser_clausen ( tidligere : vipudservinduer ) vil_jeg gøre en berettiget undtagelse .
positive	i ordered a toner_cartridge at 0 :_00am and it arrived the same day around_0pm !
negative	i ordered about a hundred_dollars worth of items and never received my shipment and it '_s been two_weeks
negative	each hotel clerk told us is was because we booked it through bookit . com that a deposited is required .
negative	the moral of this story is , dont listen to them , if your parcel has not arrived in 00 days , make a dispute on paypal , if its not there by 00 days , ask for a refund , your item will arrive in 00 days of you esculating .
positive	the blinds arrived on time , were complete with all parts and easy to hang .
neutral	based on recent events with my psvita case being sent to the wrong_address and my copy of final fantasy 00 - 0 outright not turning up i would have to go with so - so
positive	i found what i needed and was kept up to date on the progress of my order throughout .
neutral	they ' re ok , just overpriced .
positive	the price was really good aswell so over all i was very pleased with this company and wil definately be using them again .
neutral	the only_reason i will probably stop using them is that the box they come in is 00cm unneccessarily big and this means they do not fit through the letterbox and i have to go to post_office to pick_up parcel - this defeats the point in ordering online which i do as i work long hours .
positive	there is something for everyone . literally !
negative	anyways , i had to reschedule delivery for another day ( booking a second day off work ) to wait on my bed .
positive	a service i will use again in the future .
negative	it was a real_shame that this was my initial experience when i first arrived to sydney .
neutral	depends what your looking for but most things i '_ve purchased have not been made that well but they haven_'_t cost a fortune so it goes to show you get what you pay for !
positive	they not only save me money but great perks are always part of the deals .
neutral	to save £_00 i waited two_weeks to get the same product from an_alternative source .
neutral	had to wait one day .
negative	did not work , all black & white , showes non_- hp cart . are thay refills ?
negative	who don_'_t let you off the phone .
positive	this is the only place i go for my supplements !!!!
negative	i want an immediate full_refund
negative	so would i recommend asda , never in a million years .
neutral	return_authorization #_0000000 .
neutral	i have rented several textbooks in the past from other_vendors and i would say this one has_been in the poorest condition .
negative	tried to email the company , no email listed on the website .
positive	cheap prices for quality products along with free_samples and products .
negative	so i called the company today to order it and was told by the employee , " kelly ," that it was still available and she added it to my order that was to be shipped out tomorrow .
neutral	this is proved by the fact that guests are not reviewed with stars in public and their star_ratings are hidden .
negative	we lost our $_000 that was held my wepay .
neutral	i have other company '_s that i can buy from and i could have gotten what i ordered from them .
neutral	i had a very hard time reading the two words you have to retype .
neutral	jennifer clayton
positive	this is the only formula that she has_been able to do well with , and she_loves it !
negative	they offered me a refound , but as we are close to the travel date now , all other tickets are much more_expensive now !
negative	i called back .
neutral	processed 0 orders , 0 onlineand second over phone but ended_up wtih 0 wrong items as product info .
neutral	we could not book a full group and avail of our discount .
neutral	the incorrect part was in the manufacture '_s box .
neutral	after only a couple of months the price was increased .
neutral	other than that , if you spend the time to research , you can actually find some great deals for resale .
negative	the large catalog did impress me , i ordered a dress , and 0 pairs of shoes .
negative	they were on back order , and apparently sent to me mid - feb . my credit_card has_been charged and i have not received them : it is now feb_00th .
negative	there does not seem to be an easy way to contact them .
negative	there are strings hanging from the jacket and there is a cut by the zipper
neutral	but the coffee is really watery - tasting !
neutral	when i ordered these parts in good faith i also thought you would pay for the cores but just to find out you charge dubble shippng , good parts but will not ever order anything anymore from u again .
neutral	perhaps i should order my compression sleeves from them .
positive	i '_m very pleased with the way the lettering came out , and would certainly buy from you again .
negative	i informed parts_geek of this , asked either for an adjustment of the price so that i could go out and purchase new nuts , or that they could ship these small items to me to complete the order .
positive	where did it come from ?
negative	the cassette box was not well secured and the wheel packaging was torn and sloppily repacked .
negative	when i questioned her she could not give me a reasonable explanation for change .
positive	incredible service !!!
neutral	carpet threw out hotel was stained every where !
neutral	$ 0 . 00 tacked on to each ticket for doing nothing is offensive .
negative	?
neutral	you never want to mislead customers into buying something they won_'_t get until days or weeks_later , it '_s just not how business is done .
neutral	the site was very easy to use , and the cartridges arrived quickly .
positive	the actual buildings can be run down looking , but aldi has got it where it counts .
negative	they say it takes 0 - 00 days to refund , which is just wrong as it took them less_than a day to take the money .
positive	excellent company placed my orders with both play and hmv prior to finding shopto 0 different items both arrived exactly when they said and i still had time to cancel my orders with the others
neutral	lost an_hour going around the park .
neutral	the price for 0 parts_geek lights is a lot less_than 0 toyota light .
positive	got my order a day early !!!
negative	i called the listed number for customer service 0 or 0 times but there was no one there and the phone_call is kicked to a message center .
neutral	it may been better to send the bigger box with only the cat_litter in it .
negative	sincerely ,
neutral	they upped the prices three_times within five_minutes of me trying to book my trip .
neutral	we apologize that you haven_'_t received your entire order and we have sent an e_-_mail over to the manufacturer to request the location of the remainder .
positive	excellent service , delivery , parts , and quality .
negative	why so long .
neutral	does that mean that the famous g0 is being discontinued ?
negative	i '_m so mad right now .
negative	i had to contact the company who did not even apologise and did not understand the need to inform the customer that a . the order had been received and b . it had been dispatched .
neutral	the same occurred this time when i booked the car with auto_europe in the usa and had their rental_car for the entire period of 00 days i spent in germany till june 00 .
negative	en_las condiciones escritas , dice que la tarjeta sera utilizada solo como garantía de reserva pero el pago total de_la reserva solo será efectivizado en_el hotel siempre y cuando se respeten los plazos de vencimiento .
negative	they also blocked 0 names from posting on their facebook_page and deleted every post i had made for sharing my experience .
neutral	and setup an_email account for it .
positive	he was more helpful that any other tire store that i have purchased tires from .
positive	it was sent promptly and arrived in good condition
neutral	we recommended it to our friends as we were going on holiday together and all went well until i rang up to collect the cars late on a rainy night .
negative	i tried_calling customer service but not surprisingly there '_s no customer service , just an_automated answering system directing you to the website so i sent an_email request for a return ticket or number but not surprisingly haven_'_t heard back yet , it '_s been almost a week not .
positive	they are efficient , trustworthy and always helpful - a pleasure to deal with .
positive	excellent customer_service fast delivery would use again , thank_you gak
positive	lots of options on delivery timescale and price you pay .
neutral	positive_comments : delivery was exceptionally fast , probably because it was shipped from within 00 miles of my residency .
neutral	and the wait for someone to contact you back is sooooooo slow !
neutral	i called to see why this happened and if i could get $_00 bucks back with no luck .
neutral	they removed the extra_charge , in the office .
positive	they then send the tyres to a local_garage near you who '_ll contact you with a time to fit them while you wait , it '_s so easy .
positive	outstanding price and prompt delivery !
positive	their service is great .
positive	i recommend giving priceline a try !
negative	so , needless to say , i went to another company to book . disappointed
neutral	it took me a while to figure this out , since my only feedback was " hey , you missed a field or two , please finish "
negative	i gave them these question on dec - 00 .
neutral	i ordered a necklace as a christmas gift for my sister , and i understand that it takes time to actually make the product , but i don_'_t think it should take 00 - 00 days to be shipped after getting the " your order has_been shipped " confirmation .
positive	unfortunately had a faulty part but when i rang customer_support no problem , immediately despatched replacement which arrived again next_day and collected the faulty item , wonderful service can '_t be_faulted , will_definitely purchase from again .
positive	i rarely write_reviews but these_folks deserve the praise .
positive	prices are competitive , delivery is faultless and if you have any questions their customer_service are always fast to respond and eager to help !
neutral	my treadmill is performing o . k at the moment , but i still put off by this extra - 00 ukps delivery fee for my possible purchases !!!
positive	the rep we had david_chan , was charming , knowledgeable about their products , and very patient .
negative	before we were finished the phone_call dropped and i called back .
positive	we received our order very quickly and are very pleased with the quality .
neutral	so my advice is to check very carefully when you receive anything , and ring them there and then if there is a problem !
neutral	failing that , and not wanting the inconvenience i would have returned the item by post .
positive	felt_like christmas !!
neutral	after our recent stay at a hotel booked through alpharooms i was sent an e_- mail requesting me to write a review on our stay at the hotel .
positive	jimmy - from gak . co . uk was superb .

positive	all the reviews of vacation spots , rentals , hotels , restaurants , entertainment , activities , adventure and much , much more are right there in one spot for you to read and decide where you want to go and what you want to do when you get there .
negative	she was rude , gave_me wrong information and because she took an_hour to do nothing she lost me $_000 as the price went up while she was trying to figure_out how to make my reservation .
neutral	the goods arrived in good condition on time .
negative	then refused .
positive	great service , products and price .
positive	!
positive	i am very satisfied with shopping at pet - supermarket the staff are very friendly and delivery is very quick .

neutral	i ordered some parts for my 0000_audi s0 and the experience was pleasant and the order was filled to almost satisfactory needs .
positive	well_done .
negative	guess once they lock in the sale and good reviews , all their_promises go right out the window .
positive	some of them i ruled out right_away , but there were numerous really good ones .
positive	i '_ve just started taking shroom - tech , so i '_ll have to review that later .
negative	we have been waiting over 0_weeks and still do not have parts .
negative	the only_reason we called the reservation number was because we were using a credit_card that typically offers discounted rates on hotel_rooms ( which they ended_up not being_able to help us with anyway as we have to wait_until we check in to the hotel ).
neutral	ordered the spare part , paid for next_day delivery .
positive	very efficient service

negative	you have to purchase a brand_new ticket , then fill_out endless paperwork , and then " hope " you get some sort of refund , which almost a month later , i still have not received notification on .
positive	they were honest , quick , and as far as i know , the product is okay .

negative	i did not like the time the flight was arriving with the hotel package deal so i changed our flight to an early one ( arriving at new_orleans at 0 :_00pm ).
neutral	0 : priceline would take a huge step in calming anxiety among hotel bidders if they would simply allow us to name # of beds , bed type , & smoking / non_- smoking .
neutral	when we walked there our car was there , very prompt which was a good point . i noticed straight_away that a light_bulb had blown , but the driver did not mention this .

neutral	i could only get so_far on their website and i would get , " your order is being_processed and will be despatched as soon as possible ", which_meant i had to go back to the start because i had not put in any financial details which they hadn_'_t asked for , this happened very several_times until i had success !!!!!
positive	had problems with my first order but they were happy to help and quickly replaced the item

neutral	just fyi , if you deliver to the channel_islands , they have their own postage stamps .
neutral	otherwise , if you can be bothered , you may as well use the parcels - smashers ( er . " couriers ") they represent directly , because they are usually a bit cheaper .
negative	if a class action could be started for the abysmal customer_service that expedia puts out there , i would have no_qualms about being rewarded . 00_cents ( or whatever it is class members get these days ) just so expedia could be exposed for their complete and utter disregard of properly treating customers .

neutral	samtidig med at jeg siger jeg_har_fået dårlig service vil_jeg dog pointere at jeg_synes det_er super flot , at komplett . dk ikke " taber mig " her til sidst og bare sender kortet retur men stadig holder ved og giver mig en_ny metode til måske at et_nyt og ikke defekt kort , netop ved at hjælpe_mig igennem ved at fortælle mig at jeg_kan skirve til msi .

positive	fast and safety service .
positive	i have never gotten the wrong part from them so i can '_t speak to how well they handle any errors but the fact that after a high number of transactions i have not run_into one yet seems to speak well for the operation .

neutral	i believe it was the airline who contacted me to let_me know my flight was canceled , not travelocity .
negative	i had already a horrible experience with a flipkey traveler , who was a scammer and ended_up costing me a lot of money and i was on my own , so definitely will not allow any flipkey traveler in my home unless i speak to them first

positive	delivery was fast and i loved how i could track the progress of assembly online .

negative	thanks corporate hospitality .
neutral	the moral of the story : if you need a cheap battery and you don_'_t care where it was made , then this is the place to get it .
neutral	other than that , priceline has saved us a lot of money on hotels and rental_cars .
neutral	still_waiting !
negative	they mistaken my address , it was supposed that the had come to my place to bring it to me , but they didn_'_t .

positive	i would recommend and will use again .

neutral	this is my first experience using your service .
negative	tried to sort this out and was ignored .
positive	by the way when you are told a date for delivery .
neutral	in other words , " i don_'_t care about customer_service "
neutral	based on parts_geek '_s price statement that they researched to insure they had the lowest_price and the fact that the price i paid was so much higher , i sent an_email to customer service with a link to the web_page showing the item .
negative	when ask about when item was shipped they just reply with tracking_number and have a nice day .
neutral	past experience has_been to leave feeling as though i have been ripped_off somehow .
positive	excellent service , very happy with purchase .
neutral	i can only explain it as frayed but obviously with paper .
positive	the response was almost_immediate and an offer was made to contact me .
negative	not make customer wait .
neutral	item will be sent back .

positive	it was my first order and i will_definitely come_back to order more .
positive	at a reasonable price , they led us through every_step , asked questions we hadn_'_t thought of , and gave_us a site we are proud of .
neutral	some of the order still_hasn_'_t arrived so not impressed so_far .
positive	i was very impressed with flashbay '_s service level and product quality .
negative	0 .
negative	it seems that they will let in negative_reviews to try and get you to pay for their service so you can bring your rating back up . that is not a fair and accurate representation and its bordering on criminal .
negative	a week to ship a part from new_jersey is bad !
positive	as i shop for plane_tickets online i always come_back to travelocity .
positive	i can '_t_believe the shipping is so fast and somehow free !
negative	a few hours after this email i received a direct email from their customer service team asking if i would like the flowers to still be delivered .
negative	the third night we stayed there the room had not done housekeeping and there were no towels for baths .
negative	you cannot see outside of the complex whatsoever .
negative	to me , it wasn_'_t a change , it was a correction for a problem that they made !
neutral	seemed like the agent was trying to find a way to charge me .
positive	on another occasion i needed some advice which i received clearly and concisely .
negative	despite this , i contacted my bank and went through the steps provided to me in the email sent by partsgeek .
neutral	however , i was not totally sure it was the correct part and i wanted to talk to someone about it .
negative	needless to say , i booked the vehicle , a 0 - seater suv , well in advance to make_sure we got a decent price and that there were still vehicles available .
negative	this is absolutely asinine .
positive	i just ordered for the first time from sw and i will tell you , with the plenty of research i did in attempts to find the best prices . sw took the cake .
neutral	for example , if i enter the cc_info and i have to edit something on the shipping address , it deletes the cc_info .
negative	very disappointed .
negative	i am very worried_about this product and company .
positive	i am very satisfied .
positive	thankyou merlin

positive	call 00_minutes ahead , drive to holiday_inn , hand over car & keys , grab your suitcases and cross the road to the terminal_building .
negative	i did all the work of finding out what went wrong with the order and apparently partsgeek still_hasn_'_t contacted the post_office to correct the problem .
negative	confirmed that they could come to my house and put new tyres on .
negative	booku flight last night and after i clearly selected the flight i want , they change it back to another flight once i submitted my payment .
neutral	with online shopping , i no_longer have that experience .
neutral	in summary , big_bus failed in that it should have mentioned this on their website .
positive	very quick and professional answers to all my concerns regarding my purchase .
positive	:) thank_you !!
negative	and after_reading different reviews on boohoo it would seem i am not alone !

negative	received cheap plastic replacement parts .
negative	when the box arrived , the label said 00 ' x 00 ' blue cover but they sent me a 00 ' round white solar_cover .
negative	i tried to call , however they are closed and the voice_message refers me to go online .
neutral	you should offer one flat_rate shipping fee or when you have met the amount set for free_shipping you should be able to use the discount_code as well !!!!!!
neutral	0 : 00_pm .
positive	two things that are a must when booking a trip for a short get away .
neutral	shame no card was left .
neutral	also , if someone can call me regarding the bag , that would be great .
negative	this place is garbage and would not recommend to anyone .
negative	i was charged for it , the money is gone , but i still have no game .
positive	really love the nike golf shirts with our company logo on them .
neutral	it '_s a real_shame because everything we ordered was really nice and had the size been ok we would have kept everything .
negative	so the next 0 hrs were spent with pain in my legs .
neutral	the bus takes those people directly to the gate with little mobility issues .
neutral	i can not complain regarding their delivery service but and this is a big but .
negative	they gave ups a different shipping address .
negative	we will never use bravofly again
neutral	i would order from them again , but please take_note of my comments .

neutral	the delivery was made sometime in the afternoon - i was at work by then , i had left a note for the driver - which he hadn_'_t read and was greeted with an overwhelming smell of kerosene when i returned from work - i bet i got charged for the spillage !
positive	she helped pick songs , ran our rehearsal , worked with the wedding coordinator and venue and ultimately made our wedding day better_than we could have hoped for .

neutral	i bought a selection of flavors and strengths .
neutral	we nearly got stranded !
neutral	rewards_program is great .
positive	the guides were adequately trained for safe city cycling as well as adding hearty commentary for all of the sights we saw along the way .
neutral	the service was very quick .
neutral	the delivery did indeed turn up the next_day but unfortunately it was the wrong item .
positive	it came the next_morning which was brilliant and the mattress is excellent too .
neutral	automated follow ups are not followed_up on by a rep .
positive	on the day of delivery i was able to track the progress of the delivery using the unique order refernece number .
neutral	and due to our extremely tight_budget i have to wait for a pay day ( and i only get paid once a month ) before i can buy jeans in the correct size and send off the off the small size to and wait for my refund .
neutral	quick confirmation of purchase via_email .
negative	and i got a generic gift_card .
negative	when we booked the car we wanted a reliable hire company so that is why we went with driveaway and hertz .
neutral	perhaps , this is the case just for the trains i was booking . also , if tickets do need to be sent to an address it would be good to send them further than just the uk .
positive	goods are always delivered really quickly , the prices are great and , if you ever have an issue , it is resolved quickly and courteously .
negative	trick me once shame on you .
neutral	not only is $ 0 high for suck a cheap part , but having to pay it twice made my experience even worse .
negative	it was sent in a box that was half the size of the actual grille , which i thought was odd when i received the package from the mailman .

neutral	fiz a primeira compra e ainda tô ansioso se vai dar certo mesmo , espero que corra tudo bem !
negative	bookit on the other hand would not allow me to cancel online due to the 00 hour_window even_though we were more than 00_hours from our originally scheduled check in time .
negative	today they sent me a e_-_mail telling_me that they changed my flight and i will be stock in lisbon for 00_hrs and be in italy at 00 . 00_pm . way too_late for my wedding .
neutral	a big lesson_learnt for me , never book multiple carriers because if one drops out of the loop your whole schedule is messed_up and not easy to fix .
negative	to be fair , it wasn_'_t directly muscle_foods fault , it was due to the fact of the very unreliable yodel service that they use that don_'_t seem to know their eyes from their a *** and deliver your perishable goods in a van that '_s not even refrigerated .
positive	the member of staff who dealt_with my enquiry was very knowlegable and helpful .
positive	love their lowest_price guarantee and all the free product we get to try before we buy .
positive	having twice purchased from fashion eyewear i thoroughly_recommend this company for a truly stress_free experience .
neutral	the staff could have been a lot more friendly ( except for the one young girl who spoke_english ) and attempt to lessen our stress and what we were going to do next if they didn_'_t come up with the goods .
neutral	great prices but some of the treats were really small
positive	overall satisfied .
neutral	huge_selection of parts and good prices but at a pretty big cost . partsgeek customer service is essentially non_- existent .
neutral	this was a huge diminishment of services without a price reduction in my opinion .
neutral	the top models i see are charging over $_000 worth of tokens just to get them nude .
neutral	also , i have had issues with printing usps labels .
positive	i got the light and my son installed it in 0 minutes .
negative	i am very disappointed in this service , that is to say , no service at all .
positive	now with the barker extended electric tongue jack it '_s a breeze .
negative	it would help greatly if they had a central help_desk just like their parts to deal with customer service .
neutral	which means i need a pointer !
positive	i was very relieved when i got my glasses - they were perfect .
positive	they have a great assortment and sale prices .
positive	no gimmick !
neutral	in all fairness it could have been my mistake .
positive	(;-)
neutral	i accept there was a delayed response to my complaint but no intent to ignore the problem
neutral	obviously our usps has not cared to continue the process of my merchandise .
positive	i knew i will take mine from the same place , and i did !
negative	loan behold bookit . com seemed to have a great option for her .
positive	the prices are reasonable for great quality food and the delivery to my door is awesome !
negative	after some time , i have been able to arrange a re - delivery for my parcel .
positive	i '_ve been using b_&_h for about 00 years and have depended on them to get the professional equipment i need in a timely_manner and at a fair price .
neutral	i '_ll let you know if i ever receive the package .
negative	they do not answer their phone or return emails .
negative	jeg_har ingen telefon så_jeg_kan_ikke afbestille spotify som_jeg åbenbart skal_betale ekstra for nu , og_jeg_kan_ikke få_en låne telefon .
neutral	response service , " which i did receive ", the part i ordered was correct & did receive promptly .
negative	not good , and never bravofly again !
negative	i have attempted to bid on this companies auctions on ebay , however , every time i submit a bid , it is blocked by the company .
negative	and i am expected to pay return shipping .
negative	would still use yodel apart_from cost savings that outweigh the horrible quality of service .
neutral	the bus was more_expensive , had basically two routes ( one short , one long ), and ended early ( around 0 :_00pm ).
negative	the hydrangea i sent to my daughter arrived without a single bloom or even a leaf that was opened .
neutral	when i returned home , i found that the pressure in the tire was significantly overinflated ( the pressure in the untouched tires was fine ).
neutral	kind of disappointing but i guess they handled it well .
negative	i tried everything to get logged on .
positive	will use this company again .
positive	it was very satisfying , to find my item was exactly_what it said on the discription .
positive	i also happen to be out of metrx .
neutral	i asked for an explanation of the gps device we were renting which he had simply thrust in our direction .
negative	in addition , he was charged for the voucher and also the full price for the flowers .
negative	waited_until 0 . 00 and rang - guess what interparcel close at 0 . 00 !!
positive	this is a wonderful service and my item shipped quickly and on time .
neutral	so 0 and a half weeks_later i might get the part i needed a week_ago .
positive	i love that they text when the vehicle is done so i don_'_t have to wait around .
neutral	our next guide was good but too bad we weren_'_t on the bus long after that .
neutral	i liked that you could sort by price or availability , but what the site really needs is the ability to sort by proximity to a location .
negative	en overflødig udgift der skønsmæssigt beløber sig til fire et halvt tusinde kroner .
neutral	i like the value of the discounts but sometimes a seat will be in a less desirable area or picking_up tickets is in the back of the venue ( ballpark ).
neutral	no problem with merlin at all .
neutral	who will bother to complain for ten bucks ?
positive	this time my order was quicker_than last time .
negative	i can '_t use the sweaters and it '_s very cold up here and they need them badly .
positive	the european walnut worktops that we ordered look fantastic , we are really pleased with them , the picture on the website doesn_'_t do them justice , after the coats of the oil recommended they are a really lovely colour .
positive	with that number , it happens , that a booking needs to be changed or cancelled .

neutral	thus , i will have to call this evening to hopefully receive the refund .
negative	they don_'_t tell you the name of the hotel because if they did , you would not book .
positive	allerede næste morgen modtog jeg en mail om , at mine_penge var ført retur !!
negative	my recipient was gracious .
neutral	the only_negative_thing about appliances_online and its potentially a big negative was the aggressive tactics of the sales guy trying to sell us the insurance on the fridge we were buying .
positive	go_ahead and book online now
neutral	lost entire room price .
positive	great price , fast shipping , all the correct parts
negative	the only communication is by email which is bogus when it was all your fault .

neutral	not true to the picture .
positive	the delivery was very quick .
neutral	upset , i emailed customer_service .
neutral	when i emailed to complain , no compensation or even apology as far as i remember was offered .
neutral	also , the tpms service light ( not a flat_tire ) came on immediately , i wasnt 00 miles from the dealership !
neutral	i went to send back my cores for my brake_calipers and it was going to be $_00 . 00 for shipping .
negative	they wont answer the phone or respond tp emails
negative	they are a reseller without_any expertise and will send out cheap auto part substitutes so they can keep your payment .
negative	thanx god , that '_s not about the real amount - ' cause the rental had to be for 0 day only .
negative	reservation agents answer the call in seconds .
neutral	however i didn_'_t like that the containers of shampoo and such was only half full .

neutral	i '_ve had my brother help me as well and as he works in it , i value his opinion and he thinks this is the worst , most user unfriendly site he has seen .
negative	i felt_like i was sent seconds .
positive	the outdoor_shop has really good prices on products and delivers on time .

positive	i hope you gays keep the standar .

neutral	so glad i spent $_00 to try on a pair of birkenstocks ?
neutral	also , the mobile_app is outdated and will not load onto our phones .
positive	helpful on phone discussion of what was needed , rapid despatch
neutral	i will admit that it makes me a little_worried that my life could depend_on those tires .
negative	it has_been 0 days and still no response .
negative	why would i bid 000 !
neutral	the trouble began with your choice of delivery company .
negative	poor , not impressed .

positive	i have used hostelworld to source accommodation for travel , both business and work , for several_years_now and have been able to rely_on the information they provide about the accommodation , especially through the reviews section which gives up date feedback ( because places can go through changes too for a variety of reasons ).
negative	contacted iflorist and they eventually delivered them 0 week_later .
neutral	( msmsnic @ _____ . ___ ) your rep . jessy asked me for it .
positive	i contacted jacada travel online and sam immediately reached out to me .
positive	you just setup your account and payment_options i like to use paypal and moments_later its done and they email you your codes .

neutral	when i called the woman i spoke with was very helpful in assisting_me find a location that fit into my budget .
negative	i just left it at that , and ended_up not giving them my business .
negative	when ordering description was much_better that actual product .
negative	if you value service and reliability , my advice is take their rate and see if a competitor will match it !
positive	booking was so easy via the net and then had contact with the carlton road branch to confirm and talk through some of the details .
neutral	boohoo do not have a phone_number which makes them very difficult to get hold of .
neutral	i buy one product in bulk , perpsi rock which is a good product but it needs some attention in terms of product delivery system to make it more appealing .
neutral	minimum order of 000_litres is unrealistic when prices are so high , - you should offer a " top up " system until ( if ever ) prices become less extortionate .
negative	fedex also have some of the least helpful and least friendly customer service teams this side of royal_mail .
positive	bike tires direct has always met or exceeded my expectations .
neutral	i ' taking it to my certified bmw technician for help .

negative	i fitted the shaft trimming to size from the top as he said .
positive	get it fast and easy
negative	do not use parts_geek for anything .
positive	better_than_expected !
negative	but didnt even give a courtesy_call ??
neutral	i immediately emailed the company and received a reply the next_day .
neutral	similarly , you have to be a silver member to talk to customer_service reps which i feel is a bit unfair on those who have genuine problems , but because they have not bought enough can not talk to someone there and then .
positive	booze delivery ?
positive	will not_hesitate to use this company again .
neutral	i was disappointed when i got wowcher vouchers for only half what i had paid when my son was sent to afghanistan .
neutral	they came when you said they would with free shipping .
negative	i had to call them to find out the status .
negative	i wax away for three_days and on my return found a not through my door asking me to contact them .
negative	my transfer is in labor !
positive	thank_you !
neutral	we just had to clean the heads and then everything worked great .
positive	the glasses still arrived earlier_than i had expected and am completely happy with my order .
neutral	were wrong . i don_'_t think in this case i should have to pay return shipping .
neutral	the car was filthy when i got it ( on the outside ) and was in a dark garage so i didn_'_t notice the dents then .
neutral	so i ordered from inkfarm .
negative	terrible customer_service very rude agents
neutral	mcdonald '_s gets a lot of bad press for the nutritional quality of their food .
positive	no_problems , no_worries .
positive	i felt very comfortable using pureformulas . com for my purchase .
positive	sos day .
negative	they say is the city of san_jose policy .
neutral	a little disappointed .
neutral	simply ask me how many bags i would like to pay for when i make the reservation , and discount or add to the initial price so it is accurate .
positive	( royal_canin diabetic ).
negative	he then in a very condescending tone says , " fine i will give you the $_000 .
positive	he got a shovel and shoveled my car out , and i was on my way .
positive	i look_forward to the next purchase .
negative	i didn ; t end up booking the package and decided to book the next_day .
positive	thank_you
neutral	furthermore , i found a squashed piece of chocolate ( at_least i hope it was chocolate !)
positive	the weather has_been mild since they arrived ; but i am confident before this winter is over i will have the right tool for what i need .
negative	you receive a lower price , but it comes with a customer service cost .
negative	i would be very careful in giving them any money !.
neutral	i ordered labels and they turned_out great .
positive	delighted !
negative	da_jeg åbner pakken bliver jeg selvfølgelig glad for alt det nye udstyr , men glæden bliver lynhurtigt afløst af_en frustration , da_jeg opdager en skade i den_ene ende af boardet .
positive	you should try it .
positive	i am so happy with the quality and speed of delivery .
neutral	the only problem was that my " deal " left off an airport tax that was almost the same amount as the cost of the entire booking .
positive	throughout the entire_process i had all my concerns , questions , etc answered in a clear description because i was not very well_versed on this process .
positive	great company , great prices , fast shipping .
negative	basically i probably would be reluctant to regularly shop with parts_geek .
positive	times on expected delivery date , great service
positive	the parts i ordered came the next_day as_promised .
negative	i have filed the necessary fraud paperwork with my credit_card company .
negative	the site has good stuff but i wouldn_'_t reccommend going some where else
neutral	it '_s unfortunate too because otherwise , my experience with the company was good .
neutral	!
positive	great service on wide_range of products .
negative	after two additional emails and two phone_calls ( which go through to a line where there '_s no ability to leave a message and nobody ever answers ), i got an_email_stating that " your item was delivered early , on the 00th of december ."
negative	contacted their customer service and they insist they shipped everything right !
neutral	the only_thing was that one of the pieces broke , i asume on the way here .
neutral	i was a little surprised when i did not receive the item i purchased after a week of waiting .
negative	så_er_det vist rimeligt tydeligt , selv for kundeambassadøren at nykredit ikke ønsker at leve op_til de løfter , garantier og ansvar de gav .
positive	i have a 0000_saab 000 spg turbo .
neutral	this was a surprise present for my husband and that surprise was ruined when he saw your logo on the back of the envelope and knew what it was .
positive	first_class service and top quality highley recomendable
positive	excellent service from order to delivery would recommend it to anybody
negative	on 00 / 00 / 0000 had lunch buffet , food was ask if everything was alright , i replied just ok .
neutral	meanwhile , payment had been taken up front .
positive	came within time scale boxed up , no damage etc .
negative	my first experience with frames_direct last_year was great , i told everyone about you and planned to be a customer for life .
negative	beware !!
positive	would recommend this company to any one .
negative	this is unacceptable !!
negative	then i find out this was not marriot and i could have contacted them to get the $_000 per_night rate .
negative	after over a dozen emails and phone_calls we had little to no response .
negative	they told me it might take awhile for the e_-_mail because of my internet service , but the reservation showed_up immediately and now i have to go through this all over again .
neutral	i suppose the elderly and infirmed are an easy touch because certian mobility aids have to be purchased no matter what the cost and these firms know it .
neutral	says they are prepackaged the way it states and they can change nothing even if it '_s the same price .
negative	my compensation was a voucher which merely covered the price difference_between the promo offer and a 0 . 0kg sack of protein .
positive	part came as_described !
negative	i would recommend that people thinking of using this website , find another .
negative	- and not be able to attend the event you bought tickets for on account of viagogo '_s terrible service ,
neutral	end_result good , but need to do better
positive	i have used travel_visa pro twice so_far when going to nigeria .
negative	we saw 0 cats inside but the litter_boxes were over full and they ' d started_using the floor .
positive	would definitely use this site again
negative	our family will not do_business this company any longer .
negative	purchased a $_00 psn_card .
neutral	i am willing to order more products , but at this stage i am reluctant to order again after delivery times which are far from reasonable .
neutral	will start making all reservations over the phone with hotel desired as one of last ones i used stated that i would have saved money by doing so .
neutral	i did not like the message that appeared when i ordered ( please be aware that it is not possible to change or cancel your order .
neutral	i want to be able to buy multiple cards all in the same name without having to fill_out the name and greeting individually .
positive	great - glasses arrived in a couple of days and are exactly as_promised .
negative	it is 0_weeks_later and still no card .
neutral	in fact some of airbnb_competitors , including well recognized_names such as tripadvisor , are essentially_scam_operations .
negative	since it does not have the yellow tab to remove , and the gray covering is hard to remove and when you do the ink comes out and leaks out over everything .
neutral	thanks .
neutral	i am very dissapointed that i have had to p [ ay £_00 to send my goods back the discription stated cream and it is a lemon colour , very poor experience
negative	i would never order from them again .
neutral	u did not offer aaa_discount .
neutral	again i activated it , tried it , it was declined .
neutral	although i wanted 0kg , the 0kg pack was out of stock .
positive	we had really quick turnover time , and the end_result was great .
positive	unfortunately , the weather got milder by the time i was able to use them .
neutral	and they will not take a passport as proof of identity .
neutral	they lose 0_stars for not having that common_sense .
positive	!
positive	it '_s an old ' 00 chevy with a good body but the plastics on the front were falling_apart , partsgeek to the rescue , for a little more than $_000 she is looking like new again .
negative	but when my order arrived , only the full price cases were included .
negative	i simply clicky - clicked the super convenient link graciously sent to my email , post a review , and wait to see what happens next .
positive	booking was incredibly fast ( less_than a minute ) and there '_s no booking fee !
positive	from an easy online purchase interface to clear email_updates to next_day delivery in the highlands all at competitive prices i am delighted .
positive	the service was very efficient . i made the order and the pram was delivered the next_day .
neutral	very pleasant company , nice to deal with but no show as of now with the goods --- probably the post_office / royal_mail / parcelforce
neutral	seriously . watch out for this because if you don_'_t , a tree limb will knock your head off .
negative	for us it is no more your service or frontier !!!
negative	when petflow finally sent the cat_food , i was sent one case of the correct prescription food and 0 cases of another prescription food that my cat couldn_'_t eat .
negative	i went in to get new living_room furniture and left absolutely upset .
positive	i usually recieve my order with in 0 - 0 days !
positive	when they sent me the proof , it looked great so i breathed a small sigh of relief , but was still a bit_worried until i saw the final_product .
negative	i clearly order my shoes 0 . 0 and they sent me an 0 but i never checked the invoice when i summited the order .
neutral	asked them to send it by usps which would have cost not more than $_00 .
negative	customer service is everything to me and the way i was treated on the phone was less_than satisfactory .
negative	after many emails and times that my emails were not answered although i sent to them everything they asked for .
positive	we were very pleased with the service that was provided .
positive	you have gotta subscribe to this site .
neutral	however the lunch was not authentic english faire as_advertized .
positive	i was amazed and pleased that the item was received so quickly !
neutral	could you have given me a tracking_#.
neutral	i received no response to inquiry ticket i opened and after finding phone_number on my credit_card statement there was never an answer and finally no response to phone message that i left .
negative	this is absolutely_ridiculous .
negative	this is simply not good enough , if you haven_'_t placed an order with them yet i would strongly_recommend not doing so .
neutral	my experience of skyscanner is that although the website works extremely well the prices quoted by the companies are never correct when you go to actually make a booking .
positive	a +
negative	the person i talked to on the phone said they had the glasses i wanted ( frames were red with leopard print on the side , dolce & gabbana brand .)
neutral	in fact , in my isme catalogue , the appliance was £_000 - nearly double , and £_00 delivery and no offer of removal of old_appliance , so all in all , and it is gorgeous , it was kind of worth it .
positive	i ordered some jeans from nygard , they fit amazing and look amazing .
positive	did not really need the rush but worked out okay .
positive	they fit great and really look cute on her .
neutral	!
neutral	i don_'_t know if that was my fault or if the website had a way of figuring_out i was thinking about reserving a room , but hesitated , and ended_up having to reserve the room at a higher rate .
negative	didn_'_t inform_me that they don_'_t have it stock .
negative	i recevied my package , they never fit . there was no phone_number to call .
neutral	local_supplier , with the stock i need and keen prices .
positive	have never had problems with poor quality or questionable practices when working with b_&_h over the years .
neutral	so , i was very frustrated when i received my shipping notification , assumed the food would arrive the next_day , and was left with no animal food several days_later .
neutral	overall service was fine , relatively easy to order online and delivery came well within the 00 day delivery period , unlike last time which was dead on the 00 day limit .
neutral	so some good , some not .
negative	it has now been 0 days and i have heard_nothing from h / r .
negative	true your product is great prices reasonable , but to refuse to accept and
negative	there are some others out there that you can call and speak to a live_person , i am going to use autoparts warehouse from now on .
neutral	i could have easily been mistaken for vegetable chow fun rather_than beef .
positive	i will never lug my clubs around again .
negative	hmmmm let_me see i paid $_00 . 00 for the shoes plus shipping ($ 0 ) then return shipping of $_00 and i get a $_00 credit .
positive	the price on this pair of vittoria corsa tyres made them un - missable .
negative	they finally agreed to refund my money a week_later , but they refuse to refund the shipping cost even_though it '_s 000_% their fault .
neutral	left in doorway blocking entrance to apartment complex .
negative	the price is the same as the pet_store and the shipping is free as i order two bags at once .
neutral	the reservation process was easy and efficient but i was not given the option to use my hilton_honors account information .
negative	this experience with partsgeek has_been very bad and has cost me three_weeks of lost time in getting the parts to repair my dangerous to drive vehicle .
neutral	my opinion is you need more protection than just a bag .
neutral	the big !
positive	would highly_recommend .
neutral	prompt service as far as your part being shipped and delivered !
negative	it has to reform , or die .
positive	i also had a choice of price_ranges and requested seats on the upper level which i got .
negative	worst online shopping_experience i have ever had and i will not be shopping here ever again
negative	when i called petflow . com to request a refund for the spoiled bag of food , the rep informed me that " the dog_food isn_'_t our responsibility sice we get it from the manufacturer ".
neutral	delta had already rebooked everything and all was well .
neutral	i feel 0st choice should at_least verify that parts exist and if they don_'_t the suppliers should have a negative rating for saying they did .
positive	i will recommend and reuse .
positive	speedy and extremely_helpful - would definitely recommend them
positive	tha ' ts what i call a good service .
negative	these_people have not clue to the meaning of customer service .
neutral	the invoice told me to pick_up at the train_station .
negative	after much run_around , i told the agent to cancel my reservation all together and i would work directly with the hotel .
neutral	i '_m not even too sure how i can get it to stay on the wall .
positive	tulen käyttämään myös jatkossa .
positive	very happy with the labels we ordered for our shower .
negative	here '_s what has me upset : i tried to return the glasses and no one would take responsibility for getting me an_rma or whatever the return_authorization is .
neutral	there is better out there , but you certainly have to pay for it .
positive	quick and good
positive	i ordered a pair of versace frames i live them .
negative	after about 0 days , my order was mysteriously canceled .
positive	lightning_fast delivery - they even let you choose if you want your package delivered by ups or fedex .
positive	recommend it :)
negative	these cans were not necessarily on the outer side of the case ; alot were right in the middle of the case with undamaged cans around the damaged ones .
neutral	after another 00_minutes , i was able to confirm my order .
positive	thank_you !
positive	working on a sheriff '_s special response team requires long hours and demanding training .
negative	live and learn !!
neutral	your representative was very courteous and explained i should have received a email_stating a stop order on the product and i had choice of refund or more product .
negative	vous vendez à_la sauvette des télécommandes et votre responsable et uniquement la sur_le papier et non physiquement
negative	you get to do that yourself .
negative	they sent me a duplicate key . meaning they already sold someone the key i received .
positive	i then received a text on my mobile that had all the details of my purchase and delivery date .
neutral	also still_awaiting £_00 cashback for purchasing 0 products .
negative	wonder_why ?
negative	first , i was not informed that i was not speaking to the hotel desk at the hampton_inn .
neutral	staff were polite but clearer instructions need to be given for pick ups .
neutral	i cannot_believe that an airfare can go down $_00 per_ticket and nothing can be done about it because it it 0 days_later !
neutral	first i ordered a mrs . claus costume - it was very ill - fitting .
positive	i '_m always pleased with the delivery times and quality of kit on offer .
negative	i still_haven_'_t received my refund .
neutral	beautifull costume but slow shipping , , very slow .
negative	ive used 0000_rpm a few_times and am very dissapointed with the service i recieved on this occassion , i did nt even get a call to say sorry but we have had a problem today and will not be able to deliver your package , if i had recieved good customer_service my view would be different but the seervice was very poor .
negative	i was not offered anything in the way of compensation , even when asked and it was always up to me to call to find out what was going on .
neutral	i receive a receipt automatically via_email about 0 minutes after i pass through the exit gate .
neutral	i had no problem doing this as we all make mistakes .

negative	i had a horrible experience with this seller .
negative	i live in an apartment complex and in dallas , tx where my 0 square miles averages over 000 robberies a year .
neutral	the large turning radius and oversized sight obstructing b pillar were constant annoyances .
positive	it arrived earlier_than was estimated too .
negative	> i had booked a trip through_expedia from ottawa to san_diego with [_external reference_].
neutral	we live in the countryside and the van_driver got totally lost !
negative	i requested overnight delivery , and even called the salesmen on the " 000 " number to confirm it would be shipped immediately .
neutral	my phone_calls are constantly dropped , the quality is poor and people to whom i am talking cannot hear me clearly .
neutral	i called rushordertees four separate times so i could pay for the shirts only to be able to leave a message for my consultant ( which was never returned with a call ).
positive	i shop_here whenever i get the chance and its like christmas every time !
neutral	i wish this had been made clear on the website or at_least some more clear guidance on which products suit which skin type .
positive	i would recommend using this company .

negative	she disconnected the call .
positive	i love my car anr have found it hard to get the parts i need for it .
positive	couldn_'_t ask for anything more
positive	he was helpful , well spoken , polite , and knowledgeable .
negative	as a result , i had to drive my clubs 00 miles to the nearest ups distribution_center and drop them off .
neutral	there are a many variaty of products , the prices is good , but the shipping method for another countrys need to be cheaper and faster .
neutral	i wish it was cheaper each_month .
positive	primo acquisto .
positive	packing and shipping was fast and efficient .
neutral	i reported it and am waiting for a replacement .
negative	extremely disappointed .

positive	professional and efficient drop_off and collection saved us missing our flight !
neutral	skin - care , makeup and contact_lenses are just crazily high .
positive	legalforce provided on a regular_basis .
negative	the woman at the desk was incredibly rude and forced us into purchasing insurance packages that we did not need just because we were young with the threat that she would charge my card to 0000 euro and hold the money if i did not buy the added insurance .
neutral	this required additional effort to cleanup .
positive	oh , and one thing i have wished for for years : please make an android_app !!
neutral	the first order i placed was rejected because the picture i uploaded was of my son - in -_law with a paint ball gun at his son '_s birthday_party .
neutral	the camera was class a which_meant it was a good price and it stated the camera was pristine with all parts but the box may be damaged .
neutral	but when i picked car up frontdesk had no_idea .
negative	where are my parts ?
neutral	goldstar is terrific for landing tickets at less_expensive prices .
negative	suddenly , they '_ve introduced new outrageous delivery charges with no_explanation , authoritatively informed their customers after the changes were introduced and customer_support refuses to provide any answers other than a pre_- set script .

positive	always great prices and particulary good for kids .
negative	i am un satisfaction their service .
neutral	we do not know what courier service is used so are unable to contact them to make delivery arrangements .
negative	if we had been on holiday , it would have been an invitation to burglars .
neutral	sigining up with an agency , it takes process and steps to find a job .
positive	never having heard of the site before we were a bit_skeptical but it worked out great , amazing deal for the car / location .
neutral	luckily , i got on the 0 : 00 am shuttle ( which arrived 00_minutes late ) and processed thru security with enough time to catch my flight . but someone strictly relying on the advertised " on demand " shuttle could miss a flight easily as a result .
neutral	i had to change all my plans and hotel reservations .
negative	they would not deliver to my po_box .

neutral	fast forward to my bank_statement of july_0th , and i now find - as feared - that i was in fact charged for sixteen playstation_network_cards [ each valued at 00 . 00_usd ], thus creating a deficit in my credit rating .

neutral	sucky support_team !!
neutral	however the flowers were not as expected and they were small in size to what i expected and paid for , hence me being disappointed as they were for a family_member , not value for money .
negative	i would not recomend selectspecs . com to my friends or family .
negative	i was promised my stuff would be delivered door to door in 00 to 00 days it is almost 00 days_later and i am still_waiting .
neutral	i am not so comfortable entering my credit_card info online , yet i had no other choice .
neutral	i contacted customer_services straight_away to provide the feedback .

neutral	once on my bed if i sit on it it creases really badly and it looks a mess .
positive	not a criticism , but a cheaper delivery option would have been welcomed , second class_post or whatever , but even at current rates the price + postage is still a winner .
neutral	what is not clear is that if you have an iphone that was once jailbroken / unlocked and the baseband is 00 . 00 . 00 , then apple will not let your phone be unlockedi , wish i was inform of the problems you can encounter , so i could change the base band before upgrading my phone to ios 0 . 0 . 0 which is very hard to change the base band or down grading from .

negative	honestly , just don_'_t use these_guys .
positive	good service at a good price .
positive	they stock a good range of products for quiet computing , at good prices , ship orders quickly & with reasonable delivery charges .

positive	the vehicle was brand_new and extremely ecomonic to run .
neutral	there must be another problem .
neutral	it was easy to place my re - order though .
negative	person that answered the phone is a novice when it comes to wine , but the worst part was that she was indifferent to the customer '_s needs .
negative	not good business !!!!!!!!!
neutral	tried it out for the first time and found it a little_confusing on how to use it but figured it out .
neutral	the second one was not : the parts were not in stock and nothing tells you that when you go in the website .
neutral	when new confirmation came through , it stated gatwick term 0 and gatwick term 0 , so once again , office sorted it out .
neutral	ok .

neutral	the hotel was fabulous but we were disappointed .
positive	it arrived quickly , and the price was great .
neutral	another highlight was when the zandvoort track director stopped in his 0000 ’_s alfa for a chat , as he too is a huge lotus enthusiast .
positive	the quality of the paper is fine and the photos look good .
positive	shipped quickly and was exactly as_advertised .
positive	the site is easy to use and it '_s incredibly easy to find a good place to stay because of the rating_system , which from my experience so_far , seems very accurate .
negative	i did this twice over a two week period .
neutral	hello !
negative	i booked two flights online and got only one confirmed and had to call and told there was a 00 - 0 / 0 wait time and after numerous more calls could not get any one to be of help and could not get a supervisor and finally needed to book directly though the airline .
neutral	product range is good as is the price ( esp when they run promotions ) however the delivery is often rubbish and the follow_up customer service is generally poor ( i '_ve had reason to call 0 times because an order hadn_'_t arrived and only once was it addressed in a way i considered appropriate )?
positive	excellent communication , prompt delivery and just started my dog on the green lipped mussel powder today which she ate no problem .
neutral	i have had a few issues with orders in the past that have not been so smooth , but have been resolved in a reasonable time frame .
neutral	bilder und bewertung sind nicht wahrheitsgetreu !!
neutral	the other items came in fine and were correct .
neutral	i wasted a lot of time .
neutral	the person_who answered the phone told me that i should call back in 0 hours , no explaination .
negative	the parts i did receive were damaged and inferior .
negative	the only bright spot is that i actually got the right parts .
negative	i could have bought some others elsewhere in a fraction of the time and it could have messed_up my plans .
positive	i would definitely fly again with you all .
negative	go shop amazon at_least they are more honest and reliable !
neutral	i received one email_stating that the order has_been placed and that they would ship it very quickly but that was it .

neutral	i had been to four places prior to you guys and they all did not work either .
positive	i love the fact that sprayology is homeopathic solutions to health .

neutral	after e_bay acknowledging the order nothing heard for three_days when a " your order has_been despatched " e_mail arrived .
negative	in order to try and get some benefit from their promotion i had to split my order in two , which_meant i then had to pay delivery charges twice and lose the discount on half of my order .
negative	partsgeek has a bad return_policy and are careless upon inspect parts before shipping them .
negative	i would never recommend this company .
neutral	would i use servicing stop again ?
positive	a major factor is the continuing cost of items such as testing strips which are very reasonably_priced .
positive	i started_using a made in the usa cobra and a classic shaving brush about 0 years_ago .
neutral	???
positive	i found xile on the web , whilst_searching for a coat that i couldn_'_t find anywhere .

positive	highly_recommended !
positive	i love pet_flow !
neutral	older hotel needs updated but this is the only bad_experience in 0 stays here .
positive	between myself and friends , we ordered 000 '_s of custom kits ( for century rides and other fun bike outings ) and are very happy with the product and services .
negative	this website is a phishing website
negative	!
positive	i am amazed .
negative	i ordered an eheim 0000 canister filter from the website directly , though they also fill orders on amazon and ebay .
negative	mind you we are new to this and don ’ t know much about brands , measurements and such .
neutral	terrible business .
neutral	the quick response i received indicated
neutral	taking part of the order as i was tied to a weekly route which did not allow me to choose a convenient day for delivery .
negative	when we went to pick_up our car , they wanted to charge us a $ 0 , 000 security deposit which they said they would refund in 00 days !
negative	the courier contacted me the next_day to say the mattress had been delivered to them damaged so i wouldn_'_t receive it that day , and they would let bedworld know .
neutral	if you want the name of my pet '_s veterinarian , look at that prescription yourself .
negative	it was in the boot .
positive	thank_you for an enjoyable_experience
neutral	good golly is the rate such a secret ?
negative	there stuff is cheap , but it is cheap quality and not worth the hassle !
positive	very informative with information with regards to tyres , thanks again .
positive	later i realized that by just repairing my current phone i would not have to go through the hassle of moving all my important data between devices , and i would likely have lost most of it since my screen was completely unusable .
neutral	the lady booking the package kept confusing our information after multiple_attempts of repeating our information .
negative	if you take offense and get defensive , you ' re missing ( yet another ) opportunity to get in front of a problem .
neutral	there was so much we missed .
neutral	i don_'_t recall seeing anything about when the tour ended on the brochure .
negative	zum glück gibt_es auch andere möglichkeiten um an flüge und hotels zu gelangen .
neutral	so i waited a total of 0 months to receive my make - ups , but in addition they gave_me more points .
positive	do not_hesitate to make your purchases from petflow .
positive	that '_s my plan
positive	i had my money back in no time .
neutral	then i had to repeat the same prfocess over again and listen to the same song for another hour before a rep .
negative	was charged £_00 . 00 to return and had to wait in 0 - 0 !!
neutral	i bought a mountain_equipment fleece which was of very poor standard for nearly_£_00 , but i returned it with the prepaid addressed label which was a great way to ensure the correct returns_procedure .
neutral	i '_ll have to dispute and instead of refunding my money to my credit_card they will give me store credit which is not acceptable
negative	apparently delivery . com " forgot " to send everyone '_s order to that restaurant and because they were incompetent , my order was severely delayed .
negative	look don_'_t get staff from here they show you one price and charge other more_expensive you wont get any response from them
neutral	i end up using seamless or grubhub even_though i may start out first at delivery . com for this reason .
neutral	the only issue i had was the sales_rep handling my order emailed me using the wrong name twice with two different names .
positive	there were absolutely no inconveniences and i will be able to take my trip as scheduled .
negative	after selecting a room and the amount of nights i was going to stay i was provided with a total dollar_amount and tax that would be charged to my card .
neutral	second advice is to hire more people to assist with calls so it limits the wait because 00 minute wait with no luck of getting through is extreme .
neutral	they are awful , get_rid .
neutral	also , the website doesn_'_t let_me make half and half pizzas [ although that might be the pizza place i use , nyc pizza factory ]
positive	ordered the tyres on the thursday and got a call from the fitting_centre to tell me that i can have them fitted on the friday_morning if i wanted , i was in and out in 00_mins .
negative	communication is horrible and if you get some unsatisfied customers b * uj ** will delete your account out of nowhere what the hell .
neutral	normally i would have sent something like this back but i needed it for my inspection so i had no time .
neutral	the part also arrived in a short_amount of time .
positive	extremely useful if you don_'_t want to lug_heavy_luggage on a plane or pay extortionate fees for excess baggage .
neutral	we had to use this car for two_days until we could get to a larger dealer and exchange it for the car that we reserved .
positive	great service and value .
neutral	i was very pleased with the whole service , but dissapointed that the payment i received was nearly_£_00 less_than promised !
neutral	when i went to the website to actually book , it went from the first section where you put in all of your information , to the second part , when you put in your credit_card information , then it stopped completely !!!
neutral	so instead of feeling that they came to my aid , i was penalized for trying to protect myself from a scammer .
negative	meanwhile i have no lock on the tank and we have had oil thefts in our village .
positive	the shipping was super quick !
neutral	you sell great products at great prices but just need to go that extra_mile to avoid_disappointment .
neutral	i liked the site , it worked fine .

positive	i was ready to throw my hands up & say " forget it ".
neutral	a piece of the signal_light was broke off , but i was able to switch it out with the old one that was on my other side_mirror .
neutral	i think that this product should not be sold until this problem is resolved .
positive	great site - easy to use and fabulous prices
negative	your link to this review also does not work .
negative	000_% percent of the time ive have got nothing but great extremely fast service but this last order will be my last , the shipping which normally took 0 day ( literally ) took almost 00 days and a very important product for my pets skin was out of stock all the sudden 0 days after my order so i did not get that .
neutral	the only problem i have with merchadise , is my shirt has a large faded spot on nose of dog . that was the 0xx , wife '_s shirt was perfect .
positive	you '_ll like them !
negative	now i am stuck_paying return shipping and still do not have the right part i needed .
positive	mikki and the staff went out of their way to ensure my complete_satisfaction . honestly , i could not ask for better customer_service !
positive	i planed this vac with bookit with in a hour and if i went though a travel_agent it would had took two_days .
negative	i '_m beginning to doubt whether i even have authentic oliver peoples glasses , considering this company hasn_'_t bothered responding to my last few emails , which are regarding their offer to give me a $_00 credit on my purchase if i reviewed their company here and at another site .
neutral	that was on friday .
negative	thomas gillette
positive	if that '_s not enough , i recently bought a fuji x00 just for snaps thru b_&_h , don_'_t always need the 0d .

negative	han forlod herefter lejligheden med gasmåleren og på_vej ud_af døren forklarede han , at min_søn nu kunne kontakte en vvs installatør , der kunne montere en_ny gashane og en_ny måler ??
neutral	delivery is very good .
neutral	capsule machine not bad , but empty capsules bought at same time are of slightly varying widths , so many fall straight out of the machine .
positive	the price was right for a brand and vintage that i could not find in the northeast except at this store .
neutral	emailed cs upon_receipt of my order expressing my displeasure .
positive	they offered to take a down payment for the purpose of ordering the chairs for manufacture and then were to hold them in their warehouse until i was ready to take possession .

positive	i have used allbeauty several_times now .
negative	and although everyone i spoke with was very courteous and helpful , it took literal hours to track down my reservation because it was lost in some_sort of travelocity / expedia limbo .
negative	i panicked of course .
negative	i am puzzled as to how they are still in business . then again maybe it is because of people like me who need a part and can get it no other way . first you have to dig thru their website to find a number to call them .( note that you are trying to place an order or in my recent case , trying to get information before returning a failed part ). does that make_sense ?
negative	they sent me the wrong part , and now i have no part .
positive	i was then called to arrange next_day delivery and the customer_service adviser was knowledgable , extremely_helpful and charming , she also told me about the care plan , in a way that was not pushy , but explanatory . the benefits were obvious and it was set_up with ease .
negative	congrats , mobilitypass , doing good !
neutral	they look nothing like the picture and they are not straight on my face !!
negative	i am now in the process of trying to ship it back and get a refund and reimbursement for shipping .

positive	happy with the product .
negative	ordered a pair of sunglasses and they arrived damaged .
neutral	i liked the ease of purchasing the gift_card but on one page in the process it indicated that shipping would be free with the choice i made .
positive	he told me they were of good quality and well made and not a problem to install .
positive	this was the first time ordering from this company .
neutral	this is bordering on the " it '_s not worth the effort ", unless you ' re selling relatively large numbers .
neutral	will not order from them again .
negative	i think i have had a lucky esape , there are some really excellent online_retailers out there for white_goods - this lot is not one of them .
negative	i am a consumer with a paypal and buymelater account ( they solicited me for ) and both have been nightmares !
negative	i immediately called customer_service , received a voicemail , left my name , number and order number and have not heard from them yet , february_00th @ 0 : 00_pm .

neutral	boots fully respiked and much_better in the current soggy pitches we are playing on .
negative	i went on the bookit . com site a few minuets later and noticed that both of the duplicate trips were still confirmed .
neutral	excellent service , the bean_bag arrived very promptly and i was kept well informed of progress of order .
negative	the computer forwards your order to a parts distributer but there is no one minding the office .
neutral	so it '_s up to you . start protecting those cans with packing_material or i am going to become an ex - customer .
neutral	due to apparent sporadic it issues could not get web_page to select item and had to make several_attempts at placing order and send couple of emails to customer_services / info but eventually the website would allow me to place the order and go to the basket and complete order .
positive	i would definately recommend them to anyone .
neutral	this has_been a huge disappointment to the kids .
negative	i was slightly disgruntled to see they use yodel , however , on this occasion , yodel had actually managed to deliver my goods .
positive	really good service , if anything is wrong it is put right immediately with no_fuss .
positive	on arrival at the nominated_garage i discovered that they had the correct details of my booking and the tyres were fitted in the time specified .
neutral	a great bet for a budget night .
negative	der_står fire ekspedienter ved kasserne og_ingen kunder ud over mig .
neutral	however the hard parts i have ordered have been packaged so well they could be air dropped and not be damaged !
negative	i ordered a book for class but it was not delivered .
neutral	what a joke .
neutral	not positive it '_s was supposed to b marked next_day saturday delivery but they messed_up yet again n i didn_'_t get it until monday .
positive	i would definitely order parts again through parts_geek .
neutral	then a delivery message to say the items to be delivered on the monday , 00nd .
neutral	it wasn_'_t the end of the world but i would have appreciated an_email a little_bit earlier on saturday_morning or friday_afternoon which would have given sufficient time for a new order to be processed .
positive	would recommend this company to anyone .
negative	much to my surprise .
neutral	most_likely , hertz and others find it easy to pluck a few extra euros or dollars from out of country customers .
neutral	i was told very nonchalantly that it would take 0 to 00 days .
positive	some day i must visit their new_york store .
positive	super quick turn round very very satisfied customer .

negative	you also stated to me that email communication with the insurer would be possible .
positive	the prices are amazing
neutral	very disappointed - did all the stops - but did not notify passengers when a stop was coming up .
negative	i did actually get two responses the first time i asked questions , but i '_ve asked 0 questions since then & has not been answered yet !
negative	also did i mention that their phone # disconects you after 00_minutes even if you are trying to place an order .
negative	they said that it is my fault because i didn_'_t specify plain lenses .
positive	the rite part ,,, super_fast shipping , ordered late 0 days before_thanksgiving got it the day after thanksgiving , fed_ex did not ship on that day . will buy from again !!
negative	he , in no uncertain terms , stated that the date could not be changed under any circumstances as the items were already loaded on the van ( why , as the delivery wasn_'_t for another couple of days ?).
positive	would recommend to anyone
neutral	after the 0rd time i removed the sign the magents stayed on the car .
negative	anyway , i thought all was well until i had my bridesmaids round to try the dresses on and one of them ( light green chiffon ) had a large blue biro mark down the back !
neutral	also , there was an unannounced substitution that i had to sort out .

negative	they did not send any email to inform him & he is still stuck there !
negative	i was told that i needed to take out additional insurance and also advised to pay for my fuel up front to avoid delays when returning the car , what i was not told was that the insurance was actually a ' serenity pack ' ( cost 000_euros ) and that there was a re - fuelling charge .
negative	thank_you for wasting my time and money .
neutral	if the pieces had been from the same picture print and matched , the final_outcome would have been very impressive .
positive	tires installed in a timely_manner but the only issue was an_additional_charge for alignment of the back tires . not really necessary in my opinion but i agreed to it .
neutral	it was packaged in an old box from a different product - could have been much_better presented .
neutral	delivery was super quick and efficient , however the item had been crammed into a box which was too small resulting in the product packaging being badly_damaged .
neutral	i have travel_agent experience , but now retired , so i am knowledgeable about features , benefits , pricing , and good customer_service .
positive	like i said no problem
positive	the simplicity is remarkable , plus having 00 speed_dial numbers that take you directly to your friends and family is fantastic .

positive	have great specialist translating in the languages we requesting .
negative	he told me yes .

positive	easy to use website , good price , fast delivery .
neutral	i don_'_t really like stg return exchange policy .
negative	agent : and then that would just leave the one last flight for the other adult , whenever they ' re ready to book .
neutral	we got to the hotel around 0 on a friday_evening .
neutral	the return_authorization_number should be created automatically with the original order ( for those with a core_return ) and sent with the order or shipment .

neutral	with 0 small_children and a central rome departure for the beach in terracina , it made sense to rent in rome as_opposed to the airport .
neutral	had a response from boohoo stating that they replied to my twitter message , but can i just point out that i had to sign_up to twitter for the sole purpose of getting in touch with boohoo in the first place as my email message was ignored !!!
negative	i ordered a scarf and it is so below standard quality that i don_'_t even know what i will do with it .

neutral	i made two purchases from boohoo howver not happy with the quality so returned them both . i have waited nearly two_weeks to be notified of boohoo receiving them back so i can have the money back in my bank £_00 . however 00 days returns_policy is clearly not working for people who are on low incomes and have no further cash to spend on xmas_presents whilst waiting for returns money .

neutral	there are a few hiccups i '_ve experienced including the difficulty of returning unused tickets , having to be present ( to show the credit_card used to make the purchase ) to get my students on board , and some guides are much_better_than others ( one guide told students that he was hungover and didn_'_t really feel_like talking ).
neutral	the site itself was easy to use and good eas of use , but when it came to paying had so many difficulties , and just would not accept my credit_card and kept saying payment failed .
positive	delivery is superspeedy and they have a very good postage policy - you only have to spend £_00 to get free delivery .
neutral	0 .

positive	what more can you ask for ?
neutral	the service was very speedy on delivering the part however it was the wrong part and the hassle im getting just to return the part is ridiculous i gave the confirmation # and then you ask me to take pictures of the box and part then you want me to forward you accopy of the original email

neutral	travelocity let the ball drop on this trip .
neutral	i assume the product is not in this condition when it leaves the warehouse , so i think the deliveries need to be better packed or handled with care during shipping .
negative	not one of them opened after i received them , cut the stems , put in a vase with water and the plant food they provide , and took the webbing off the flowers that protects them during shipment .
negative	she did not apologize and put the phone down while i was talking .

neutral	tip - for the holiday_inn crystal city , alamo rental_car is about 00 meters away from the holiday_inn - so an_alternative if the hotel pickup is as bad as it was for us .
neutral	when i have questions_regarding my purchases being shipped .
negative	should have done my homework and read the reviews before ordering anything from these_guys .
neutral	so , i waited with bated breath . and the trees finally turned_up at the very last_minute to be within the stated delivery period .
neutral	i say this because both packing boxes had holes in , and the guitars hard case also had a corresponding hole in it . thankfully , the guitar was saved from damage .
negative	i have found everything i wanted and was going to order from them through amazon and ebay for less money and gotten everything in a timely_manner as well as shipping always is fast .
negative	i only received one of the three items i purchased .

negative	when i received the cancellation notice , it stated a credit would be issued within 00_hours but may not show up on my account for 00 days .

neutral	i ordered a bedside_cabinet with free delivery , then an_hour later decided to order a dining_table , which i paid £_00 delivery . the latter was delivered within a week on the 0nd august , but the ' free delivery ' one has still to be delivered - scheduled for this friday - 0_weeks_later .
negative	a few_days_later i contacted the hotel , and they let us know that our hotel room was not " all_inclusive ."
negative	i was told they never change delivery times , but that i could cancel for a sum of £_00 .
neutral	i had to email them and then call because i really wanted the item and not a refund !
positive	i have been working with the holbi group for 00 + years .
positive	great prices and timely shipping .
neutral	absolutely horrific customer service , good products and reasonably fast delivery . tried to get in touch with the company for three_days with little result , my emails with questions on placed order got answered long after the products were delivered . still the products are all right and represent great value for money
positive	while researching price for new_tires for my suv i spoke with quite a few places .
negative	so i had to send him out to the shop to buy another waste ( wasting more time ) and all i was offered by general_manager was a £_00 refund .
positive	starting from the easily manageable website , the great quality of the parts , and finally the promptness of the shipping , eeuroparts . com does it all of it just right .
positive	so this order was for my new pet .
negative	i am very disappointed in the services and the poor functioning of their online booking system !
negative	response :
neutral	i began calling and writing emails to find out the status on friday when it did not arrive and i had no way of tracking its status .

negative	$_000 worth of items were stolen .
positive	petflow processed and shipped my order promptly and sent the tracking_information .
positive	ordering was easy and fast !
negative	i tried to contact them to correct it but they don_'_t answer .
positive	extremely efficient and effectiv

neutral	i also wanted to have my wife as a second driver , in my agreement , it stated that this would cost 00 euros , but the agent had stated that the cost had just gone up to 00 euros .
neutral	ive made a couple of different orders and have been pleased .
neutral	only problem is that one issue was a big one .
negative	!
positive	i would definitely rent from this company again
negative	i have read and agree to the terms and conditions :
neutral	am not amused to have to pay so much for an extra day on existing policy .
positive	every time i order from b_&_h everything is correct and shipping / packaging is always first rate .

positive	thank_you north_shore commercial_door !
positive	!
negative	i called and spoke with an actual westin hotel employee who stated that i most_likely would have not gotten the two beds because it was a holiday_weekend .
positive	second , the customer_service people are really great in answering_questions and directing you and third , i always get my visas approved and on time .
neutral	i '_m hoping that my order will be completed and i will receive all of my other parts within a timely_manner .
positive	third , they promptly emailed the tracking_information .
positive	for anyone_who has ever lost their golf_bag or had it show up late , and never wants to worry_about that again - this is the perfect solution .
negative	in 0 days i recieved only one pair of the shoes and a reciept stating that the other two_pairs of shoes were not shipped yet .
negative	* dozens of calls to better_bathrooms , no joy , plenty of fobbing off , and no callback from manager or supervisor when requested .
neutral	ordered parts on saturday , august 0 , 0000 .
positive	after using my usual hotel for the past 0 years arranging transfers which included mini_bus drop offs at various hotels i did some research and came_across suntransfers offering a far better rate but also in a private cab for our personal use , both journeys to and from the airport were first_class and when we arrange our flights for next year i will_certainly book with suntransfers again .
negative	take them off your fav '_s for they will not respond to questions until you send scathing e_-_mails .
neutral	cancelled that scrip .
negative	game that i want at a reasonable time .
neutral	i am a size 0 and end up having to buy 0 , making it fit really big on me .

positive	exchanged replaced or refunded instantly no_hesitation .
neutral	ordering from springer through their web_site was a snap however i am still_waiting for the product to be delivered to my house .
neutral	there was no delivery date given until after purchase , which_meant if the dates they offered were not convenient , it was tough .
positive	i got several samples which were sent quickly .
positive	all perfect i received my code in 0 min !
neutral	cxhose a villa big enough for the 0 of us but only wanted 0 flights as the older children
neutral	what gives ??

negative	they said one was sent , but never received a new tracking_number or order information .
negative	and it said we have to wait 00 min .
neutral	showed_up at the airport , explained what happened and the very nice us_airways woman ( carol ) said no problem .
neutral	after i hassled them for over a month for " the code " i got on line and of course there was no weeks listed for 000 !!
negative	!
negative	booked 0 $_000 return trips dallas to houston thru_travelocity .
positive	i was really happy with the price , the quaity and the quick response and have no_hesitation in recommending them .
positive	good service and product
neutral	i correctly ordered two parts from the website .
neutral	well , the customer_service was iffy .
neutral	everything was okay except for the struts they where for the front not the back .
positive	but true it is !
negative	let '_s summarize : 0 ) expecting its customers to remember to cancel every six_months ; 0 ) not providing so much as an_email reminding that auto renew is about to occur ; 0 ) refusing to partially refund for the auto_renewed amount .
negative	this order was a huge_disappointment seeing as the shipping took a while too .
positive	i will_definitely recommend to all my friends .
positive	so if you need what 0xpower has there is no reason to shop any further .
positive	the bed and bedside_tables are greatr my daughter is very happy with it .
positive	anyway i found identity_guard and its been awesome .
positive	i did a lot of research before selecting to purchase a high - priced medication for my pet .
positive	the product looks lovely , very well_packaged and presented , looks_like a high end product .
negative	nothing happened since then i called the following_day and was told the flight portion of the trip can '_t be confirmed , we will call you in a little_bit after checking with the airlines .
negative	the hotel bent_over backwards to correct the problem but was still down the street for one night since they were at capacity .
negative	ordered brake_pads on 0 / 00 / 00 .
positive	we found the parts we needed easily on the site , the price was low and we had delivery in two_days .
positive	i had it in three_days .
positive	and , you can compare the prices of every place recommended .
negative	this happened on another occasion when i called .
positive	i was thrilled with the labels and tags we ordered from myown labels . com .
positive	:)
positive	!
negative	did you really think that attitude and treatment would sit well with a paying customer ???
positive	!
neutral	when we got to our room we discovered it was 0 beds instead of a king as we had requested .
positive	they are rarely out of stock .
neutral	ordered my d000 on line and was told to supply proof of address and then was told there was a problem with my cc .
neutral	why worry when your clubs are still in your office a 0 : 00_pm and you close at 0 : 00 and shipsticks tells you between_0am and 0pm for pickup .
positive	great value - have been using you for over a year and will certainly carry on .
negative	plus they do their best to " upsell " you constantly .
positive	reasonable prices and fast shipping make this a good deal .
negative	an_email was sent to me confirming the booking for that amount and the dates i wanted .
positive	first time i ordered glasses online , my husband enjoys his glasses and we saved money !
negative	does that make_sense to anyone ?
positive	when i told them that i only wanted one floor , i was told that the money for the second floor would be returned to me . it was !
negative	arrived first thing on day 0 , expected the car to be available .
negative	nothing is clear in your statement balance online and if you call credits , they are just rude .
positive	core_return was process and my card credited within 0 days of receipt of parts .
neutral	discount achieved and very prompt delivery made .
neutral	only about 0 / 0 of the contents were whole .
negative	in fact i cant get a response at all .
positive	especially when most companies can only promise within 0 - 0_weeks at the earliest .
positive	always my go to site as they provide free shipping over £_00 and fast delivery
negative	discounts / promotions / gift_certificates
negative	so i finally get my server back after a week ( not being_able to test my code as well ) and i proceed to demand a free month due to it being on their end this all happened .
positive	so_far , everything b_&_h has recommended for me has_been a perfect fit for my needs and experience level .
neutral	hade varit trevligt om chokladen blev skickad med !
positive	part fit right just as_described would use this company again
negative	i booked through easytobook and it sure was easy to book a hotel , howerver ; when i realized that a mistake was made on the dates on my part , i call the number that is on the confirmation_email and it saidthat they where close .
negative	i got the runaround for days .
negative	each time i call in i '_m told my case has_been closed and i have to initiative another complaint .
negative	such a scam , never using this site again !
positive	having lent my kilt to my brother for the afternoon ceremony , i was left with a dilemma - what can i wear .
neutral	i don_'_t think the people there no how to read english and or just don_'_t give a crap and they could not even give me an answer to my question it all .
negative	it would have worked if i had gotten my order in the first place .
negative	the part advertised did not fit my vehicle .
neutral	i emailed new_york dress , but of course they couldn_'_t do anything about it .
neutral	i specifically rented from autoeurope because the site offered a decent price for a mercedes car ( or similar model ) at palermo airport .
neutral	you guys have been in business a long time and i hope you guys look at this review and improve .
neutral	so , i contacted customer service via_e_-_mail to ask if i could choose a color , and their response didn_'_t help at all !
negative	frankly , i wouldn_'_t do_business with them again .
positive	that type of flexibility and help was very refreshing .
negative	this is not how you handle unhappy_customers .
positive	i use this company all the time .
negative	( lie # 0 ). you took $_000 of my debit_card .
neutral	it took a very long time for delivery .
neutral	!
positive	immediate_confirmation of your reservation at a price which is hard to believe .
negative	we have called with no answer .
negative	i don_'_t know how they have made it this long .
neutral	wasn_'_t told that the table cannot be delivered on saturday as courier doesn_'_t do saturdays and the extra i paid for delivery is only for delivering the bin on saturday .
neutral	but we had to wait 00_minutes for a bus to pick us up when we left the air and space museum .
positive	the web_site was weasy to use and delivery was prompt .
negative	ordered a package of radio_knobs for my 00 - yr_old daughters first vehicle since she had a couple missing .
negative	after an_hour and a half of speaking to customer service , and them calling the hotel saying it was there fault .
neutral	my order appeared not to be processed .
positive	it was very simple to request the type of room , date , and cost the was very efficient too .
positive	i would definitely recommend this company .
positive	have been looking for a fireman_sam wheely bag for ages .
negative	reservation #_000000000 , dated may 0 , 0000 .
positive	a euperb way to get tires .
negative	the only_reason i initially ordered from petflow was due to a coupon offer .
negative	i will not use rentalcars . com again for this reason .
positive	these three things are very important to me in a smaller business and this is what will keep me as a repeat_customer .
neutral	i absolutely love that quality of the campus .
positive	also , i have dealt_with the company directly and they have a top_notch staff .
positive	it is not everyday that you feel the need to purchase 000 ping_pong balls for your sons college project .
negative	as big as travelocity is , i would think there customer service for these kinds of issues would be much_better and less_stressful to resolve
neutral	i will use this site again as i could not get this toy in this country and i was pleased with toy and also received good customer_service via_e_mail
positive	the web_site is very easy to use and the order was placed and paying with paypal is supereasy .
neutral	the returns process would have required me to stay in all day awaiting a courier , which i wasnt happy to do , so to their credit , the staff arranged for a partial_refund , and i kept the lower spec item .
neutral	a very cheap bag but i didnt expect it to break in the first 0 minutes .
positive	quick and easy quote .
neutral	the colours and text are fine for a budget jersey .
positive	their service has always been first_class
positive	i cannot_praise this company highly_enough - they are simply awesome , and i will_definitely be ordering more items from them in the future .
neutral	hello .
negative	just don_'_t feel they were being completely honest with me .
negative	it was never answered .
negative	what a waste of a day , currys were supposed to deliver a fridge_freezer to day betwwen 0 . 00 and 00 ; 00 .
neutral	you would think they would have an inspection team .
neutral	i also hope they make it easier to speak with a real_person .
neutral	so the stuffed toy that came in the july box is suitable for a teacup size dog and the lint roller was something i could have lived without also as i '_m sure anyone already owning pets has a couple of these lying_around and the retail price was about $ 0 for that , i believe .
negative	it did had very little white stuff on it when i got it back .
neutral	so , overall great prices but you may be missing some products .
positive	initially made my reservation , them contacted the company and the attendants were very helpful in the planning and logistics of my move .
neutral	paypal already has anti_- fraud measurements in place , and i '_m pretty sure it is illegal to demand personal identity information before giving you the product you already paid for .
negative	yep !
positive	needless to say , i am very pleased .
positive	great and friendly staff
negative	i purchased a pair of oakley off shoot for £_000 from blaze .
neutral	they didn_'_t arrive in time .
positive	i love petflow . com and especially love the discounted prices !!!
negative	i felt_compelled to verify his promise the following_day and discovered that the raddisson is actually a 00 minute drive from the clinic and has no shuttle .
negative	this company has a whole range of delaying tactics including offering discounts for dresses that do not fit .
positive	the part arrived within the promised time and there were no_problems whatever .
negative	everything for my parents was prepaid , markers , plots , vaults , and all .
negative	i '_m sorry to say that i cannot recommend petflow because of their repeated errors .
positive	i was even able to use me flex spending for the entire amount .
positive	thought the pricing wsa a little too high versus some of the foreign competition that pushes these .
neutral	?
negative	i also asked if they were hilton and - yep !
negative	half an_hour later someone arrived to take my car .
neutral	had to call them to find one that we could go to .
negative	we will not make that mistake again
neutral	i placed a order for 00 dollars and some odd cents , after shipping was added it totaled out at 00 dollars and some odd cents .
negative	of course what i booked wasn_'_t available .
positive	thank_you for your prompt and efficient service i will be using you in the future
negative	do not waste your time or money on this website !
negative	i agree to receive it , seeing as how that was the only one they ordered ( though the website was still showing it as " in - stock ", which i told her she might want to change , she agreed ), on the condition that they get it in the mail that day , and if there '_s anything wrong with it , they '_ll pay return shipping and give me a refund no questions_asked .
neutral	i declined and could not get any sense from europcar so had a tense week not sure if i was insured or not !
positive	i was surprised how quickly the item arrived .
neutral	i rang to confirm what time am or pm and was told it would be part of the first load , so early am .
neutral	i was really pleased to find a great price on thermarest mats , pillows and a jacket .
neutral	but the frames were sent to my place in california where i will not return for several months .
negative	customer service only available m - f called credit_card company , to get info that merchant cancelled the order .
positive	everyone was very friendly and it did not cost me a fortune .
positive	kan_kun anbefales .
positive	thank_you gak !
positive	i have been purchasing camera_equipment from b_&_h for several_years_now and i have always received equipment in new , excellent condition , as_advertised .
positive	we ' re delighted with our oak_furnitureland media unit .
neutral	i have now managed to converse with customer_services , i was issued a refund for the gaskit that wasn_'_t fixed and offered a goodwill_gesture to compensate me for my loss of time .
neutral	but , i '_ll ask for a new feature - for a specific date search , you should have a rss feeds or email feeds for flight offers for a specific travel segment .
neutral	two were great .
neutral	the digit collection while dialing does not match a normal telephone :
positive	seating has always been excellent .
positive	on feb 00 , the daily " deal " site informed the item was sold out and i could not purchase until may .
positive	i love it !
positive	i will_definitely be shopping some more
neutral	you were out . will try and deliver next working day .'
negative	i '_ll never recommend this site but will tell others to stay away !
positive	the service was second to none and the perfect_condition boots arrived the very next_day .
neutral	efficient , had to change a different meet date , no problem .
positive	i can '_t believe_how awesome this is .
negative	i need to get to locker by myself and it '_s too far .
neutral	i arrived quite early in the morning at the dollar branch and had to wait 00_minutes ( no exaggeration !
negative	the only_thing that would change in price is the flight .
negative	my usual hotels that i stayed in were booked due to the president visiting town after a tornado hit a nearby city .
negative	your database is not accurate for older_cars .
negative	i could not recommend them ( the plumber states he knows other_companies but this results in spending more money than originally_planned , which is unhelpful )
negative	i entered it but it never applied to the total ?????
neutral	probably will order from this place as a last_resort next time , as there are plenty of competitiors .
positive	i '_m over the moon with my new family holiday book from jessops .
positive	can find accommodations anywhere for individual or family trips .
neutral	i can pay a little more locally and be assured the vacuum_seal hasn_'_t been jeopardized .
negative	we have an event and need guaranteed delivery and attention to detail .
negative	they said that there was no note written and that there was nothing that they could do about it .
neutral	fortunately , learning from before , i chose four different frames and had to wait for the company to contact the manufacturer to confirm they carried what i needed .
positive	workoutshop holder_hvad_de_lover .
neutral	i booked with bookit . com before and was very pleased .
neutral	everyone scrambled and then sat back down to waited for him to come_back out from wherever he was .
negative	i have traveled many_times and used lots of travel sites . never have i felt inclined to post a glowing review upon returning home .
negative	i am formally working on a complaint to the better business_bureau .
negative	and again , it doesn_'_t fit .
neutral	also was surprised they arrived without bags considering the cost
neutral	sometimes there '_s been careless attention to personalizations of the products ; for instance , an album i recently ordered that i personalized on the front cover came sloppily centered , really ruining the look of the piece .
negative	do not buy from this website unless you expect to be disappointed .
neutral	delivery of rest of items delayed by 0_weeks .
negative	first order was fine .
neutral	twice i have called with queries on my account and each time , they claimed i did not have an account with them .
neutral	!
positive	next_day delivery and ordered late_afternoon .
neutral	do i return the one not working , do i find replacement batteries on my own , your shipping_charges make me hisitate to order them through you because a . 00 batteries could end up costing me
negative	they emailed me back and said they had sent a tree with fungus and we should treat it immediately or the diseases could spread to other plants in our beautiful landscaped yard and gardens .

neutral	he solved the program in a matters of minutes and calmed me down .
neutral	sincerely mrs . carla coromilas
neutral	the only real " con " to my stay was the hot_water .
neutral	i filled this out on the order and had asked for driver to call me prior to delivery but they were completely_ignored .
neutral	0 screws loose at back support crome trims were not stuck down at joint and didn_'_t meet which made them sharp for little fingers to be cut .
neutral	unfortunately , the turnaround is not very convenient .
negative	think before you buy from them .
negative	after i got through the next_morning they said the branch is closed and that i need to wait_until 0am to see if i could get a car or not .
positive	charity asked just the right questions to get the exact size and location of the storage_unit that i needed .
positive	retailer was madhouse on old kent road , london .
negative	james_north : what about the pop_up list that does not list this hotel .
positive	i ordered on a friday_afternoon and could have had them on the monday but it suited me to have the delivery on the thursday - still pretty quick .

neutral	orders # 00 -_00000000 and 00 -_00000000
positive	one feature i especially_liked was the map feature which showed all the different hostels , and their distance to each other and the various sites of a city .
positive	would recommend this company to anyone

negative	i wasn_'_t too bothered as i recognise that accidents happen and it looked as if it has_been dropped in transit as the corner of the packaging was dented .
neutral	my girlfriend is everything to me , i just wished they had thought the same .
neutral	we had to pay an_additional full day rental .
negative	the original resort contacted me personally and told me that they are not for sale , nor have they been sold -- matter of fact , they are booked full for almost the entire month of december .

negative	worst company ever .
neutral	was expecting a total insert including light .
positive	professionally packaged and more than worth the money i paid !

negative	we drive up and are greeted_by a lady that asked us " why are you here "?
negative	reservationcounter . com my confirmation number to get the address .
neutral	otherwise would have been 0 or 0_stars .
neutral	it was made worse , as checking emails on monday_morning provided less that an_hour for actioning .
negative	it was supposed to fit my awd but it was for a fwd .
negative	i what you to know that these kind of people helping you make reservations will not help your business in the long run .

positive	i am completely_satisfied !
positive	would definetly recommed and have done to colleagues at work .
neutral	it is a trust_worthy site but the reason i gave it 0_stars was because of the spending_limit , it was a real inconvenience .
neutral	i still gave 0_stars due to the fact that they did take quick action in helping_me remedy a very difficult situation and they did not charge me additional shipping .
positive	todd
negative	if it wasn_'_t for the fact that she confirmed that there screens are guaranteed to not have any dead_pixels , i would not have bought from them .

positive	thanks
positive	competitive prices .
neutral	i '_ve used fed_ex before and i never had more than one tracking_number .
positive	but i also must_say that all people i talked with , by phone or at their store , were very nice to me .

negative	i find it hard to believe that in such a large college town anyone would do_business this way !
neutral	i talked to the owner - told him what airbnb said he must do .
negative	they did offer to replace the solar_cover if i sent them a sample which i did , but have not heard back . never again
negative	service in shop was excellent , however didn_'_t have curtains we required .
neutral	buttons looked great but we do over 0 , 000 , 000 buttons a year and the price just isn_'_t competitive to use them on a full time basis .
neutral	towels were stained .
negative	very disappointing !
negative	he checked expedia .
neutral	leaving the organisation aside for a moment it is fair to say that the radiator i purchased was good quality and supplied at a good price however .

neutral	it was fast but i only got part of my order and order them at same time no email to say why .
neutral	i emailed them to ask about the other two pieces and then the glove .
positive	great support on the phone , quick delivery , superb service at the fitters , friendly people , will use again
neutral	haven_'_t completed the exchange process so will have to complete 0nd half of survey after all is said and done .
neutral	my only issue is that ukmail delivered my item to a neighbour but did not notify me .
neutral	complex and has_been sitting there since thurs !

positive	technical teams are great to solve my problems .
neutral	i wish they would match free shipping like other_sites do but have to admit , i like the fact that they beat competitor prices by 0 %. depending_on the weight of the product and how much you are buying , it makes_sense to order from this company .
negative	i wish you could rate this company in categories like shipping , customer_service , quality of merchandise and cost .
neutral	i might give them a second chance depending_on what i hear from their representatives when i get a chance to speak to one of them .

neutral	this was my first time using harrisburg_store to order a much needed dr . who toy for my son who loves doctor who .
positive	we had chosen a jeep because it was about $_000 cheaper_than a ford_escape but when we got to the aisle there was no jeep there and we had to double_check with the office that it was alright to take the more_expensive ford .
neutral	thus putting a restriction in the time available to redeem a wowcher wallet .
neutral	the delivery was good and timely .

positive	the garage looked at my lights and my oil level free of charge and offered to top up my oil as it was low .
neutral	we had to pay extra for a shorter delivery time - because oil now so expensive we were nearly out before we had saved enough to re - order 000_litres this was delivered promptly by [_link ] so we have no complaint with them .

neutral	made to feel when finally got a response that i was a nuisance .
positive	keep_up the good work .
positive	ordered and delivered in 0 minutes , perfect service no_problems .
negative	i knew i needed to talk to someone_else it hadn_'_t been 00_minutes since i ordered it so it couldn_'_t have been shipped already .
neutral	trying to get hold of [_name ] is impossible - no one answers the phone , no one responds to emails .
positive	i saved lots of money .
negative	by that time it was full dark , i ' d been up well over 00_hrs , & still had to drive to canterbury , where my timeshare was .
neutral	i am having problems , however , with my female chi - weenie ( chihuahua / dachshund mix ).

neutral	when i checked the car out i was asked to sign a form ($_00 . 00 was on it ) and i asked what it was .
negative	if this is read by anyone in a position of authority , you should appreciate the lessons that are presented here - and thank me .
negative	i have posted this exact_same review on their own website , but seeing how they maintain a 0 . 0 / 0 average review rating on their own website by not posting any negative_reviews , i thought i ' d post it on a few independent sites like this .
neutral	maybe it '_s because they ' re a european company .
negative	i was a bit perturbed , to say the least .
negative	it isn_'_t installed yet , the new date is this coming saturday .
negative	please_note that we do update reviews frequently , and encourage you to
positive	right part , good timing , smooth .

positive	this software solves the problem of getting image albums to work on ipad '_s and iphone '_s that don_'_t support flash player .

neutral	hey !
neutral	but , i also have to say that this is the cheapest shipping out of all the websites i '_ve ordered so_far .
neutral	i would be worried to sign_up for the monthly service , in fear that i wouldn_'_t have the food in time before they ran_out , and with the dog_food being 00_bucks a pop it '_s not like i can spend extra when it '_s not here on time .
positive	i '_ve purchased from cameras to lenses and cases .
neutral	who_knows why underlying damage could be caused including scratching - we will find out once it had been cleaned .
negative	all i can say is that their unprofessionalism and incompetence is matched by no other and i would never recommend this website to anyone .
negative	i only found out after i reread the email , so i '_m thinking ok , someone will contact me to make arrangements to get my order to me .
positive	products were shipped and received before that next weekend … coast to coast .
positive	i received my item very quick .
neutral	i ordered a " statement necklace " and was most excited about that but it arrived missing a stone . so i unfortunately get to see what the experience with returns is like .
positive	overall 0_star
positive	i was skeptical at first but , their response to solve my ticket issues was swift . i will recommend this site to all i know .
negative	the wig that i purchased is also way too small to fit a normal adult sized head .
positive	it came a couple of days_later and i fitted it the same day .
positive	working as part of the trustpilot team is a true pleasure .
neutral	so i order two dresses and found that the shipping is out of site there bargains are very good but shipping will kill you .
positive	they have even returned my money against policy when my plans were interupted .
positive	the next_day i ordered them through internet at milletsports ,
positive	maybe they will replace it .
negative	i emailed frames_direct enquiring what is taking so long and have not received a reply .

positive	flying from massachusetts to arizona ( with a plane change in minneapolis ), there was no way that i would lug my clubs to and from the airport .
negative	we contacted them but nobody picked it up and respond .
neutral	however the only communication was when i rang the company about the order and to ask for delivery date .
negative	how can a hotel adjust their rates so sporadically and not be considered fraudulent when third - party companies promoting howard_johnson are buying out customers to figure_out through their own mistake that they have booked with a hotel branch that does not take its customers / occupants seriously enough to match those prices or compensate them .
neutral	i had put my daughter '_s name and address for delivery , and a couple of days_later , i was phoned and quizzed - had i asked for delivery to a separate address and why .
neutral	we '_ll see if they deserve the three stars .
negative	no one received their emails .

neutral	it turns_out it was not .
neutral	the lady was quite abrupt and unhelpful in time_frame for exchange goods and i had to chase up the exchange .
positive	like most of you guys , it '_s not so much the money as the pride in fixing it yourself .
negative	!
negative	upon_contacting the customer service team all i received was a notification to say that a change in flight would cost me a further 000_euro .
negative	even_though i '_ve rented 0 times in less_than 0 months with them , they still want me to bring a utility bill .
neutral	return instructions were slightly better but not much .
negative	when he went inside to to check in he was told the reservation was made for the following_day .
neutral	just hoping it won_'_t happen again should i order i would of preferred the postage put back in my bank as apposed to it being refunded to my boohoo account .
positive	most other_places would still be waiting upto 00 days well_done uk_sport imports .
negative	there ought to be a law addressing low - down and dirty practices .
neutral	the next time i need parts , i will remember the incorrect information , the incorrect delivery date quoted , my incorrect e_-_mail address , and the incorrect origin of manufacture .
neutral	thank_goodness a windscreen company was there to confirm it was an old repair .
negative	one i did not receive a confirmation for .
positive	we quickly found a unit within our price range and reserved it .
neutral	i think if you are going to send a product back , getting it to the customer quickly should be a high priority .
neutral	knowing that [_link ] were there on the following_day , made we wish i ’ d gone with them .
positive	very fast service .
positive	great service , cheapest price , super_fast delivery

neutral	i don_'_t like having paid for premium dog_food that arrives with it '_s air vacuum being broken .
positive	a little disgruntled that i was billed_twice for a second time on my purchases , however the team are very efficient and hopefully this wont happen a third time .
neutral	the clear lens glasses are not ideal vision .
negative	i shouldn_'_t have to pay to send back a part i received damaged .
neutral	they do have a nice selection , however the price for the same item has gone up several_times over the last couple of years .
negative	horrible company , horrible customer_service , horrible products !!

negative	as a large daycare it is mandatory that our children have nap mats to rest on now it is going to take several weeks before because we have to send the ripped ones back and pay for shipping and then they will take a look at the ripped ones and then decide if they are going to replace them ???
neutral	i have requested an_rma and was forced to pay more at the dealer due to the fact that my system was open when i found that the parts were for the wrong vehicle .
positive	if future business goes the same way wd will be doing all my dog shopping here . now if they would only carry toys for the dog .
positive	dolphin_fitness really did keep their word , got the order correct and kept in touch with friendly emails every_step of the way from purchase to receipt of the delivery .

neutral	love the pics but they need to fix their pricing .
positive	i get special e_-_mails of all deals and the low_cost and shipping is also a no_brainer .
neutral	both size 00s one was the correct size and the other was massive .

neutral	nice service but mistakes were made twice in the booking .

negative	follow_up : i have discovered an_additional_$_00 in fees a month after returning the car .
neutral	they were so quick to take the money out my account but so slow with shipping .
neutral	i would be very happy to receive a refund on the postage as in my view the goods should not have been shipped until i was made aware of the change in the number being sent .
positive	great price on a new compressor that works great .
positive	free shipping ?
neutral	i called my card , they said the fraud dept put a hold due to ' unusual foreign activity '.

neutral	yet the customer_service working directly with your company is difficult .
negative	very disappointed in this transaction .
negative	while it '_s human nature to make mistakes , the customer_service people i dealt_with were nice enough but completely bungled my reservation cancellation .
neutral	therefore as these sort of things can always happen i will pay a little_bit more and have flexibility with another rental company

neutral	usually my go to site for travel is travelocity - when i ordered my plane_tickets i did not check the waiver at the top for additional insurance - when i looked for my confirmation i did not have my flight to florida .
negative	so the purpose of the case is to protect our computer if it is treated badly , they say that it has_been treated badly , but our computers have been damaged and therefore not protected by the case , and even_though that is the purpose of the case , they cannot offer us even a replacement .
neutral	i think customer_service needs looking into seriously in all_aspects .
positive	i would recomend this site to anyone_who needs to save $ and get things done .
positive	there was no change in quality of service . great .

negative	its a wonder they get any customers really .
neutral	after i paid the $-- then i did the on - line search to see the parts_geek reputation ( i know -- too_late )
neutral	however , the price increase may be driven somewhat by what appears to be a giant advertising program now being used by ancestry . com .
negative	they were horrible about customer_service from the get go , but the dagar in the heart was when i received my shipment .
neutral	pity that upon delivery 0 of the chairs were broken .

neutral	there is now a slight gap and water now collects on that side .
neutral	i don_'_t have a problem with the employees , they were nice . my issues with this company is that the storage_units are way over priced .
positive	but they are very dependable , extremely quick with the shipping , and have really great prices - and unlike_other_sites they don_'_t advertise low_prices and then ask you to make up the difference on shipping and handling_charges - instead they charge the straight up actual shipping_costs which are really not much , and it '_s usually really easy to either purchase over the threshold for free shipping or pick_up an item that makes your entire order free shipping .
neutral	i would have assumed they would be here by now .
negative	customer service is terrible
negative	do not purchase from them .
positive	good website , seem to know what they ' re doing .

negative	i '_ve either been really unlucky or i live in part of the world which they have issues distributing to ( north west england ) but the report in all honesty of my own experiences its been ( which i hate to say ) painfully disappointing and have ended_up doing something which i initially came to shopto to avoid which was go and actually buy the game from the local town shopping centre .

neutral	ordered on 00 - 0 today is 00 - 00 still_waiting for part very slow . ordered parts from other_suppliers had part in 0 to 0 days .
negative	delivery took 0_weeks , charged_twice for the transition lens option , unable to resolve via phone and email , as a last_resort i filed a “ dispute charges ” with my credit_card company .

neutral	when i pointed_out that not all carriers did post_code pricing i was literally told i could pay or cancel my order !
negative	the next_day both reservations showed_up on the credit_card -- the first one never showed_up with an e_- mail verification .
neutral	not fond that the company requires you to have home / renters insurance or they charge you $_00 . 00 , there are many places that have a waiver that is signed refusing insurance on your items , as in my case , my units items have no value ??
negative	this was a costly experience .
positive	great service .

neutral	this all happened without my knowledge of it !
positive	there are charts to tell what size you are in what country etc .
neutral	i ordered several items and most fit , however , one shirt was already torn in one spot and the jacket that said it was true to size on the website was not true to size at all .
negative	the credibility of the comment is just thrown out the window when it says " the support staff he got immediate_response ", as it literally took a few hours .
neutral	however , the price that is advertised is without tax which i always feel misleads people as it was added at the end .
neutral	quality and professional look of the labels that i purchased were beautiful but way smaller_than i expected to pay for the price !
positive	couldn_'_t have asked for a better deal !

neutral	to make me more annoyed , they sent me a message that evening which implied they had tried to deliver - they hadn_'_t .
positive	i '_ve had two orders produced and i am completely happy with the results of both .
neutral	that time is all on you , the company won_'_t even ship a replacement unless you pay for it again .

positive	i '_ve yet to have to call priceline as their bookings have always worked_flawlessly .

positive	i am gratified and i am pretty sure my old friend will be delighted with her arrangement and chocolates .
positive	i '_m thrilled so_far - i hope you keep_up the good work .
negative	i would never suggest this company to anyone because as far as i '_m concerned , bullying is not an appropriate or professional sales tactic .
neutral	this is because the tank is in a locked outhouse to try to prevent theft of oil .
positive	i was also contacted by phone
positive	but both of rushmypassport '_s customer_service folks - brad weber and teddy_etienne - were great .
positive	i sent it in for repair via their fed_ex shipping label on a wednesday and i had it back the following_tuesday .

negative	i was forced to cancel the reservation and re - book .
neutral	seeing as i paid by paypal , i found this highly suspicious , and rang them to tell them i was not prepared to do this .
negative	please do you research on this company and you will find i am not alone .
neutral	there was no follow_up to her that it failed .
neutral	i would recommend having someone that specialises in web user_interface or web user experience to take a look at how the flow can be improved and how management of accounts and bids could be consolidated into a single page , perhaps with wish_list functionality , sidebars , or better use of ' watch this bid ' - listing all available bids on a single page , or allowing to sort into tab , list or ' file ' type format
positive	you turned my somewhat profitable business into more profitable because of the quality , price and service of your products .
negative	he finally gets off phone and says this is our unit and starts to walk out the door with a look of intent of needing a tip for doing nothing .
negative	very disappointed .
neutral	my last order included many root bound plants .
neutral	wouldnt say to not deal with them but expect delays in ordering products that cost over € 0000 . 00 .
positive	their online and phone support is really good and their agents are friendly and knowledgable -- you will not be talking to someone in another country reading answers to your questions from a troubleshooting guide .
negative	nor has this issue been resolved .
positive	my issue was addressed promptly and sucessfully .
positive	i was very pleased .
neutral	other than this problem it was okay but i would have rather spoken to someone at the clarion in shepherdstown . a live_person didn_'_t answer the phone at this location and i couldn_'_t understand the voice_mail message .
positive	can '_t fault this company & would definitely order from them again
positive	little known fact : amazon sells books .
positive	i was leery of the low price , but it was exactly_what i wanted , plus it arrived so quickly , i will come_back for chevy parts in the future .

neutral	hope it won_'_t happen again .
positive	thanks guys !

neutral	and , who_knows_how long this printer sat in a warehouse before i bought it at that sale ?
neutral	i like the autoship discount option .

neutral	when ordering from u . s . it is important to get the right parts .
neutral	when booking direct with the cruise line as done on previous trips , the communication and follow_up was a lot more user_friendly as travelocity offered no follow_up to give us a second opportunity to grab the promotional_items before time ran_out .

negative	•_“ you have to cancel your hotel reservation and re - book it again for a later date .
neutral	the person_who took my reservation , put it through twice , thus i was charged double for a one night_stay .

positive	thank_you for fast delivery . product was easy to install .
neutral	** i wanted to add that since sorting out my flights they have called me back re our hotel reservation and booked us a room for the night ** so i think my experience would '_ve been four_stars had it not been for the ridiculously long hold time on the phone .

neutral	with " distance_selling " ( for the consumer ) it can be fraught with problems and purchase of a roland gr00 from their website for £_000 . 00 recently resulted_in the wrong coloured item being shipped .
positive	you will not be disappointed with this service and the cost is not bad .
positive	i have used cult_pens now in two different_countries over a period of 0 years and found the site to be accurately informative and service excellent .
positive	every response seemed to come minutes after sending a question .
negative	i was mortified and terrified for our safety .
negative	the reason was that the credit_card used to guarantee the stay had been canceled a couple of weeks before due to fraudulent use .
negative	they didn_'_t even get an orchid because they were " out " of the product .

neutral	these things happen .
negative	this is costing me a quiz in my class .

positive	would highly_recommend using
neutral	nowt happened .
positive	i would recommend this company to anyone_who_wants value for money .
positive	i will buy from them again .
positive	even after the annuity was established , they followed_up to make_sure everything had started okay .
positive	so my excellent rating is contingent upon how the repair is handled .
negative	i now have a different opinion of the company .
negative	parts ordered were not complete .
positive	delivery time was lighting quick .
positive	i am the proud_owner of a 0000_vw gti which i have only owned for about a month .

positive	the mattress we bought was of excellent quality and was delivered really quickly .
neutral	when i arrived at the counter , they couldn_'_t find my booking .
positive	they are probably part of the reason_why i am addicted to the track , i don_'_t know if i would have gotten as into it if i hadn_'_t been to their shop and talked to their guys .
positive	i would definitely contact them should i need anything special in the future and will certainly recommend them to any of my friends looking for that something different , knowing that they will be completely_satisfied with the service and quality of their purchases .
negative	do not order from them unless you have lots of extra money to pay for their mistakes .
negative	finally , you get a hold of someone and they tell you there is nothing they can do " you have to do everything online " and then they hang up on you .
neutral	not good .
neutral	however , i booked a car with hertz and after arriving an_hour past the time i ' d given ( i never knew that this was somehow a firm arrival time ) they had given my car away and i had to spend an extra hour messing_around while they found me a car .
neutral	but i was charged $_00 for shipping within the continental u . s .

positive	i couldn_'_t be_happier .
neutral	unfortunately , there were a few typos , formatting problems , and translation errors in the translations i received for approval , so clients need to be sure to proofread .
positive	thanks mike !
negative	thanks for nothing .
positive	when i receivied it i found it was the wrong one , which rarely_happens with screen_country orders .
negative	when a carrier fails to show yet again and after 0 . 00_minutes on a live_chat with customer service i come away in tears , exhausted , beaten down into submission . there is little point to a chat service who do not answer a query point by point , ignore the query and instead just quote something else which is irrelevant to the query at you .
neutral	i found the price with gadget very good - although the website in my opinion , wasnt very clear .
neutral	totally_unacceptable , the system needs a review .
positive	i first decided to try them out and its been great since day one .
negative	er du bange for at kunderne skal høre om jeres dårlige service ?"
positive	i have used shopto for years and have always recieved games before or on released day .

negative	i will never think of buying from these_people again .
neutral	i was going to order 00 different items during your april " free shipping " promo and right before clocking the order button , i realized that i was still being charged for shipping .
neutral	so , the panel itself , agents a 0_star_rating , the customer_service agent , maryum , gets a 0_star_rating , but quality control . not much .
positive	within just a few_days we had everything put_together for an amazing trip .
neutral	also , when i have tried to contact customer_service it can take_awhile & and shipping_costs alot !
positive	they have always gone out of their way to make_sure that our needs have been met and in a really timely_fashion .

positive	i bought my item from their website after looking at other_websites .
positive	delivery is extremely quick .
negative	ill never use this site again .
positive	especialy with homeopathic_remedies , the cost adds up , and often you need a remedy like yesterday .

positive	thank_you .
negative	i double_checked the confirmation_email , which said delivery would be on the 00th , emailed to find out where the order was ( which you have still not replied to ), and had to get a family_member to pick_up flowers for me on the day as i live_abroad .

positive	!
neutral	whilst nicely renovated it could have done with a good clean .
neutral	if you want more customers , code your website a little better , i believe you guys need a completely new design that doesn_'_t make it look like your entering a scam website of sorts .

negative	i thought i was simply making a reservation , and my credit_card was required to hold the reservation .
neutral	i don_'_t know if this is how its done , or if i was supposed to pay extra for the stuff i need to attach it to my bumper . but it just seems *&% backwards .
neutral	due to the fact that the boiler was to be serviced on the tuesday we left the gate unlocked , imagine my surprise to come home on the tuesday and find our oil had been delivered , your local_supplier did not call and as such the tank was locked , so he filled through the vent pipe , must have taken him ages .
neutral	if it were out of stock it should be posted that way before you order
neutral	if you are going to give a returning customer a discount , good business would be not to make them have to buy a certain_amount to use it .
negative	with the scenario i explained .

negative	yes , you don_'_t pay now , but you may pay a lot more later .
neutral	also check the expiration_dates closely .
negative	!
negative	so the tickets have arrived in virginia when we are in london , and the concert is in london in 0 days .
positive	i believe the ' free seed ' gift itself should be more personal to the customer , by possibly looking at which products the customer has purchased and offer a free seed with similar characteristics to the ones a customer has purchased .
neutral	i called the motel and they said , oh , no , you have to do that through_travelocity .
positive	our product always arrive real quick !

negative	in the past the customer service was fairly good at oldies but now it stinks . i would give it no stars but that was not an option given
neutral	maybe it is an old version or a replica ?
neutral	the response was generic and didn_'_t help .
positive	i talked to him on the phone and said i have purchased a replacement warranty from square_trade which also has accident coverage and that i would get him a new table soon .
neutral	i had to argue that the voucher already included all the add -_ons i wanted and i had no interest in the additional insurances she had tagged on , which included road - side assistance and break / enter protection .
positive	mouler bean cleannnnnnnnnnnnn greattttttttttt .
negative	customer service is impossible to contact by phone leaving you only emails every other day or when they feel_like it .

negative	no email with confirmation number or receipt .
negative	oct - 00 - 0000
positive	nice price , came on time , fit_perfectly .
neutral	why this matters : for my particular order i made a mistake on sizing and wrote to customer service a minute after i had placed the order online to make a change .
positive	al bij al een_goede ervaring !
negative	tl_; dr every time you send a glass for repair it will most_likely cost you $_00 dollars .
neutral	good job united !
negative	so you already know what my feedback is going to be .
neutral	because of the delay and extra_cost , for me to try this again , i would have to be unable to get to the pet_food store .
positive	we were very surprised that a ' website ' had such friendly , smart , helpful folks working behind the scenes .
neutral	very poor because we are on the route for travellers to the appleby gipsy fair and a new tyre could prove tempting to any passer by .
negative	they require you to come in with a paycheck stub or a utility bill in your name .
neutral	what .
neutral	i guess it '_s alright , but its such a dated site .
positive	0 out of 0_stars for great service .
positive	oh_yea , free stuff , there '_s plenty of that and i '_ve yet to be dissapointed with quality or service .
neutral	so who do you think was responsible ?
neutral	then it seemed liked the their service went to hell in a hand basket .
positive	i waited around 00 days for mine but for a total of 00 quid including delivery you can '_t go wrong .

neutral	did not get it .
positive	it was getting rather expensive , but now that i have awesome batteries , i know i am good for at_least a year or better and it '_s even cheaper_than if i continued to purchase batteries for the next month .
negative	they auto canceled just that one part of the order with out giving me the option to cancel the whole thing .
neutral	i was aware that there would be a service charge but did not think it included the amount of the agree voucher .

positive	will_definitely recommend to anyone looking to purchase electronics .
neutral	on a perdu 0 h à_l arrivée : on s est fait très mal recevoir par les autres loueurs et_le numéro de téléphone local de donnait pas le bon interlocuteur .
negative	friday , and the weekend pass with no delivery .
neutral	it was not a secure sight to order .

positive	i '_ll be back to order more !

neutral	i hope they get in touch with me ?
positive	the communication from logomojo was timely and helpful .
positive	they have hard to find better - brands too at great prices .
neutral	unlike_other agencies i '_ve used which usually give a carbon copy of the information you sign , they just keep a plain record which could potentially be changed .
negative	it was a waste of time but i might as well warn you , dont be_fooled by their price matching and shipping fees .
negative	while i can understand this could be for safety so no one jumps from a second floor .
negative	you are instruicted to wait for someopne to call you so you may get a tracking_number for your return which will not be accepted if you do not have the assigned tracking_number .

positive	it is a great idea .
neutral	the tracking_number should have been provided by e_-_mail the same as the order confirmation .
negative	i contacted both book_byte and the seller that is represented by bookbyte and neither one have been able ( willing ?)
positive	quick shipping !
negative	a few_days_later and they haven_'_t contacted me to apologise or offer a refund .
negative	!
negative	on top of that , when i called white_flower farms to find out what happened to my order , their customer_service people were totally defensive and told me i was wrong to feel that shipment was too slow .
neutral	maybe because the delivery was from butler_fuels . who we have also ordered from in the past !
positive	b_&_h has one of the best online shopping sites out there !
positive	thanks .
positive	i loved that i got my translated documents so quickly and it was so easy to order !
neutral	this is a huge problem and i never got an_email or any notification that it was not coming .
neutral	nice frames .

neutral	i have booked with this firm before , so persisted despite problems with booking form and pop_ups .
negative	this is shady and i don_'_t understand_why my 00 and 0 year_old kids have to wait in the car while they try and figure this out .

neutral	paid for the item and then received a notice that the item is out of stock . this has happened three_times now .
negative	nor were booking inquiries ever delivered to my email address .

neutral	a classic case of over promising and under achieving for me , so i '_ll be getting my games elsewhere from now on .
neutral	customer_service is slow to answer e_- mailed queries ( mine have taken a week ), and even then the question is not answered .
neutral	i have applied to some of the positions i am qualified for but have not heard back from any of them .
neutral	i understand wanting a credit_card to hold a reservation , but actually charging the card for a reservation that is several months out doesn_'_t seem right .
neutral	there were lots of breaks and down time .
neutral	i know the site is changing , but navigating it takes more steps than it should .
negative	be sure to read
neutral	i asked him to walk me through it said , ' i don_'_t know what it is you don_'_t understand .'

negative	( yes , that is what he said ) naturally , i did not want my clients charged an extra $ 0000 for duplicate tickets of the flight they have already paid for so i called air_lingus ( 0 minute hold time ) and was advised the tickets can most certainly be refunded , travelocity would just have to call in and get the waiver code , no_issues .

neutral	if this is repeated next month , i will leave the " spoiledrotten " program , as i will not condone this kind of false_advertising preying on patriots .
negative	did i read that correctly ?
negative	original box ?
neutral	presumably they did this so that they could sell the original ink separately ( or maybe it '_s a refurb , although that certainly wasn_'_t indicated on the site ).

positive	i went in expecting to be told you '_ll need a big down payment , that wasn_'_t the case at all .
negative	the sender goes to their bank in person , pays a fee to wire money directly from the senders account into another account .
neutral	he should have made the offer without asking for anything and then let_me make the decision to change my feedback , not tell me what he will give me if i change it !
negative	do not for one moment even consider buying from this vendor .
neutral	we ordered a nice one at hudson_reed , however , upon paying , i neglected to notice the delivery address had automatically come up as my previous address .
neutral	where things went a little astray , in my opinion , was when i found myself at the end of a conversation that , to all intents and purposes , made it sound like i had enquired and authorized an extended_warranty .
negative	am i the only one with this problem ?
positive	highly_recommended !
positive	and the auto delivery will help to ensure your not running around when you realize you are out of dog or cat_food .

neutral	then i took out the garbage and saw the shipping_label on the package .
positive	fingers_crossed the delivery date etc will be as wonderful .
neutral	i recieved the muffler / pipes intact but with some dents .
neutral	as one of the original clients of petflow automatic delivery who stopped using them , not because of their price , service or products but because my primary dog that ate the majority of food died , i was disappointed upon reordering .
neutral	worse of all , some of the instructions are wrong and the pictures are wrong , too - so you waste time putting it together , taking it apart again , then putting it together .
negative	don_'_t go to drive time .
negative	avoid .
neutral	easy to navigate ordering system .
negative	that is more aggrevating than anything .
negative	i do not think i will use this service again .
neutral	he agreed to refund me for the extra plinth and also the difference in cost between the 000 wall unit and the 000 unit .
negative	they claim they tried to contact me earlier in the week but couldnt locate my contact info .
positive	great place to buy from .
positive	i discovered b_&_h years_ago when i was still shooting film .
negative	i ask to speak to the supervisor and i am told the supervisor was already consulted .
positive	friendly staff .
negative	nothing every works after you pay $_000 for using the software the magic disappears .
neutral	however , it was not delivered on the day it was supposed to be ( it was a day late ).

positive	this is also my most favorite clothing store now .
positive	i would recommend this company to anyone .
negative	the threads on them seemed to be not right .
neutral	i will_continue to buy there .
positive	i buy from them all the time and love this company .
neutral	that '_s not a problem , but just for fun i went to the dark rome site and looked at prices - found the exact_same tour for less ( not much , 0 euros , but still ).
neutral	if i had known the order would not be shipped out until 0 + days_later , not sure if
positive	on top of all this caring came a great deal on my 0000_jeep_wrangler .
neutral	however , shipping is somewhat slow and the order arrived in pieces several days apart making timing of installation awkward .
positive	helen plumb , just gems
neutral	three_weeks_later i received ashley '_s brisbane bay mattress .

neutral	i have always parked at silver sevens in las_vegas and the service was good .
positive	don_'_t hassle with filling out multiple website and searches .
negative	i realized that i did not call the hotel_directly as thought .
neutral	the prices are competitive ( not always the cheapest ), customer service is excellent and the shipping is fast .
neutral	these dame people come to my back door through my garden past my washing all because they were too lazy to find front_door ( down_side of house ) just watch the delivery notes do not make any difference
negative	you communication is terrible i spent 00_mins on hold not all of us over 00 want to go to a web_site we need to talk to a real_person . i also do not under stand why i do not get a detailed invoice .
positive	ordering from pcgamesupply . com is very easy and hassle_free .
positive	do your_homework and you should be more than happy the shop b_&_h over and over again .
negative	i was told i would get a call back to update me of when i would get my final bill and then they would refund the monies owing .
negative	since there was no returns note i rang the company on several_occasions and left email messages .
negative	several phone_calls and e_-_mail went_unanswered .
neutral	i will_definitely be looking at prices more carefully next year and trying to place my order earlier in the summer .
negative	you tell the business your unhappy with the product and if you can return it due to them not properly describing the product .
negative	so basically this is a huge scam in order for them to get more money from your pocket to theirs .
positive	would recommend to all my family and friends

neutral	by the time you get to view your key , it will be sold out .

positive	after just one shipment , i am in love with mr . chewy '_s online dog_food service .
neutral	the service i first received was great , the car , which was a used car was ready when i asked for it to be so .
positive	the most amazing thing is that the shipment arrived within a few_days of the order instead of a week or two .
negative	i bought something from them and they sent me the wrong part .
positive	first order was 000_% ok have just sent off another order and all looks good thanks cms will use you again .
positive	i have used next for many years for online shopping .
positive	brilliant .
positive	here '_s hoping for many more !
negative	i think that there return process is horrible .
neutral	i ordered a part with the year model of 0000 .
neutral	it seems pointless , and misleading to ask customers to choose a time convenient for themselves , when there is no_intention of adhering to it .
positive	i was very happy with the over all delivery service , and found it very reassuring that i got emails and text_messages updating me with the delivery process .
negative	so now because of their mistake i have to wait 00 days to even begin the process of claiming my money back , jokers !
positive	i ordered on sunday and my parcel arrived on tuesday_morning .
negative	i regularly order from amazon , target , sears and walmart . and orders from these stores arrive within 0 or 0 days tops -- they use fedex like you , but i get my orders much sooner .

neutral	the dog_treats were much smaller_than_expected .
neutral	they have so_far kept their charge . so heres hoping !
negative	i was given yet a different answer !
negative	didn_'_t like tone of response whatsoever .
positive	buyer_beware living_social - they have no scrupples & try to dodge paying out when " offers " are not met .

neutral	in essence_many of the recent reviews of angry_guests about airbnb are either_fake or the guests did not take the appropriate_precautions such as choosing a host with many positive_reviews so they get what they ask for .
neutral	that '_s the trouble with buying online .
neutral	i have used autoeurope before and it has_been great - i love the concept of a voucher that covers everything so you aren_'_t trying to decipher what is required and what is a con when you get to the rental_counter .
negative	if the delay is not suitable , please call our sales_team who will be happy to go through some alternatives which we can get dispatched to you quicker .
positive	gak were extremely_helpful and polite .

positive	the package was very well_wrapped .
neutral	i got one notification when it left and didn_'_t get anything_else until the day before it got to my city .
positive	no further dialogue .
positive	got a really good price on what i primarily wanted , and then an_additional 00_%_off on checkout which was rather good .
negative	prices are good but don_'_t expect it for about 0_weeks , maybe because i still don_'_t have my order .
positive	amazing .
positive	amazing service all the way through .
positive	excellent experince from the flow of the web_site to ordering .
positive	their catalog is endless and new products are being added very day .

neutral	this has tainted what started as a very good experience .
negative	i based the cost on the pounds to dollars conversion rate .
neutral	the ( female ) guide was obviously bored and not interested in explaining much about what we were seeing , merely going through the motions .
negative	when time came to go back to heathrow , there were no trains that could get me there in a reasonable time from glasgow , so i drove south .
positive	so fast !
neutral	i continue to purchase my ink_cartridges because of the price and the service given , and would recommend that others do likewise .
negative	after giving her my credit_card number , i asked about the room .
neutral	did not recieve until friday .
positive	i then got a further email_advising me that delivery would take place between 00 : 00 and 00 : 00 .
negative	we arrived at 00 : 00 and was not seen until 00 : 00 - which was aggravating .
neutral	although the site is very useful for finding places to stay and even booking , the system sometimes overrides booking and other administrative tasks at the given hostels that you are staying at !
negative	i did .
neutral	too many lags and buffering when trying to use uk websites
neutral	he advised me what i should do on my return , and there he was at 0000pm being courteous , smiling and very helpful .
neutral	not regular car renters , but active travellers , we rented a car in belgium that could have been easier - the ' downtown ' office was 0 km outside of town ( which we knew in advance ), and was under_construction so our cab driver had a hard time finding it .
negative	i received an_email hours after i submitted my request to check on the status of my order .
negative	how come you have no phone contact information .
negative	will never buy another marchon frame ever .
positive	for free !

positive	i was then given a delivery date .
neutral	and score updates
negative	never again will i order from this site !
positive	from searching for the part that i needed to installing it on my car , the experience could not have been better !
neutral	learned my lesson and will pay extra for the name_brand rental companies next time .
negative	were told that we were buying natural wood but later find out it is coloured .

positive	quality of product ( kmc chain ) is excellent and they delivered at no additional_cost the next_day .
negative	i heard_nothing but good reviews about framesdirect and i was excited about my order .
negative	the car was horrible .

neutral	after many emails backwards and forwards i eventually received the cuff_links on the 00th of may .
negative	they do list a phone_number , but calling it only gets you put on hold until they hang_up on you several hours_later .
neutral	having heard_nothing , at five past one i called the booking centre who said they would have someone phone me .
neutral	jeg åbner så mit kabinet , for at tage kortet ud så_jeg_kan_få det pakket .

positive	the cost was $_00 . 00 each way .
negative	i booked either an expedition or excursion from budget because it specifically said it would hold 0 passengers and 0 pieces of luggage .
neutral	unfortunately i booked tickets when the company had trouble with its computer system , which i know isn_'_t the companies fault .
negative	at no time did i receive a paid invoice - i had to ask for one .
negative	but it seems if they give you ten days_later to turn_around and pay your car note !!
negative	i had to return a part that was damaged and pay the shipping charge and insurance fee to return it .
negative	but very slow in responding to calls and emails .
positive	time made to time estimate for install .
neutral	once i get my products , my opinion might change , but as my header_says , sitting on pin and needles .
negative	if it '_s reliability you need stay_away from this lot .
negative	there is no way to have an active account with these_guys and not have your credit_card details on file .
positive	!
positive	easy to order .
neutral	also the receipt / scanning device to let_me out of the parking_lot didn_'_t work at first and i had to fiddle with that and get wet again .
neutral	it so happens that i leave the little dogs with access to that part of the yard .
negative	i emailed , i called .
negative	but then i realized there was an_error with the number of people on the booking .
positive	you guys are great in every_aspect . the customer service , free shipping , great prices on the greatest product , the videos .
negative	i called and was told to send an_email and the money would be refunded .
neutral	one purchase , one deal , not per room per purchase .
neutral	had to cut it down to fit .
neutral	the mattress is not as good as the one i ordered , but it '_s not bad either .

neutral	well that email was setup as a forward address ,
positive	completely_satisfied with purchase and shipping , i would use them any time
neutral	pick_up from airport on return was a disaster - over an_hour between calling for pickup and being picked_up by shuttle .
neutral	i did finally get the correct part and the price is ok but after a month from my first ordered placed i am still_awaiting my refund .
neutral	we contacted you asking to change the car and received the instructions to return to the rental_agency in florence .
positive	this was my first ever online purchase for ink and i am very happy .
neutral	that needs to be addressed .
neutral	my part was supposed to arrive last friday 0 / 00 .
positive	i love how there is no charge to make a reservation , and once you do , it takes no_longer_than 0 minutes for your confirmation and the storage_facility calls you as well to confirm it .
negative	0 days to process a purchase ?
negative	they should not claim to provide speedy service if they can '_t live up to their promise .
negative	i had ordered size 0 shoes , and for one pair , i got a left size 0 and the right a size 0 or 0 . 0 .
positive	! thanks partsgeek !!

negative	i then recieved an_email_stating they recieved my returned package ( just an automatic email , nothing personal ) that told me i would hear something within 00_hours , which again was a lie .
neutral	still_awaiting a new one a week_later !

neutral	lifelock , here i come .

neutral	it was cafateria fish and chips .
neutral	this hotel is in a great location .
positive	what made us even happier
negative	i will never buy from parts_geek again !
neutral	sometimes cheaper is not the best path .
positive	good range of products , really fast delivery and always an e_- mail to tell us if goods are out of stock or delayed .
positive	very fast delivery of some basic stationery that i had not found elsewhere .
neutral	wanted to buy this irish_velvet for a long time , great to have it for christmas , only_thing is it is much more_expensive when you have to pay six pound for delivery , but had to buy it . would be a good ldea if you made your delivery a lot cheaper , or even free .
negative	to be effective march 0st .
neutral	bad points :
negative	buyer_beware !!!
negative	i was up between the 0 : 00 - noon time range , nothing .
neutral	overall not bad !
positive	very happy to use again .
negative	my first call was to set_up one night in chicago .
positive	i '_ve been using priceline for 00 + years_now and always quite satisfied with the results and savings .
negative	when you return parts they are at your expense so i wanted to be sure the proper parts would be ordered the next time .
neutral	hardly anything new and just seems like a waste of time with all the minutia .
positive	if i ever need parts again , i '_ll go here first !
negative	the website is clear and quite appealing .
negative	no way to communicate with anyone about the issue .
negative	i sent a brand_new book in double bubble_wrap and was told it didn_'_t meet the standards .

negative	jeg tager begge dele , går ud_af døren og kaster begge dele i skraldespanden udenfor .
neutral	i found the overall booking process fairly easy to do online . however when i decided i would like to extend my car_hire as i was staying for longer_than planned it turned_out to be a major hassle !
positive	we had a little adjusting to do to the propane tank holder . the lid didn_'_t open enough , but just moving it back helped .
negative	i will be more than willing to change my perception and not spread negativity about them if they had a real_person to speak to and actually provided anything close to customer service .
neutral	it arrived two_days after that , may 00 -- a full week of shipping time .
neutral	for car_rental deposit , limiting for some days my cash capability .
neutral	at this time i am waiting to get it resolved .
positive	moisturising eyedrops arrived with 00_hours .
negative	highly disappointed and frustrated
negative	you will then receive generic response that has nothing to do to your problem .
negative	don_'_t be_fooled by the nice web_site , this people obviously have no inventory and no control over their supplier '_s inventory .
neutral	i ordered 0 bottles of algaecide and 0 bottles of metal out 0_weeks_ago ( we are on well water and have to use the metal out each year or we have staining on our white steps ).
neutral	plus they really stunk !
neutral	i received what i ordered , and in a timely_fashion , but i didn_'_t get the free pill splitter that they advertise comes with the order .
neutral	i was so excited because i '_m going on a trip soon and i wanted a couple new outfits .
negative	the ordering procedure was very vague - no item description or picture to clarify what was being ordered .
negative	and now it '_s january_00th 0000 !
neutral	i made my first order for my hp_ink_cartridges from inkfarm .
positive	if you are looking for a service that can find the best possible rental space for you based on price , proximity , size and availability then you want to use the spare_foot application or program .
negative	also , don_'_t expect any help from their customer_services team as they either don_'_t reply or just say anything to get_rid of you .
negative	i live in florida and send two gift_cards to my dad in ohio who was suffering from cancer and poverty , so i wanted to help him as he '_s been unemployed since his surgery and his house was four months behind on payments .

negative	after a whole page and 0_weeks waiting i had to contact milletts myself , since they had not contacted me .
negative	i '_ve never had a worse experience with an online_retailer .
neutral	the strange thing is that when my wife purchased her glasses last_year from same company , no_hidden_fees were accessed to her .
neutral	free shipping isn_'_t such a good deal when there ' sa $ 00handling charge .
neutral	this was not ideal for us and not a great representation of simple safety solutions .
neutral	i am still having to buy eyedrops every month to prevent the dry eyes .
neutral	i was happy with the fast shipping .
positive	you should definitely shop_here for unique office_supplies .
negative	you need to check into it .
positive	i ordered the steel versions of asuna '_s and kirito '_s swords from sword art online through allanimecosplay .

negative	that right , negative $_00 .
positive	everything was customized to our family and our desires .
neutral	had i known that i wouldn_'_t have wasted so much time finding just the right picture and cropping it just so .
neutral	the second was in the description of the camera .
positive	i was looking for photo coasters for an anniversary and stumbled_upon your website .
positive	i trawled the internet to find the best price for ray_ban aviators and i discovered vision_direct australia .
neutral	she was the most pleasant .
positive	but based on other customers ' reviews , it seems they are made of good quality .
neutral	i was called and told it needed some work - the front outer cv boots needed replacing and the rocker cover gaskit this work would cost just over_£_000 including the service .
positive	and he explained the brand of food to me , it is an all natural food product with the essential nutrients in it my dog needs so i decided to try a small bag of it to see how buddy would do on it , and he_loves it !
negative	0 ) i will never book travel online as a package deal with any online travel service again .

negative	i have had one nightmare after another using third_party booking services .
positive	will use again !
neutral	recently i decided to give them another go .
negative	i did not receive the accommodation vouchers so just took the itinerary details with me .

positive	i searched easytobook for hotels in boston and came_across a great price for a 0 * hotel so i decided to book straightaway .
positive	thank_you .
neutral	he didn_'_t introduce himself properly and banged on about me not having a locking_wheel nut key , before realising my car didn_'_t have this beause it didn_'_t need one .
neutral	after one - half_hour asked for supervisor and am still on hold over one hour without ever getting to speak to a supervisor .
neutral	your phone system is terrible .
positive	this company is professional but user_friendly as well .
positive	the difference was in the thousands .
neutral	i would recommend him to anyone .
neutral	i did do my home work and ordered the right part from parts_geek but that was before i did the $_00 . 00 return
neutral	i decided to order from pet_flow because i read that they accept manufacturer coupons .
positive	book it customer service rep helped_me with everything i need !!
positive	this was as easy as possibly could be , even if you are a novice computer user .
neutral	i am not sure if i will order from this company again .
positive	i would absolutely recommend the lenstore to everyone
positive	so i have no_complaints .
neutral	not sure if it '_s from the package being left on the doorstep by the post_office or if it came from the company that way .
neutral	was slightly better once i downloaded app .
positive	they have everything but not open on weekends
positive	it was easy to obtain .
neutral	i got it after a week also as they sourced one from hong_kong .
negative	this seller even had a dhgate guarantee which is why i think dhgate is backing the seller so much because they would have to give me $_00 on each item ordered from this seller .
positive	i had the rimless spectacles for £_00 . 00 .
positive	a great site for quick and easy looking and booking .
positive	always receive prompt service , competitive prices , great selection , and great products .
positive	however , i am definitely ordering from my own_labels again .
positive	i was very pleased with the service and quality that this company provides .
positive	good quality but expensive
positive	simply_supplements great value for money immediate dispatch . very friendly informative staff all done with no_fuss or pressure to buy more .
negative	still not had a response , and obviously today is 00th_april .
positive	men ellers ganske anbefalelsesværdigt
neutral	that is not the only web related issue though .
negative	it '_s not worth it !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
neutral	my main grievance with flight_centre was when we missed a connecting_flight ( due to being held up by customs with a carnet ) in mexico city .
neutral	ordered right headlight , received left
negative	are you kidding me .
negative	the most annoying part is the scam like emails which they keep sending when your email them . such as " our support is currently unavailable " or email us back in 0 days as we are adding new tools and improving our routines to offer a better support !
negative	not to mention the price on their website is only 00 . 00 .
neutral	we were not comfortable with this and demanded another car .
neutral	in second incident , i arrived after 00_hours of plane rides / airport layovers to find that only 0 of my 0 rooms had been reserved ( though the priceline confirmation clearly showed two ).
negative	why not just compile the patches into one patch that updates the game to the latest_version .
neutral	this was agreed .
neutral	i had received emails from bookbyte confirming my order and confirming shipment .
neutral	i have only had part of the order as the other item is not in stock .
neutral	when i tried to order new_tires a couple of months_ago with another company ( firestone ) i was contacted soon after my order and was told that they were out of stock and i would have to purchase a more_expensive tire .
negative	which says it all really .
negative	i can '_t believe partsgeek put all of this on the customer ; there were way too many hoops to jump_through .
positive	and cheaper_than amazon !
negative	i rather spend over $ 0 , 000 on the exact_same furniture somewhere_else than to ever go back .
negative	although i have recieved e_mails and even a phone_call when i threatened to complain formally i have never actually had the results as_promised .
neutral	partsgeek doesn_'_t offer this feature .
positive	i have not received the laptop back yet , so i cant_comment on that , but the experience was great and handled with respect and in a timely_fashion .
neutral	i guess if i was just a cashier i '_ll have an attitude as well .
neutral	your website is easy to work with .
positive	i have recommended them to friends and chuckled when they said , " no need ."
positive	second purchase .
negative	tonite they picked_up our car . we are on auto deduct and have been .
positive	the first time i had no problem .
positive	these booster_pads are very absorbant while being very thin .
neutral	i ended_up ordering 00 gift_cards and had to put each of them in multiple_times .
neutral	purchase good except for the courier who took 0 days and many chase ups by me to make the delivery .
neutral	then the shipping said one date and half way through was moved out 0 days .
positive	they offer great variety to include toys and chewsticks for my dogs .
negative	this has still not arrived .
neutral	!
positive	the service , quality , and how quickly it came .
negative	do not use these_people because you will never get your parts !!!!!!
negative	for the very first time as a frequent flier -- i missed my flight home .
neutral	the bad : our spam_filter uses " greylisting " to block unwanted email .
negative	i paid for overnight shipping only to get my items over a week after i placed the order .
neutral	did so and was told it '_s now 0 - 0 days .
negative	we were under the impression we were getting a deal for 000_pounds , i am very careful about booking things on line so always search carefully .
negative	customer service absolutely shambolic , whenever you call they will always be experiencing higher_than average call_volumes , prepare to wait a long time , when you do get through no one seems able to resolve anything .
positive	i really would recommend atlantic_signs to anyone .
positive	the products are excellent quality and they are easy to find on the website , usually have what you want in stock .
neutral	but they delivered two bouquets of flowers in lieu of my request for just one .
neutral	however , the manufactuer produces this product in both china and brazil and the item made in china was what i was shipped .
positive	venlig_hilsen mickas , hav en_god weekend :)
negative	that was until we opened the package .
negative	xxxxxx - xxxxxxx xxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx
neutral	what about , simply " thank_you " or no theme ?
neutral	as_promised the order was delivered within 0 days but sadly only 0 of the 0 parcels arrived .
positive	what more do you want ?
neutral	boilerjuice are very clever in that they entice you in , with the possibilities of paying less over buying weekends .
positive	what more can i add to the above ?
neutral	they gave_me 00 days to return the old part and refunded my defective part with no problem .
negative	why don_'_t you first contact the customer regarding the wrong and mismatched parts before you ship them ?
positive	i would highly_recommend batter force to you .

positive	thanks for delivering so quickly .
neutral	hopefully someone there who_cares_about there customer '_s will read this and do something about fixing there support_team because they need help !
negative	i certainly didn_'_t intend to purchase 00_lbs of something that may go to waste .
neutral	of course , these come in different_sizes , but kind of leaves the customer a bit alarmed to see such a discrepancy in size and no difference in value .
neutral	just wish it had been quicker getting to me .
neutral	0_stars is the best that i can give with this experience .
positive	excellent service and fast delivery .
negative	at the time of writing , i still had not received them .
positive	they arrived in less_than 0 week of ordering & in mint_condition with a bonus repair kit .
negative	i ordered a part , it came poorly_packed .
negative	its too bad so many online companies take good costumer_service for granted .
neutral	when i opened the package it was poorly_packed ie no packing_materials around product , box badly_damaged but no apparent damage to items .
neutral	and have spent hours on the phone trying to get the refund .
negative	i then contacted someone a few_days_later to enquire further .

neutral	part is great ( mirror ) ad said painted and showed a silver picture didn_'_t say what color got it and it was black .
neutral	booking the chosen hotel was easy and well explained , but there was some vital address information missing from the confirmation , and this gave the impression that the hotel was in nice , when in actual fact it was in a different place altogether .

negative	these_guys are so bad , they could actually kill online retailing .
negative	box was open , reams of paper damaged .
negative	my advice to travelocity : if you ' re going to outsource your customer_service , train the people so they can actually help the customer without_having to transfer the call , or set it up so any changes in reservations can be made directly with the hotel , because in the end , that '_s what needed to be done .
negative	they didn_'_t take the time to ask which product i was selling through paypal .
negative	how can that be when a day ago she was told you cannot change numbers !

negative	it came back stating that they couldn_'_t find anything close to that price for that quality ( give me a break full price 0_star rooms are $_000 average ) and suggested that i increase to $_000 .
neutral	but both_times the sales ladies were great !
neutral	a year_ago when i tried to order from their website , also had trouble .
neutral	the biggest problem is that the website is slightly hard to use and prices increase often .
negative	they locked my account and at first couldn_'_t even give me the reason for it .
neutral	website advertised fitting all explorers with transponders for that year .
neutral	i ordered the part on sunday 0 / 00 / 0000 .

positive	lightning_fast delivers with emails all along the way i would recommend to anyone
neutral	i booked but had to cancel one night because it was over a holiday_weekend and i was told ( rightly so ) that there would be no transportation running anywhere on a sunday so i sat tight for another night where i was booked and canceled that night with the other place .
negative	only other complaint is the 00_% restocking_fee .
neutral	i would also like to see if a tv serious is still on the air or if what is available is the entire show .
negative	sendo que o frete foi o international airmail 0 / 0_weeks
positive	i will be using this company again .
positive	brilliance shipped them in time for mother '_s day .
neutral	if i were to fault them on anything it would be : 0 ) the fact that they didn_'_t make it clear on the web_site that free shipping only applied from them to me and i would have to pay shipping on the core_return .
neutral	also customer_service is kind of complicated .
positive	0stars

negative	the part still_hasn_'_t been shipped , according to the tracking_number on the lable !
positive	whiskey arrived quickly well_packed and is a good price
negative	this site is not a fair or accurate representation of a business .

positive	i found a new ps0 on the shopto site at a fantastic price expecting their service to be poor .
neutral	but i always have problems using fedex and that '_s what you use , so it was frustrating have to lug a 00lb_bag of dog_food into my apartment .

neutral	i did not receive any kind of notification that any of this was going to transpire .
negative	two months without resolution thus_far .
negative	amiclubwear has good , cute_clothes but they ' re clothes are a bit too pricey .
negative	color and the look of the items are complete off and they photographed items in their best angle , hiding their ugly & unattractive sides .
positive	i would recommend them to anyone .
positive	i '_ve been ordering from pureformulas . com for about a year now .
positive	i hadn_'_t used a meet and greet service before , but were so impressed with the punctuality and courteousness of the staff .

positive	my son explained to me the concept of rebtel which is based on internet telephony and why the calls made using rebtel are cheap .

positive	web - page was easy to navigate with all parking options clearly highlighted .
positive	but overall delighted

neutral	everything was great till i started to install the visors , once installed the 0 came to the drivers_side and while i was peeling the tape i noticed that toward the front if the visor was cracked and had been glued so i had no choice but to finish my work since all the others were installed , doesn_'_t thecompany double_check or triple_check an item before it gets sent to shipping ?

neutral	i was in the dark on the status of my passports for my children .
negative	unbelievable !
neutral	so i didn_'_t think i got a good deal on this hotel getaway .
neutral	straight_forward drive in drop_off and wait about 0 / 0 minutes for the mini bus .
neutral	literally .
neutral	this cost me £ 0 . 00 !
negative	my credit_card was billed and i was robbed of nearly $_000 .

neutral	booking the trip was fast and easy based on the reviews .
negative	ive bought many small items from this company which is normally okay .
positive	i made an_error with my evermine order .

positive	thank_you !
negative	you would think that would be included in the monthly fee which is expensive .
neutral	to not receive a card to state where its been left is a disgrace , they did not knock and i am struggling to believe it even got delivered because my neighbours either side do not have the parcel .
negative	they must be getting " giant " kickback from travel inn in florence sc for not posting negative_reviews
neutral	this worries me somewhat as they may not have the money that they promised me for my iphone .
neutral	i ordered a purge solenoid for my chrysler .
neutral	the sticker i ordered looked great design wise my issue is with the shipping , the sticker came rolled in a box like a roll of duct_tape , because of this all the thin parts of the lettering are wrinkled and creased .
neutral	hvis_det_ikke_var fordi_de allerede havde trukket pengene havde_jeg skiftet selskab igen den torsdag hvor min mobil eftersigende skulle_være klar .
negative	they should have told me before my order shipped and given me the option to cancel .
negative	this time_slot came and went and still no delivery .

negative	ordered flowers , they sent a cheaper item which my girlfriend didn_'_t like ( obviously pretended she did ).
positive	i had a very good experience with purchasing gift_cards for christmas_gifts .
negative	then the black pair of boots i ordered were folded in thirds as well to save shipping space and the folded part on the leather looks so ugly i don_'_t even want to wear it outside .
neutral	when we arrived in destin we couldn_'_t find the rental office .
neutral	the site was great and easy to use , it was easy to find the parts and the cost were reasonable and competitive to other_sites .
neutral	well i ordered trying to save myself some money as i only wear_contacts now and again and at £_00 a box plus 00 admin_fee , i thought that was ridiculas ( 0sight ) .
negative	no true flashing was added .
neutral	i was also surprised by the package that was shipped . parts were ordered at the same time , first one box showed_up , it was huge with lots of air space . i figured both would be in that box but they weren_'_t . next_day the other showed_up in a small box . they both certainly could have been shipped together in the same box . at_least i only had to pay one shipping cost .
negative	we ordered one pair on the 0th of january - they arrived less_than a week_later .
positive	i will shop_here again .
neutral	they were the only parts store i could find with a moog driver_side control_arm for my ford_ranger with bushings and ball bearing .
positive	the website could do with a bit of improvement .
positive	on return , bus is waiting at stop as they monitor flights , so quickly get back to car .
neutral	toilet_seat was awful and off white in colour and not soft closing , then i thought i would look in the broken toilet box and in there was a decent soft closing seat .
positive	website was easy to navigate and the support great .
positive	i would recommend 000_electrical .
positive	i have now used global web pay 0 times with no_problems .
positive	' ho - ho ' one thinks , but delivery was bang in middle of the slot . and delivery guy called me ' sir ', not ' mate '.
negative	i had arranged for my parcel to be delivered to by husbands place of work so there would be someone there to sign for the parcel .
neutral	always had good experiences with shopto never had any_issues with orders , place a sizeable order and get issues with the " payment_gateway " so my payment was not allocated to my order and as such my order was not processed when i expected it to be , however called the next_day and was assisted by the customer service people who processed the order and i received it next_day without issues .
positive	this gave_me the best rates will deffinently be using again .
neutral	whilst away i get a text to say the delivery had failed !!
negative	!
negative	the package i received was in great condition and was untampered with and unopened .
positive	got the code within 0 min .
positive	i couldn_'_t ask for more really .
neutral	the ordering was simple and the price was very good as for the flowers themselves i cannot_comment on .
neutral	i wish that a instructional manual would have been with the product .
positive	listen i just bought a few parts from partsgeek . com .
neutral	i was on hold for 00_minutes .
positive	trip_advisor is the very best shopping place to look for and plan your next vacation because someone_else has done the research for you .
neutral	your clubs maybe but not mine .
neutral	after checking that the code was fine i proceeded to buy another copy so me and a friend could play .
neutral	i have not received my receipt for the purchase .
neutral	i sent it back .
negative	i was placed on hold and finally the line disconnected and the called ended with any resolution .
positive	i would recommend this product to any and everybody out there .
positive	i am very pleased with everything i ordered .
neutral	i was told that we would have to get them and since we were boarding our cruise from rome the next_day we could not fetch them back .
positive	would use again .
positive	it was very stress_free and worth_every_penny spent .
positive	the recipients love the flowers i send .
positive	petflow has_been sending me dog_food , treats and dog litter to me for about 0 years_now .
negative	your welcome partsgeek . com .
negative	i don_'_t understand what '_s taking so long .
negative	i think not .
positive	great service .
positive	love it .
positive	so i found this little gem of a website !
positive	i wish it were as simple with all the leading online_retailers , very professional , with great customer service .
neutral	i needed the part installed now and was not willing to wait for a replacement , so clearly i made the best of the situation with returning the item .
positive	yes , i would definately_use first0magnets again .
neutral	delivery times aren_'_t particularly good and can sometimes be frustrating , if you order a component chances are you need it to get your bike back on the road , so waiting four days can leave you agitated .
negative	set me up for success ?
negative	i would like an explanation for what has gone wrong at the very least but feel that with so much notice for this order i deserve some financial recompense for your incompetence .
negative	post_office takes 0 - 00 ( not business ) days .
positive	i am impressed by the quality of the completed alloy credit - card style usbs at the great price .
neutral	the kitty_litter was great .

positive	i wouldn_'_t hesitate to recommend heinnie_haynes to my friends !

neutral	dog bestilte jeg min bog en lørdag og_fik den først lørdagen efter , det burde nu kunne klares bedre .
neutral	if the condition of your books is important , shop elsewhere .
neutral	thanks .
negative	of course they didn_'_t get a reply i had moved !!!
neutral	because i was on a time_crunch for getting the book i was disappointing that a day was wasted that it could have been in processing .
neutral	et firma kunne kun tilbyde undervognsbehandling , et svarede ikke , og_jeg_fik ikke yderligere tilbud .
neutral	it '_s better to call the hotel after you make a reservation , so they check their online bookings .
neutral	well , call customer service .
negative	they can '_t actually rectify problems either .
negative	i put both numbers needed for account and so i know it was correct .
negative	i called and spoke to the same representative i had originally spoken to , who told me she was sure it was a misunderstanding and that they would be able to handle my return .
neutral	the company who delivered were 0 days late and blatantly lied about a failed delivery , when i spoke to the delivery person their who_cares attitude means unfortunately i can '_t recommend you use this company , shame as the mattress is brilliant
positive	originally we were happy to wait for the 0 week lead time on the fire place , however i then had to ask mike if he could speed up the production , after_speaking with him on the friday pulled out all the stops and we had it delivered the following_wednesday .
negative	is this legal ?
neutral	our bad for not doing a test patch , but whenever it is that we finally have time for this project , we won_'_t be using lullaby paints .
negative	how incredibly embarrassed i was that the most_important lady in my life was celebrated in this way .
positive	very satisfied with website , price and delivery .
neutral	!
positive	my on / off shower control knob broke last sunday and i thought here we go a new showers going to cost me , but i had a quick look on - line and found shower_doctor .
negative	the second one i ordered does come with the correct electrical connection but does not fit with the stock alternator brace .
negative	never again
negative	do you believe or even hope that i will buy another product from ubisoft again ?
negative	place a order and days latter got a e_-_mail saying merchandise was not available
positive	i dont go_anywhere_else .
negative	!
negative	who is to blame ?
negative	i would never buy from this company again .
positive	it is totally memorable and when people open it up , they quickly pass it around to show everyone .
positive	seemed as though i was always having problems .
positive	! would recommend it to all my friends .
neutral	many_thanks
neutral	there so pretty and i feel great with them on .
negative	they have sent out 0 replacements and all had the same problem .
positive	i reorderd my part which arrived timely even_though it was the week before_christmas .
neutral	.
positive	returning it and getting the replacement went even smoother than they advertise .
positive	they also despatch your order quickly and it normally arrives witching a couple of days .
negative	my order was put in on 0 / 0 .
neutral	i bought a pair of zipp 000s when they arrived there were some slight scratches on the wheels and a lump on the braking surface .
positive	i was very happy with the prices and speedy_delivery !
neutral	when he finally came , he just threw the parts on the ground and then dragged them to the door . very unprofessional .
neutral	this was our second time ordering from serenata .
negative	i don_'_t want to pay for another six_months .
negative	after the shipping deadline was approaching i looked at the tracking items that did not arrive and they were returned with no notification .
positive	this is a very good website - i was able to get my aftershave considerably_cheaper_than elsewhere and the delivery was within days - for free .
neutral	sorry i still have your email address on file .
negative	expedia is not honored their prices !!
negative	calling back and speaking to mario was not much_better - while he stated that he would accommodate any cancellation that i may need , his word alone was not at all reassuring .
positive	despite the xmas break they arrived within 00_hours of ordering which was a pleasant_surprise .
negative	it '_s been ten days now and partsgeek will not get back to me .
positive	the item i ordered was at a good price , good quality and arrived in three_days .
positive	i was a little_worried , as i have ordered online from other_companies and i knew i might be dissappointed by the quality - what looks great online often looks cheap once you get it .
negative	three chains sent and every one of them has_been wrong .
neutral	!
positive	i can recomend buying from boozt . com . excelent service fast delivery and no_problems at all .
positive	the food i buy ( blue_buffalo samon ) is often out at petsmart and i dont think petci carries it at all and pf always has it .
positive	i made my purchases and much to my surprise , everything was delivered that night .
neutral	they have some decent promotions by email ($ 0 off , $_00 off ), but it always seems that i spend the same amount with the promotion as i do on other_sites without one because of the higher fees .
negative	i call the anabella , first occurrence they did not yet have my reservation and suggested i call back the following_day .
neutral	i was very excited when i read your ad on aarp and so i ordered , the ink for my hp0000 ( ink number 000 colored three pack & 0 black 000xl ).
neutral	- i have sold a number of things to b_&_h .
neutral	!
positive	i was contacted within a couple of hours to inform_me that the guitar i had ordered was out of stock and might not be with me until the end of the following week .
negative	they acted_like they never saw it before !
neutral	you need to " upgrade " your membership in order to cancel an event without_penalty .
negative	had to put light_bulb in light .
neutral	thought is was comparable to other travel sites .
neutral	postage too costly to return part .
neutral	?
positive	simple ordering system , good choice of packages , and fast delivery .
positive	for all of you guys wondering " can i make my own t - shirts ?"
neutral	local_auto_parts stores either couldn_'_t obtain portions of all of the parts i needed or required 0 week for drop shipment .
positive	great service !
positive	i have used them for countless years , always my go to .
negative	very over priced garbage and very bad customer_service
negative	the whole_process has caused me tons of grief when it was supposed to be a happy joyful surprise .
positive	i have been looking for this part for some time .
positive	he fell in love with it .
positive	i will be recommending them very highly to my colleagues .
neutral	i still have the wrong hood in my shop and waiting for the right one ?
positive	very glad to be a customer
neutral	on phoning them i have got an answer phone which is very poor for customer - client relations and for a caring company !
negative	i ordered a side_mirror , thought i was getting a great deal just found out part was broken and box was open .
positive	love this product .
neutral	items are looking good and i '_m glad i used victoria_plumb just found that trying to contact them was difficult and frustrating .
positive	thank_you , dave
neutral	the problem with booking on phone is a small deviation on name of resort can make big_difference .
positive	the service is easy to use and you can choose when you want the tyres to be fitted .
positive	great prices and fast shipping
neutral	sale item was supposed to be a size 0 , they were marked a size 0 , but they were too small for my size 0 feet , must have been a 0 so i had to return them .
negative	cannot recommend enough to buy your ring at a store where you can visually inspect it through a microscope .
negative	or was it packed by very inexperienced person ?
negative	approved ?
negative	booked online and paid , no_problems and very easy to use .
positive	great service !!
neutral	website navigation : i was able to identify and order the parts i needed with ease .
neutral	i also bought the black diamond plate cowl with matching end guards and the end guards are not quite bent right so i couldn_'_t install them .
neutral	i contacted the company right_away and told them i was thinking it would be more for the money and they assured me the label was guaranteed for 0 years .
positive	the title_says it all , the new shifters i bought were a good 00_% cheaper_than the sale price on another popular cycle website , the product was in stock , i ordered on a sunday_afternoon and it was on my doorstep by 0 :_00am tuesday .
neutral	granted , i can tell what some of the items are and just hope they are what i ordered .
neutral	and they have the biggest selection .
neutral	i have since unsubscribed from their emails as i have no interest in ordering form them again as i do not feel they are a professional company that i would like to do_business with again , let_alone try to order consumable items for my pets .
negative	this was the last time i will use travelocity .
neutral	the website is very good with a great range of products and everything is efficient the only let_down is ups delivery which is poor - : attempts no delivery and they expected me to pick_up the delivery from croydon .
negative	they didn_'_t seem to care about delays or problems as they already have your item so it just felt_like well we are alright jack kind of attitude !
positive	the site is easy to navigate , clear and easy .
positive	you can '_t go wrong !
positive	the so called spare pair are now in constant use as the quality is very good .
neutral	need to run ever 0 / 0 hr had to wait and hr for the next shuttle
positive	!
negative	i have been paying more for his service than my own .
negative	although they did fix the problem this time mavis let_me down .
positive	partsgeek was user_friendly too .
neutral	usually has what i need , website is easy to use , but i get really upset over the amount of junk they send me , unfortunetly if you block it you dont get order and shipment notifications
positive	lovely clothes & fantastic prices !
negative	would not buy from again .
positive	just in time for christmas_eve .
negative	!
neutral	the title said lock and keys but no where in the description did it say 0 keys and the picture looked like there was only one key .
negative	they are amateurs with scant regard for customer service , falling back on an , ' it aint my fault gov ' nor ' attitude .
neutral	i am being honest .
positive	customer_service is quick to respond and are very friendly .
positive	will_definitely be using them again .
neutral	product description was off on the skull lantern . my skull lantern did not change colors and the light was continuiously white and strobed which i hate .
positive	i was very pleased with my order for my suv .
negative	travelocity - is anyone listening ?
negative	ever .
negative	then , i asked to change my flight and they put me on hold again for another 00_minutes !
positive	prior to purchase i sought online assistance regarding the product and found their advice friendly , informative and helpful .
neutral	i could personally care less if he wears a seat_belt , but when i '_m trying to get my car and with the potential for you getting pulled over because you aren_'_t wearing one , it rakes on my nerves just a tad .
negative	first , i emailed the customer service explaining exactly_what i wrote above .
positive	my new laptop is faster_than ever , no more waiting for anything very pleased !
positive	ten out of ten .
negative	i never received any type of confirmation for the order .
negative	next_day i get an_email_confirming my purchase for the dollar_amount that did not match the price with the coupon and was not the amount i agreed to pay .
negative	i have stayed in the past with ok service .
negative	waited all day and finally rang at about 0 . 00 to check .
positive	great site for older trucks and cars
negative	they said i could return it , if i paid for shipping and a restocking_fee !!!
positive	i placed my order onthursday evening and received it monday_morning all present and correct .
positive	the products are the best i have ever had .
positive	i was kept up to date by e_- mail and text on what stage my order was at .
positive	got it in eight days , which was perfect .
negative	tried to resolve it with multiple phone_calls to which no one ever answered .
positive	reliable , cheap , super_fast delivery .
negative	if customers post good reviews , they are automatically removed .
negative	he said it takes 0 - 0 days .
neutral	unfortunately my jacket was stolen before i opened the box :-(
negative	i thought i may of ordered the wrong one but then looking at the invoice , i had it right , they had it wrong but then i spent the next week trying to get it fixed . what is bad is they have no return_policy so even for their mistake , they want to charge you for the return . and when trying to talk to a human , its next to impossible so everything has to be done by email which takes up to 00_hours and it was always on the back side when you received a response . will after several agressive emails , i finally got a shipping invoice sent to me to return it but in the process , i had to reorder the part and pay for it again and they said it will be 0 to 0_weeks to be credited back for their mess up . not good business as far as im concerned .
positive	i ordered an egg pen from amazon in november for a christmas gift .
neutral	the tour is the typical essential thing to do when you are a tourist in a huge city like london .
positive	simple website .
negative	true , they have the option to return , but you will have a 00_% restock_fee ; 00_% of the lens price ; not worth sending back .
positive	they are great . delivery schedules are perfect . one time orders are very timely and the products are great
negative	0 .
negative	if they say your items are in stock , they are actually not because they are an empty company , which when you order the items , they go hunt for you and delay your shipment .
negative	would not book again
negative	there is no contact phone_number for this company .
positive	just great !
negative	i never opened the bag , the costume was plus size which would never fit me .
positive	here is usually open pit lane , but because they keep numbers overall restricted , there is no feeling of a " boy racer joy riding fest ".
positive	quick , easy and hassle_free .
negative	i ordered a mirror for my truck and got the wrong one .
neutral	i '_ve been so disappointed by the delivery that i very much doubt i '_ll return to dfs .
negative	i still have the wrong item you sent me and had to purchase it from another place because of not being_able to speak with anyone live as well .
neutral	fortunately i have super glue so i made a quick fix but i was still disappointed .
positive	very pleased with the quality .
positive	sold my phone online , got the envelope the next_day and had the money within a week .
negative	i had no control over what happened so a a result i will never use your services again .
positive	i have always been pleased with the large_variety of products and extremely fast shipping !
negative	can '_t review because a haven_'_t got the item yet .
neutral	hello ,
neutral	i apologized to him for leaving my shop vac in the united_states .
positive	will use again
neutral	booking online isn_'_t so simple it seemed that i didn_'_t have enough time to type my information before submitting and getting an_error saying the flight was no_longer available .
neutral	the package was also missing one of the memory_foam pillows which are £_00 each .

positive	i ordered very late one night one line and my goods arrived by lunchtime the next_day !!

negative	now i am told they may come in 0_weeks if i am lucky .
positive	much to my surprise after informing_me of the price difference , they changed the sight to accomodate the purchase with this upgrade .
negative	after calling customer_service , it seemed they had no_idea how to book a " lap infant " and had to call ba to find out how to do it .
neutral	my order arrived_safely in under 00_hours , but one of three items supplied ( an oil_filter ) was the incorrect fitting for the car .
neutral	the first was that i place an order and just minutes after , a discount_coupon from pure_formulas appeared in my e_- mail .

negative	delivery was fast . but my part arrived damaged so i refused it .
positive	no_problems !
neutral	i have friends that are avoiding membership simply because of the high yearly fees now being applied .
neutral	this made me really happy considering that i felt_like i was being ignored with the constant calls and no pickup '_s and that i spent $_00 on some homeless - like sweater which i returned .

neutral	the range of sizes for laptop skins is not that comprehensive and there is no custom size option like you can use on gelaskins .
positive	perfect_fit grill for my bmw .
negative	the crown i purchased was also cheaply_made , as is the magic wand .
positive	i have used shopto . net many_times now , i have not encountered any_problems with any of my many purchases .
positive	fast and well_organised delivery .
neutral	they dropped the ball on notifying_me of the shortage , which can happen to anyone , but the practice of giving themselves up to four business days to let you know if everything you order is in stock is not the best .
negative	now i could have sent them back at no cost to me , got a refund and then ordered the same parts again at the new prices .
neutral	maybe partsgeek needs to have a talk with them ?
negative	i complained about this but the company merely referred me to some hidden clause in terms and conditions .
neutral	we now need to purchase stamps and then stick them to each envelope .

negative	i brought a shaft which i was told would fit strait in the head of my driver .
neutral	the hotel was clean and within walking_distance from a lot but the staff was snooty and not to helpful .
neutral	i know it is a older car and much is a general fit and all pics don_'_t match the product that got shipped .
negative	that was only a good deal for me if the discounted item was included .
neutral	whew !
neutral	had to agree to certain day of certain week or wait for the next slot which they couldn_'_t advise when it would be and could be weeks_later .
neutral	i decided to install the part anyway , hoping this would not effect the electronics part of it ?
neutral	they offered a 0 %_discount , but after a negotiation i opted for grips instead .
negative	however , in short i will not be ordering from parts_geek again !
neutral	i got a grill for my car and the screws came out where they shouldn_'_t have , so my grill was all loose .
neutral	i went for the most expensive thinking they would be the best quality but after going from estee lauder and mac to these i am still unsure if i have wasted my money or not .
negative	the price that i was quoted was competitive and so i went_ahead with the booking .
negative	sorry , we can '_t do that we don_'_t make any proffit on tv '_s .( why have a shop full of them then ) then just as we are paying the extra £_00 after a long debate they try to sell us an extended_warranty at an inflated price and offer us a circuit breaker with a pretend discount !!

positive	lenstore offer a quick and reliable service .
negative	oh and the comment on my review from amiclubwear . com support saying they will contact me directly , well they never contacted me at all .
neutral	the next problem was a real problem .
neutral	we drove to the car_park and handed_over the car at level 0 near the lift and were told to collect it from the same place - on our return , we phoned and spoke to a foreign gentleman_who told to go down to one .

neutral	good price on travelocity for the hote . l i like the televisions and clean rooms , and the indoor_pool and hot_tub were a great plus !
negative	my problem is an operator that does not understand right from left , this error should not have even occurred as i ordered a right front fender and your operator sent me a left front fender , so i had the truck driver take it back as it was not what i ordered .
neutral	i love this company and appreciate everything , however , it is very frustrating to deal with the recurring technical_issues .
positive	each time i have ordered , i have received my merchandise in a few_days time .
neutral	my brother has the same phone system but has voip through his internet provider , and doesn_'_t have any of these problems , so it '_s not the phone system or the cable .
positive	yesstyle has that !
negative	the stuff i needed came
neutral	other services , such as grubhub , provide up to date eta '_s via_email and text .
negative	when i demanded a refund , they were not willing .

negative	the flowers arrived in a small box , some of the flowers were dead and some of the flower heads had come off .

negative	this was a very frustrating night !

positive	did some research and found what i thought i wanted - rang gak customer service as they had the guitar i wanted in 0 trims all at different prices .
negative	if i had received the correct part it would be fine but the true measure of doing_business with a company is how a problem is handled .
negative	operator did not reserve the room i requsted .
neutral	the product came as shown / described and met my standards .
neutral	if i hadn_'_t already got a set of tables & wanted matching ones , i would have walked out of the shop without buying anything !

neutral	i bought a number of envelopes as samples as i am a letterpress printer and am looking for the right envelopes for my clients projects .
negative	doubt very much if i ever purchase anything from you again your policy of refusing to offer a telephone_number so you can talk to a human is poor . how can you stay in bussiness the computer does not answer your questions . luis j arango .
neutral	the group discount option gave_me a £ 0 discount on a £_000 order , which is totally pointless really , of course they don_'_t tell you what discount you get before you sign_up .
positive	pneus sont pas_cher du_tout , livraison_rapide mis a part ma derniere commande ou je_n ai pas recus mes pneus ( faute d un transporteur chronoposte espagnol ) sinon tres_bon contact avec le service clientel qui fond tout leur possible , c_est dommage qu il ne fond pas_de bon de reduction au client qui commande beaucoup , sinon quand tout va bien c_est livrer en moins de 00 heures , donc je_recommande se site

negative	lady came back and said she had issues with the competitor '_s site and couldn_'_t see the price ( even_though i could easily pull it on my pc and iphone ), went on another 00_min hold and then was disconnected .
positive	this was my first order placed with country_attire - i was attracted by the quality clothes by quality names on offer and the lure of free_postage and free returns ( in the unlikely_event that things did not come up to scratch ).
negative	very much surprised to note on the video that the rat avoided the poison on several_occasions .
neutral	i like the controller , but the d pad sticks , right out of the box ?
neutral	this i would understand if there was some message indicating why .
positive	the logo company works great for designing a logo at a reasonable cost .

positive	item came on time and as was described .
neutral	good prices , but over a week to receive items is not good .
neutral	the two people i spoke with were pleasant , but not very easy to understand .
negative	there was not a single place that is said this booking was through expedia !
negative	i have been on the phone - listening to elevator music with no assistance for 00_minutes .
neutral	the car given us , although new , was larger than that reserved , which gave_us considerable concern relative to road width .
positive	a truly five_star outfit !
positive	i was really happy with the service provided and the ease of the whole_process !
negative	no refund was offered on the delivery , regardless of it arriving five days after the said delivery date .
positive	i got my item much_quicker_than i expected which was brilliant .
positive	i found a great deal on a storage_space , and more sizes to choose from , at sparefoot .
positive	my future wife_loves her diamond and shows it off to everyone .
positive	i wouldn_'_t go_anywhere_else and i '_ll always work with dan .
negative	however , when i arrived at the holiday_inn , the receptionist told me that i had been booked twice into the hotel by different agencies , room - reservations . com , or some such .
negative	a third order was ordered and dispatched for an item that was originally out of stock - and also never arrived .
positive	i will be using pg in the future .
negative	you sent me the wrong part . you want me to pay freight to sent it back . if you try to call to talk to a person good luck .
positive	can '_t ask for more .
negative	so i made the choice and quizzed the customer_service agency what would come quicker .
neutral	i can go on grubhub or foodler . com and find more options at more times of the day , some with free delivery , whereas you are hard_pressed to find a restaurant on delivery . com that doesn_'_t charge a fee .
neutral	i used sparefoot to help find a storage location for an estate that i am clearing .
negative	if your employee is unable to figure_out the problem , is the customer supposed to go to your warehouse and solve it for you ?
neutral	they did nothing for me as they have in the past .
negative	she processed it and i should receive it shortly .
positive	accurate_description of product
positive	!
positive	when i did a search the pages loaded quickly and i found a very convenient facility at a great rate . the instructions and information on the facility were clearly posted and they sent a follow - up email reservation confirmation .
negative	what it should have said was that travelocity doesn_'_t penalize you if you cancel within 00_hours , but the airlines might .
neutral	my husband had taken the day off work to wait in for the delivery and we were sent an_email_confirming a time period during which to expect the delivery .
neutral	not great that i was referred to the manufacturer when the winter_cover was short .
positive	i had been looking for a particular jacket for my daughter for a while without_success .
negative	i go to return and it cost me 00 dollars !!

positive	fast postage , excellent gear , every time .
neutral	i typically have good experiences with amazon , but my last few orders have been a sub - par experience .

neutral	overall i love the shoes and would order again

positive	not only do they have an excellent selection but their delivery time is second to none .
neutral	not sure if i will shop again .

positive	i use discount supplements to purchase items for my son .
negative	i bought an ab roller from this company ,( uk_sport imports ) when it arrived it was broken . i e_- mailed the company immediately and recieved an_automated reply .

negative	please refund £ 0 . 00 to my credit_card
positive	the curtains are good quality and were made well .
negative	i returned a pair of shoes that were no where near the dimensions of the manufacturers stated pricing guide .
neutral	in all fairness , the parts were manufactured by bosal exhaust systems .
negative	i '_ve learned my lesson not to do_business with these_guys .
neutral	i was also out another 0 bucks i had to spend to ship the wrong part back .
positive	i don_'_t think i '_ve ever had service this fast .
negative	not worth doing biss .
negative	now they can '_t find a record of him again .
neutral	then they sent me a link to a sight where i could print my vouchers and it was wrong .
neutral	apparently this is their policy .
neutral	the machine is great , but then that '_s nothing less_than i expected as my previous machine was a bosch washer .
neutral	i loved them !
positive	occasional food purchases .
neutral	i ' d say i stood outside for over 00_minutes , during which i observed three " parking spot " vans depart .

negative	the next ten_minutes were spent with her transferring me to customer_service ( wait , i wasn_'_t speaking to customer_service ?)
negative	one star_rating !
neutral	not damaged to the point of not usable but damaged none the less .
negative	i will never use travelocity again , nor will my friends or family .
neutral	i had to go out an buy more food ( i timed the delivery to coincide with our dogs ' need ) so that our pups wouldn_'_t go hungry .
positive	i would highly_recommend town_fair tire .
neutral	i have synchronized the remotes per owners_manual - no help .
negative	on our return we rang to find out why the delivery of our car was taking so long and we were told it had gone to the wrong terminal .
negative	the explanation below that communicating via_email is more personal sound a little strange to me .
negative	why could the delivery people not contact me the day before to ensure that i would be at home to receive the goods ?
positive	due to the 00_%_discount as it was my first purchase with lenstore i was very happy with the deal i got .
positive	ordered net_curtain , price was great , product arrived when expected and overall i was very happy with transaction .

negative	but i recieved order there was some accessories missing .
negative	than kindly gave_me a 00 dlls coupon to use in my next trip and i just try to book a room for vegas and guess what ?
negative	no apology for their ineptitude , and my stress and extra expense
positive	enough moaning .
negative	on september 00 , 0000 , i placed an order with 00dollarmall . com .
negative	!
neutral	despite assurances it could be done in 0 - 0 days i didn_'_t receive my visa for about 0_weeks , causing me to miss the first usa match .
positive	i discover something new whenever i shop on sheinside .
neutral	i certainly won_'_t chance it again - back to interflora !
positive	in the end the cards were great and even arrived early .
negative	my expectation of reservations . com is to provide me with exceptional customer_service and rectify the situation without penalizing me as the customer .
negative	( order #_0000000 ) it significantly cheapens your reputation when you attempt to pass off review copies for student editions , and i will no_longer purchase from bookbyte if you continue to trade in review copies that are clearly_marked " not for sale ."
neutral	i was in the house at the time and nobody rang the doorbell to tel me they were making a delivery , it was only when i was going out a bit later that i discovered some very large packages plonked in the front garden .

positive	good products , wide_range and competative_prices .
positive	found this system to be simple , straightforward and profitable
positive	i found the service was simple to use and very transparent .
neutral	i do not know if they were there before i gave them the car , but there paperwork is certainly not good enough to prove they were .
negative	i sent the the original shoe box unharmed in another shoe box ( why would i want to pay for a box when they messed_up ), and ami_clubwear sent the package back without opening it because they thought the original box was damaged and i did not end up getting my money back for shipping or i didnt get the right item .
neutral	no recourse , no cancellations , a lot of waiting on phones , wasted time , and people who could not care less .
neutral	there was no paperwork or return_slip in the box , so after a few_days when i assured myself that had ordered the wrong thing and needed to return it , i wasn_'_t sure how to return it , so i sent back to the website and saw that returns had to be made within 0 days of receiving the item , and at that point , i had already had it past 0 days and now i '_ve been trying to figure_out what to do with it now .
positive	excellent quality ,
negative	but super good at charging you for unwanted travel_insurance and debiting the credit_card as soon as you hit go .
negative	i regret ever using this company .
neutral	the only problems i have with it as soon as i took it out of the box i chipped a 0 " triangle off the lens .
neutral	the time delays waiting for requests is a joke in a modern age .
negative	i googled some of the brands and converted the price to us dollar and found that yesstyle charge americans & europeans double and sometimes triple the original price .
negative	but funny the room that was paid in full they did get the reservation for .
neutral	kavinace went up $_00 per bottle that '_s an insane increase .
neutral	my 0 daughters and myself did the big_bus_tour 0_weeks_ago . i personally felt_like cattle being herded on and off the bus , pushing and shoving to make_sure that everyone got to the top_deck with the best of views .
negative	the order didn_'_t show up until the following_tuesday . i had it deliver to my work address to make it faster . lol i '_m in cincinnati , ohio and it shipped from new_jersey .
neutral	came in scuffed .
negative	don_'_t waste your money buying things through mighty_deals !
neutral	i did not return the parts because the amount was smaller , but i need to have more faith in the search filters than i do now .
negative	not 000_% sure if my problem is with moddeals or the post_office , but when i pay more to receive a package early , i expect the company to be able to deliver .
positive	this has to be the best company out there for tyres .
negative	so i am sitting at home waiting for craig to call me back ( which i doubt he will ) to advise what the is going on .
positive	!
negative	but i '_m no holding my breath , since no - one there seems to care at all .

neutral	the trees i ordered were supposed to be around 0 feet tall .

neutral	we had a 0 year_old child with us and it was becoming cold .

positive	all was sorted_out speedily by jake in ireland when i rang the argus helpline - thank_you jake !
negative	i booked the rental , using my credit_card , but was required to provide details of the driver on booking .
positive	he is certainly a valuable asset for swiss_army products .
positive	thankyou !

neutral	i believe their website needs improvement because they have a good product .
neutral	i ordered what i thought was a case of soymilk .
positive	ordered at 0pm on thursday and was with me at 0am on friday .
positive	it definitely seems as though the staff at one buck_resume are personal and definitely takes pride what they do .

neutral	dont believe that your bathroom will be deliverd in 0 - 0 days , mine took 0_weeks , i had emails twice saying it was being despatched nxt day , it wasnt , i phoned up and was told same thing , the day before the actual delivery i was told via_email there must be 0 people to take everything of the pallat that was put on the pavement , i am a woman_who_lives alone , new 0 the area , so knew no one , me and my daughter had to lift it all of ourselves , nasty experience ,
negative	the payments as taken instantly and i received a confirmation_email of my order , then nothing .
negative	well , after telling him i hadn_'_t booked thru expedia showing him the above mentioned emails on my smart phone we entered into a long conversation about my reservation process and both realized that the entire_process was misleading and unethical .
negative	my first encounter was horrible .
negative	never an answer either way too_busy for the customer .
neutral	both_times the shopping and paying experience were as one would expect , the website was easy to navigate , and even contacting customer_service team was not painful .
neutral	some of the order was sent which was in stock . the rest which i was told would have been in a few_days ago still_hasn_'_t arrived .
neutral	the manager called first thing the next_morning , only to inform_me they no_longer had an available storage_unit in the size i reserved .
positive	it is so comforting knowing that this very valuable part of our family is protected .
positive	would use bathempire again .
neutral	de første 0 var alt perfekt .
neutral	i tried the oysters but i couldn_'_t finish them .
positive	i have referred to a friend , the quantity over price at the store except litter .

positive	i have ordered around a dozen orders from this company and have never had any_problems .
positive	the website is really easy to use , the range of contact_lenses is brilliant and they dispatch very quickly ; i '_ve ordered several pairs of lenses from this site with no_problems .
positive	very eased .
positive	it arrived the next_morning and was exactly as_described on the website .
neutral	must be very careful many bad sellers and prices are usualy high
negative	i didn_'_t know what to think of that but i won_'_t be going back !!
positive	again at about 00 months i was having a problem again so i wrote square_trade and within 00_hours they told me to send it back and they would give me a full_refund for my computer .
negative	they allowed someone to post a review about my company after i cancelled their order , due to a fraud_alert .
positive	found the product i was looking for on the website with just a couple of clicks .
neutral	i also didn_'_t get anyone '_s attention at xtremeair until i asked for return instructions because of warranty issues .
positive	overall highly_recommend .
neutral	the delivery was expensive but it was very quick , the product was advertised as a green river knife but i was disappointed when it arrived as it is a pretty cheap copy .
neutral	it '_s annoying as hell when you use your phone all day for work and have to deal with their distractions
negative	the ups driver wouldn_'_t leave the part with me until i gave him a check .
negative	i have been a bitdefender customer for four years , and was offered a renewal price of $_00 . 00 for a year of internet security 0000 .
positive	they had the best price for the part i wanted , the shipping was more than reasonable , and i had the part in 0 days .
positive	plus they often have great deals , but they never stoop to cheesy hard sells or silly , flashy advertising .
negative	we were finally released to a salesperson , which was amazing .
neutral	online sales_person was helpful .
neutral	after using their service you will get spammed every_single day for evermore with marketing emails .
negative	it '_s been 0 days since then so . i again am just waiting !
positive	claire
neutral	pasyg cheap but coverage only fair
negative	i '_ve called fedex three_times and emailed them , i '_ve tried to be as polite as possible and they '_ve only given me the run around . which is exactly_what i should have expected .
neutral	i ordered a small item before the 0pm cutoff on thursday , but it didn_'_t get to me until the following_tuesday .
neutral	our friends were left at the departure poiont until the driver who returned our car sorted it all out for them .
neutral	this alone made it impossible to complete my repair without going shopping again to try to find the additional parts needed to do the job right .
positive	excellent service .
negative	even if i could have used the invalid credit they gave_me .
positive	what else can i say !
negative	will need to return parts i ordered as the fender extenders you sent did not have the hardware to put them on the truck .
negative	and was told it had been chased up with accounts , and i would be contacted in the next couple of days to confirm the refund .
neutral	i also bought something and a week_later price was higher so you change prices a lot .
positive	i spoke with emma and she could not have been more helpful and patient .
neutral	getting the storage was interested .
neutral	however , i do so with resentment in my heart , as they don_'_t seem to care about customers , have no interpersonal skills that i have seen , play stupid tricks with discount_codes and seem incapable of a simple apology .
negative	i was then emailed to say my order was dispatched .
positive	great service will deffently shop with you online again .
neutral	truth to be said , the product range is fantastic and i am definitely going to order in the future , but i was expecting better packaging and service .
neutral	price seemed reasonable compared with others checked .
negative	your prices although are good , you and all the parts_houses on line and now locally are contributing to the demise of the industry .
neutral	ten days has passed and when i check tracking it still says " order processing ."
positive	only one week turnaround time from the time i placed the order to receiving the products .
neutral	but even a 0x is too small .
neutral	i checked the balance of one of my gift_cards a few_times over the course of a twenty - four hour period .
positive	0 ) who doesn_'_t like the freebies too ???
negative	i will now contact the supplier and request information about the key .
negative	after getting an eye_exam and giving you all of the required information i was told the process would only take another week and a half .
positive	!
neutral	luckily the water had not penetrated the dog_food sack even_though the outer_box was getting pretty wet .
negative	a few_days_later , the charge drops off my credit_card .
neutral	overall we are quite satisfied with the service .
neutral	after an_hour of putzing around with re - splicing connector wires and sealing it up with goop , it popped into the washer reservoir quickly and works_perfectly .
neutral	g & s was a company i had never used before , and since they ' re a relatively new company , i was concerned_about placing a large order with them .
negative	we booked a two bed rooms suite in breckenridge and was told we can change it if our plans_changed .
negative	the interior was littered with stains , was dirty , and it smelled horrible .
negative	obviously , if other shoppers overhear my complaint , and the fact i '_m willing to take legal_action with this company if necessary , then so be it - i can only hope they do hear it , and select loses further business .
negative	i was told to collect the order any time on the monday but was called to ask if i could come in the afternoon .
neutral	i always have trouble_finding bras and swimsuits that actually fit right .
negative	i held on the phone for sales but i ran_out of time after about twenty min .
neutral	if i were to rate merlin_cycles only on their shipping and customer service , would rate them 0_stars .
neutral	i found that the driver had old instructions ( some 0 years ' previously to access the tank by the footpath ) and in doing so has broken the fence which is meant to be small dog proof .
neutral	i was informed that sparefoot doesnt inquire_about rental availability just what size of units the facility has .
neutral	there was no offer of refund or recompense ( perhaps a few extra free_samples ) for having in effect paid for next_day delivery and not received it , or for having to wait a week and chasing the order myself .
neutral	i '_m now expected to pay return shipping and the return process is really kind of just rubbing me the wrong way .
neutral	we kozen voor_een bed zonder elektrische bediening .
negative	so now i am paying for work that i shouldn_'_t have payed for .

positive	i placed the order on sunday 0th dec and it was sent the wednesday_night and arrived the next monday - i had hoped it would have been sent out a day so or earlier to give me more time to post the presents on , but certainly can '_t grumble about that at this busy time of year - i should just have placed the order a bit earlier !
negative	ups received order on wednesday with old zip_code .

negative	eight days have gone by and no product has yet to arrive here .
neutral	well the support people could not answer my question and gave_me this stupid reply that had nothing to do with the free shipping question , so i tried again , and again , three_times and no one there could just give me an answer to my very , very , simple question so i gave up .

negative	i order a starter for my 0000_silverado and received the incorrect part .
negative	and wanted to use it for only a few_months - assuming the lifespan wasn_'_t long because i didn_'_t have a very high expectation on the quality of the purse , since it '_s roughly only $_00 and coming from yesstyle ( i heard many review that material & craftmenship quality wasn_'_t great ).
neutral	the product however looks cheap and is not at all what i expected .

negative	then it turns_out the order was lost . so now nov . 0th they supposebly mailed them again and now am told to wait 0_weeks for their arrival !

positive	order was nearly_half price of any other vendor and was delivered within the same week .

neutral	happy with service .
negative	delivery was a week late owing to the " anti_fraud code " not arriving in the post at all .
neutral	it appeared this price included tax and fees and the competitors price below was the same but did not include taxes and fees .
neutral	this never happened on alamo or national or some others .
neutral	i even checked to see if my email was somehow deleting them and it was not .
neutral	the couriers were reluctant to bring the items to where i wanted them , despite the high delivery charge .
negative	i asked for a transfer of my account to my new address but was told this is not possible & i will have to got through the registration process again ( crazy ) at this point i was approx_£_000 in credit on my account .

neutral	i don_'_t mind a delay but only if i receive updates - had nothing after a few_days after ordering and as i said nothing until i asked where my order was .
negative	no one from the company ever contacted me .
positive	i would also recommend to family and friends not just good price but the way they treat you at their store .
negative	very misleading .

neutral	i have given a one_sentence remark of outstanding service but i heavily qualify that when i say that the withdrawal , without consultation , of the super atomiser shows poor marketing prowess .

neutral	i would not recommend them .
positive	also , they didn_'_t charge for postage and pcking , which is unusual in my experience .
neutral	it freaked me out when i opened it , because i thought that somebody had tampered with the package .
positive	i decided to fit my store room with a series of plastic rack .
negative	they said they could not open anything from a flash_drive ( i '_ve seen them print google_maps directions from their computers so they ' re not restricted in what they can do on the machines ).

negative	so justflowers cancelled my order !!!
neutral	he informed me that my order had not shipped but would get to the bottom as to why .
negative	i used merrick for years and believe in their products .

neutral	this mirror replacement was not an exact_fit like they sold to me .

positive	my items are always delivered in a timely_manner and its great that i can always track my packages .
positive	will try other products in the future .
positive	products were in excellent condition .
negative	then it will be a 0_star site .
neutral	i chose to repair it with epoxy and fiberglass since that was easier than trying to get a replacement so i do not know well they would respond to a damaged product claim .
neutral	seemed like a brilliant idea , especially for someone short on time . no more trips to selfridges to get the pods !
positive	absolutely not , but when a change is necessary i can handle it .
negative	i am thinking you should change from ups to fed_ex .
positive	price was good and shipping had it here in 0 days .

neutral	quad shower suite 000mm . ordered item before i could fit .
neutral	my problem was ( skrill ) the credit_card processing co . did not let_me use my email addresss ,
neutral	in addition , this hertz location has no late hours drop_off , since there is no parking in the vicinity , making it extremely inconvenient .
negative	the chicken i ordered in my second order just didn_'_t come .

neutral	having read all the delivery options i decided not to go for any of the extras so chose a saturday delivery and they added £ 0 . 00 cost to the total for my delivery which i think is not transparent enough when booking and not right .
negative	i spent over £_000 with better_bathrooms and i had to return a pan and soft close lid and seat . the staff there do not reply to any email you send them .
negative	the goods would arrive on thursday 00th or friday 00th at worst and that i would get a call from the carrier the day before .

negative	i '_ve been a customer for over a year , and the rate at which i receive the correct items in my orders is at around 00_% of the time , which is dismal .
negative	the order was also very slow on delivery [ 00 days where the ads say 0 - 0 days ] so i do wonder whether was really dispatched when they claimed

negative	i was given the same wrong tracking_number .
negative	i made a reservation over the phone believing i was directly connected to hampton_inn main reservation line .
neutral	they said they ' d ship it at the end of the day .
negative	the companies ' compromise ' was that they would send out new parts that we would have to pay for , and also pay to be fitted !!
negative	this is a poor way to do_business especially when you want the customers to come_back .
neutral	shipping can be a bit much and isn_'_t all that fast .
negative	not worth the risk even if parts are less_than other_sites .
neutral	however , the part was a good match and , after an application of superglue , fit well on the vehicle .
neutral	the process of purshasing online and paying online went very smoothly .
positive	super quick delivery and unfortunately i had to return the item due to it not fitting but country_attire refunded my account in an instant .

negative	when i phoned back the manager said that the hotel that i wanted seemed to show no rooms available .
neutral	this thing gets in the way of everything , including non_- encrypted email connections .

positive	we have tried them all and only servcorp really cares_about help you grow your business .
positive	will_definitely use these car_parks again
neutral	the problem was when i followed_up with the storage place they said i didn_'_t have a reservation and had to give all my information again and was charged and admin_fee that i was told would be waived by booking it through them .

negative	!
neutral	example is for distance i can see better without them .
negative	then the second room i booked got booked for the wrong dates .
neutral	still recieved the book over a week late .

neutral	i would like to have a reply to my email inquiry asking if there is anything they could suggest so my full_spectrum solutions lamp will be operational again .

negative	they charged me nearly_£_000 for the hire , then when i called up to arrange delivery they charged me another £_00 to pick them up ( i ' d already paid for delivery ) and took a £_000 " deposit " on my card .
positive	came_across the sky_park web_site and hey_presto they seemed to have what we needed , decided to telephone just to double_check and that was it we were booked within 0 mins . that '_s service will_def use again

negative	to prove that the item shipped was the wrong color .
negative	note_: when i checked my unit everything was there .
neutral	the unit is working_properly and has a great air speed output !
neutral	fast delivery but an annoying activation charge that i wouldn_'_t get from a store .
positive	the audio quality is extremely good and i couldn_'_t notice any appreciable difference to a regular telephone service . but on top of that you get all the useful services that voip gives you - overall a killer product .

neutral	however , the sound quality is not always as good as it should be , and calls are often just dropped for no apparent_reason , followed by redialing that does not reconnect the call .

neutral	the pink skater dress is fine great material and stretchy good quality .
positive	i was struggling to get a delivery for christmas .
neutral	it was pretty simple , but i would have preferred the option to pay with paypal .
neutral	my only_complaint is that i had a code for free_shipping but your website would not let_me use it .
neutral	for what we paid , seemed like we would have been able to pay for a nice quality room & casino on the strip with one of the bigger major hotel / casino .

neutral	bestelnummer 000000
negative	what a complete and total nightmare , never , ever , ever , even in eastern europe or 0rd world countries have i experienced as bad a travel as travelocity managed .
neutral	i felt under quite a bit of pressure to check for damage as the documentation clearly_stated that this had to be done at the time of delivery and anything damaged had to be rejected there and then .
positive	i received my new rheem packaged heat_pump from ingram and installed it .
positive	problems - but then service declined to point i left them .

negative	it became obvious to me that in spite of the multitude of bad_reviews on several different websites ( which geraldo was unable to access because of the system that he utilizes ), gerald was unable to help me .
negative	then asked me to send the address .
neutral	first , i thought i was booking through hampton_inn directly on their website , didnt realize i was booking through a 0rd_party .
positive	both_times they have offered the best price , better even than my usual corporate rate .
negative	a week_later , i open an_email from becky saying that she will charge my credit_card additional_$_000 .
positive	love the product and definitely recommend to anyone .
neutral	it took more than 00_hrs to ship from the location .
neutral	order : 00 00000 orig : 00000 arnold kniess received ac suction hose p / n 0000000 – wrong part .

neutral	needless to say i have two door_handles that do not fit !
neutral	we live in the country and i worry_about them when they go out at night . the price was great and shipping was fast .
neutral	the second problem was sending the wrong item . i wanted a dog magnet and you sent a cat one .
neutral	part of keeping a business moving everyday is cost control parts , payments , returns are an every day occurrance and vendors are measured on all accounts .
negative	i immediately sent an_email to petfow who ignored me
neutral	the woman would not let us switch to a credit_card or redo the rental transaction .
neutral	because the seat was so uncomfortable i stood next to the bathrooms for the last 0 hours of the flight !

negative	i got recommended this site from a cousin , used it and started on a terrible foot .
positive	we love petflow .
positive	great service .
positive	this limitation makes it very difficult for me or my wife to sorce some itams we need .
positive	set_up an account , placed my order and the item arrived just as i requested .
neutral	he claims that he is sure that the inside of the valve_stems were replaced , which of course is the part least likely to wear out .
positive	great website .
positive	they have a large range of products too .
neutral	when the package arrived , i discovered there was a " processing_fee " of $_00 . 00 charged to me by ups , over and above my shipping cost .
neutral	also no invoice was received .
negative	[_name ] took the call and expressed surprise that the goods had not been delivered saying he was typing an_email as we spoke to the carrier and that i would get a call on friday_morning to let_me know what was happening .
neutral	it is not one of those cheap - o plastic universal fit barriers .
positive	i received exactly_what i expected - a quality part that fit_properly .
negative	!
negative	it took_ages for boohoo to even acknowledge my returned parcel and then a while to refund my dress .
negative	they were not only rude but not helpful .
neutral	luckily , they had some units available , but not the size i reserved , and not for the price i was given .
positive	the company offers a very excellent professional service to its customers .
positive	i would sincerely recommend their customer_support for guiding me through the entire_process .
negative	checked my email ( used
negative	that never happened .
neutral	however , since someone doesn_'_t know how to package a part , a corner of the lower front skid_plate i had ordered for my 0000 passat was cracked .
neutral	i have nothing else to say at this time .
negative	david
neutral	everything was very good except that the shower_enclosure fitter messed_up the plastic door trims and the shower leaked like a seive and he threw away the instructions .
neutral	in the end , things worked out ok for me , but i ' d suggest the advertising be changed to reflect reality so people can choose other_places to park if a more frequent or flexible shuttle may be needed .
positive	i will shop parts_geek again .
negative	due to weather issues in sc , the flight was cancelled .
positive	" we just received the painting .
negative	one stay at ups and the other returned to ny for no reason because both packages will be issued a " hold " to stay in miami .
negative	not an honorable company to do_business with . never again will they get my money .
neutral	i was so disappointed .
neutral	perhaps i should have read these reviews prior to my purchase ?
positive	thanks petflow !
positive	recommended company !
negative	they didn_'_t even know me .
negative	stupidly have tried again as the price was good and surprise_surprise the item has not been dispatched when promised .
positive	price was good , service was great ,
negative	i have called at_least 0 times since 0 / 00 , and no one has ever returned my call .
negative	after was all said and done i was only credited_back approximately_$_00 from my reservation .
neutral	the issues have been with having wrong items delivered :
negative	boohoo needs to change delivery company !
positive	he was both professional and awesome on a business and personal level .
positive	i have bought things for my personal use and for work . e_mail responses are great and orders are very easy to track .
negative	never had someone so slow and unhelpful over the phone in a long time .
neutral	i feel that your website experience is great and easy to use , i also get a lot of helpful emails_letting_me know when there are specials so i don_'_t even mind the barrage of emails sent to me .
neutral	i could not figure_out how to block an entire area code or prefix .
neutral	few people would consider this an " equivalent ".
positive	we '_ll definately_use bravofly again .
neutral	i logged in with a temporary e_-_mail and then had to search for the company i reviewed .
negative	the prescription / pupil_distance was horribly off , and as a result , i have to take a loss in both a product and money , 0 .)
neutral	0 .
positive	i received my order in the specified time that was stated .
negative	then i wrote again on feb 0 .
negative	mostly i buy online and occassionaly go instore . i am a top contributer for their reviews just ordered summer bikinis - paid and sent for collection at local_store .
neutral	the products i ordered are all good and now installed .
negative	i ( of course ) had it reissued and was assured it would be here next week ( at the latest ).
negative	when ups came to my house , they said i had a c . o . d .
neutral	tongue not long enough .
neutral	also in the e_- mail was a voucher_code for me to use £ 0 off my next hotel .
negative	well , later that afternoon came and went and now three_days_later i still_haven_'_t heard from the company .
neutral	at this point , they are apparently waiting on delivery from their supplier .
neutral	i received a call from the delivery company to schedule deliver 0 pieces of furniture this is after waiting the 0 to 0_weeks as_promised .
negative	i have tried changing the batteries which is a big nuisance in a brand_new product .
positive	great service , prompt delivery , and lovely quality product .
positive	this first order went perfectly so i cannot_speak to their customer service but if there were problems i feel_confident they would be easy to contact and get handled well .
neutral	in the end , the product arrived in reasonable time and a great price , so i have little to complain_about .
negative	i was told that i would receive a certain price for the books that i sent .
negative	but of course it will take a week to get money back and we need our room tonight !!
negative	i received nothing !
positive	officially my favorite online shop for asian_fashion !
positive	the parts ordered and received were correct unlike_some other_sites .
neutral	' alternative ' can mean ' acceptable substitute ' in english , but to german - speakers , it seems to mean ' similar '.
positive	they responded quickly and very comprehensively .
positive	i was looking for a thermostatic_valve for my shower , showerdoc identified it and i ordered it .
neutral	needless to say the people moving your car snoop do not leave anything of importance when you leave your car here .
neutral	i placed an order on the 0nd day of december expecting more than enough time for delivery .
negative	after calling multiple_times not always reaching anyone during normal hours and speaking to a manager i was told that there is no such thing they will not pay shipping even_though i had the rep who stated that three_times to me over the phone , and that the shoes i wanted would be in stock , but i would only get store credit what i paid for them , trick is the prices change and go up so what i paid originally was not going to pay for the shoes a second time !!!
neutral	when i really needed it the next_day .
negative	after not getting a response , i then called the number listed on the site and left two increasingly frustrated messages ( both during their alleged " business hours ").
negative	the one night that we did stay there was because at 00 : 00 at night it is difficult to book elsewhere !
negative	later , when i contacted travelocity . com about this issue , travelocity . com did nothing to provide me compensation .
positive	great service , quick and faultless .
positive	this was easy to do .
positive	b_&_h has great products at a great price .
neutral	new tire was put on and tech neatly replaced space saver tire in well between seats .
negative	( another chrysler_000 had such little gas i had to out it back in parking_lot .
negative	i suppose this guy on the phone was suppose to be a manager although he never formally introduced_himself as any specific position in the company .
positive	bestilte tirsdag nogle bukser , dagen_efter var de her .
negative	your upfront gift_card info should be more truthful and less deceptive .
neutral	my only_qualm was with the way the jump rope was packaged .
neutral	the responses read like computer - generated answers triggered by a keyword .
neutral	the company were contacted , who asked for a photograph of the damaged piece .
neutral	0 of them said sorry look for another place to stay , even when hostels . com charged me the deposit .
neutral	this often puts me off buying certain products where i am unsure what size i would like as i would either have to pay a restocking_fee to return if i order them in multiple sizes or if the size i order is wrong i would have to pay another £ 0 to get another size delivered to me .
negative	these people have the absolute_worst customer_service .
neutral	thrifty is not at s . p .
negative	the hotel agent talked with someone from your service and told them that they did not charge service fees for cancellations .
neutral	at first i was a liitle aprehensive .
negative	the flowers were delivered over a day late and were not the ones he had ordered .
positive	heinnies customer service is second to none .
neutral	otherwise , the broken bracket would have been a problem .
neutral	i have a better_than average credit_score and was concerned when i examined the reports .
negative	that '_s what vegas is for .
neutral	i called and chatted with a reps to make_sure i put them incorrectly before installing them .
neutral	they send you a message_saying you should be able to send the books in one box .
negative	the dog_food i purchase was $_00 . 00 per 00_pound_bag .
neutral	easy to arrange delivery .
neutral	it had come open at both_ends was was very shabby and battered .
negative	i chose the cheapest delivery option but , when delivered , ups demanded nearly_£_00 ' import vat ' & ' brokerage surcharges '.
negative	i will nevet use parts_geek again .
positive	service , price and delivery all first_class .
negative	he was polite and courteous , but it shouldn_'_t take 00_minutes to make a hotel reservation for two rooms .
negative	that card is no_longer active !!
negative	i will chase the money you owe through any legal means and make life very hard for you !
negative	turns_out they charged it and i still havent gotten my money back after canceling .
positive	!
positive	on the pair , shipping was fair and on time .
positive	thank_you .
negative	$_00 . 00 to send core back .
positive	i would recommend no other company .
neutral	plenty of other on line companies give the consumer a 0 hour delivery slot - the oil providers cannot even give a delivery date !
negative	?
negative	when the box came to my front_door it was hardly together .
negative	no return or resulution offered .
neutral	for example , i thought i was buying a kindle cover although i ended_up buying a stick on skin for my kindle and when i checked online there was no sign or information where it told me that the product that i could purchase was a stick on skin and i only found out when it arrived at my home .
neutral	when priceline knows these fees are there , they really need to build it into the bid price , so that customers know the true price of the room , not an artificially reduced price .
positive	just about every year i get almost all of my christmas shopping done with kohls !
negative	so i placed a second order and it said my credit_card was denied .
positive	great prices , and always helpful .
positive	the order was easy to place online and arrived_promptly .
positive	the payment system is smooth and delivery is super quick , i '_ve never experienced delays .
positive	i would recommend them to everybody .
negative	i have sent two email communications and one phone_call to try and get the correct showerhead but have had no response .
negative	still no reply to my emails .
negative	that is not the case .
positive	first time purchase from this store , goods dispatched same day & delivered to me the next .
neutral	when they have things in stock they do ship quickly but they almost never have items in stock .
negative	disappointed and annoyed .
negative	i still have not received the part .
negative	saw two_days_later that i had a reservation for the night of sept . 00 ( tonight ).
negative	i was told a local unit had climate_control units , as well as an 0 x 00 unit .
negative	i was told when i placed an order that the pool_cover would be five feet wider on each side in order to fit over pool .
neutral	it took us 0 months to get our order and i thought it would only be a few_weeks so i got nervous .
neutral	i got the add - on item , but didn_'_t get the food .
neutral	i decided to go with envirofone as_opposed to muzuma as i was being offered £ 0 more for my iphone0 .
negative	total_rip_off !
positive	i know it is early days because we have booked for december_0000 and it is only april_0000 but the booking experience was top_notch .
negative	i never write bad_reviews but i '_m overly frustrated this time .
positive	the warranty sat , unused for years .
negative	i also ordered from them on february 0th .
neutral	note , in april , here are the options : valentine '_s day , birthday , congratulations , and thinking of you .
neutral	i am happy overall .
neutral	if that descriprion was accepted in the search field it would make finding it less of a hassle .
neutral	i was wondering when it would ship .
negative	£_000 down the drain because i '_m not paying good money for organic fruit and veg to put most of it on the compost - makes very expensive compost and gives me a piddling amount of juice .
negative	after five hours , the guy on the phone finally said , " you called us after your pickup time , so actually your rental is void .
positive	my first time shopping at this site .
negative	so two_weeks_later when i ask parts_geek " what '_s up ?"
negative	they were not at all the frames i wanted and ordered , and was assured i was getting .
negative	i asked to be refunded for the shipping i paid for and was told there is nothing they could do for me and i would have to call back monday .
neutral	this person reckoned it was up to each store to order their own stock which i find is untrue after talking to staff in the stores .
negative	even after i went through my books to check for writing they claimed one book that was worth $_00 was worthless because of non_- existent writing .
positive	excellent service
negative	hence i am a little delayed and this is due to :
positive	dogs literally couldn_'_t wait for us to open the package .
positive	halloweencostumes . com always has just what we need for whatever role our sons have in their current theater productions .
neutral	:( still not sure if i get an update monthly on my credit_report from all 0 or what i am recieving .
negative	i lost my money and that is unacceptable to me .
negative	i had to return all items as the quality was appalling for the price i had paid .
positive	i would defintely recommend this company to a friend !
negative	eastern_catalytic catalytic_converter
positive	i will_definately_use your website again & tell anyone looking for parts .
positive	they ' re the best !
positive	thanks !
negative	they never offered to replace the tree and one person made the comment , " how do you think you would look if you got shipped in a box ?"
negative	they brought me a decrepit rollaway which couldn_'_t have supported a child , let_alone an adult ( with arthritis ) and had a high spot in the middle and rusty broken metal parts sticking out .
negative	the form is not very customer friendly and very intimidating :" i understand that a false claim for compensation could result in criminal prosecution .
positive	great as body armor for those times you have to make_sure the taliban keeps their hands off you .
negative	update 0 / 00 : i have finally received my refund .
negative	on the day of my expected travel , my family and arrived at the airport only to find that my daughter '_s passport had expired .
positive	great customer service , great savings , and great delivery !
neutral	found and ordered the part online - easy .
neutral	the part was delivered in a box that looked like it had been hand made out of a larger box , you could see inside because of the gaps , the only packing was a thin bag of very small bubble_wrap , the part was slightly_damaged but i was able to repair it !!
negative	the website stated orders would be processed within 0 days .
positive	these_guys were spot on !
positive	price was comfortably the lowest i could find on the internet .
positive	so don_'_t just stick to the same products try a bit of variety !.
neutral	i believe it was close to two_weeks after i placed the order .
negative	secondly , i found that asiatravel . com offered a rate totaling_$_000 .
positive	i was told i would receive the translated_document within 00_hours and had it only eight_hours after_submitting my order and it was very accurately translated .
neutral	we order some items from the bath store and two men arrived with our delivery and brought it right into where we asked in our first floor_flat .
negative	i refuse to feed my dog anything from china .
neutral	i am returning the dress unfortunately , i really loved the material and colour but is not a size large in reality .
negative	coming up to christmas 0000 i decided to give them another try .
negative	i wasn_'_t talking to a person , i was talking to a wall , and i wasn_'_t getting anywhere .
neutral	ordered 0 led_light for dogs and only 0 work .
positive	this company offers great value and service and delivery are first_class .
neutral	i was also a bit_concerned with the add - on processing fees which i learned about only after going thru all the forms and providing credit_card info .
negative	i am waiting on my credit invoice ( which they say may take up to 00 days ( it takes seconds to deduct from my account so why does it take 00 days to credit it ??))
neutral	not so much .
negative	less_than 00_hours_later after making a purchases , a request to to change the printing on an_additional item was declined due to it had been shipped .
neutral	mine took 0_weeks and i was down to my last can of food when it finally arrived i '_m not sure i want it sent every 0_weeks , but i will let you know how often as we use it .
negative	i waited an_hour on that call and never did speak to anyone .
positive	arrived fast and did the job .
positive	i would like to recommend 0000rpm to other people wishing to do_buisness with them .
neutral	after receiving my order ( which i have absolutely no_complaints about ), they now email me every day - i '_ve had 0 emails already today , saturday , & it '_s only 0 o ' clock , asking me what i think about them !!
positive	every time that i want to search something , google is the only search_engine that i want to use .
neutral	c ' mon " geeks " use a little more tape when sending parts out .
positive	the parts reach me on time .
negative	the sales_associate assured_me i could pay the remaining balance when i left the country , however that was false ; he also told me he would contact me if there were any_issues and that never happened either .
negative	customer_services again received a call - useless is an_understatement .
positive	i had questions , and found answers in one click or less .
neutral	the quailty was like i printed them off my home printer .
neutral	0 .
negative	however , the time actually necessary to return the available credit depends on the specific rules of each bank .
positive	third time i have used gak and delivery was spot on as were the goods .
negative	it was sods law that on the one day that i went shopping , the delivery van called with my order .
positive	no_problems .
neutral	however , i had contacted them afterwards about returning unopened ( box all unopeend , even the original ups box it came in ), and was told that i ' d be subject to restocking_fees and i ' d have to pay for the return shipping .
neutral	young_adult ?
negative	i did not receive the call and placed another call and spoke with another customer_service rep and the call was lost .
neutral	i ordered a fog_light for ford_escape , the box is about 00x00x00 , the box that it was shipped in was 00 " x 00x00 , had no other packing_material in it , huge waste or space and shipping fees .
neutral	the only_downside was when our machine was delivered the driver refused to unpack it so it could get through our kitchen door .
negative	when we went in to move our belongings out of the unit it was only the 00th of the month .
negative	very upset .
negative	the design is such that there are gaps around the seals and the insructions are so poor that i can '_t blame the fitter , he has done what appears to be the only logical thing with the bits available - but of course heatandplumb say it is because it has_been fitted incorrectly , but they won_'_t giive any more information about how it should be fitted to try to prove their point .
negative	be warned : every_single one of the good reviews are from people using their site being asked to post here for " monthly prize drawings ".

positive	and appreciate the talent they hire !
positive	i '_ve never had to wait , whether checking in to get to the airport or upon_arrival .
positive	other services might be just as good , but i '_ll never know because i won_'_t risk finding that out .
positive	a little high compared to other_sites but then again you guys whip them with your prices !
neutral	it should be given to the renter upon searching so we can google map it to see exactly where it is .
negative	jeg_ringer så for at høre hvorfor de_sidste vinduer ikke_var_blevet pudset og_fik at_vide , at han ikke_kunne komme om i gården – den gård som_altid er åben .
positive	it was a good service .

positive	but one more thing i can say is bullshit is how when your ordering on there web_site it says free shipping if order os over 00 thats false no free shipping !!
negative	please_let_me know if there is a special procedure one should follow .
neutral	when my costume arrived the sizing was accurate and fit well but the material was quite cheap and ripped easily so that wasn_'_t great .
negative	three_weeks_later and nothing .
neutral	the process was pretty simply i just had to let them know i was returning the items and send them back via the 0nd_class postage enclosed .
negative	apparently the company was a sub - contractor of interparcel , however , neither the sub - contractor or interparcel took responsibility or even apologised , instead blaming each other .
neutral	another issue is that the escalation_level of customer service is not subject to review by the user .

positive	it was definitely a great start ,
neutral	over all i am pleased with your service .
negative	they sure took no time at all to take the money from my account .
neutral	used takeaway . com for the first time and , up to a point , it worked just fine - the right food arrived at the right time , and we received an_email_confirming we had paid , online .

negative	i am ready to put the part received on craigs list and go somewhere_else for what i need . they don_'_t seem too concerned with maintaining acceptable level of customer_satisfaction .
negative	there was one wall of windows and a 0 foot glass panel on the adjacent wall – behind which is an elevator shaft ( hardly a corner ).
neutral	the car was fine for normal travel , but considering that we were in an area that got snow off and on , it wasn_'_t really suited for those driving conditions .
neutral	europecar needs to stop having so many " extra " charges once you pick_up the car and it would be nice for them to offer a map of the country or at_least the city you are in !
negative	would call me right back .
negative	turns_out you have to use a ticket by email .
negative	and this was an expensive arrangement !
neutral	only to find 0_weeks_later that the sale is still on !!

negative	i called to book a room at the days inn in sellersburg indiana i asked them not to build my credit_card what if it was going to be billed i did not want to make the reservation the customer_service rep kept telling_me don_'_t worry don_'_t worry when i got the confirmation_email the room was booked in the wrong city it was booked in sullivan indiana which is probably 0 or 0 hours from where i needed to be and they had already build my credit_card after i told him i did not want it to be billed and i wasn_'_t making the reservation if it was going to be when i called customer_service they informed me it was non_refundable which is ridiculous because it was their mistake not mine and after 00_min on the phone was finally able to get a refund .
positive	thanks and congrats to them !

neutral	now instead of dog biscuits i have mostly dog crumbs .
neutral	i would expect better quality from zipp and closer checks from merlin .
neutral	parts shipped fast but god luck getting customer service .

positive	the tower lighting makes it much_easier to find things and the huge drawers are brest for salad stuff , veg and fruit .
negative	useless to me .
neutral	i order occasionally from moddeals .
neutral	there appears to be no reason presented as to why this should be .

positive	they are correct when they say that there is no such thing as free_shipping !
neutral	i have to break them in order for my puppy to eat them .
positive	tech friend helped_me and told me of this site .
positive	city_link , however , was a completely different story leaving me in no_doubt as to who i would use again in future .
negative	no matter who you ask to speak to , or how " high up the ladder " you go , it ’_s still some person in india and ultimately they have no decision_making power .
neutral	it said free delivery over 00 . 00 but delivery charge was added even_though the tree was 00 . 00 .
positive	an easy experience to choose from many different whiskys
negative	how ' bout i just cancel it , period !
positive	i have tried several different online postal_services and had several bad_experiences .
negative	asked if anything they could do for a good loyal_customer .
positive	great service thanks
positive	i will_continue to buy from them .
neutral	i guess i thought boiler_juice was set_up to save customers money , but when you buy and pay one day and it gets delivered several days_later available at market prices somewhat lower . then whats the point
positive	you '_ll have to get something for your babies once you look at everything they have .
positive	i would recommend this site to all my friends any day of the week !

positive	back in the middle of the night and car just sitting outside waiting on us again - no phoning for bus to pick us up and sruggling with luggage etc .
negative	called in the a . m . & manager said i would have to go through pl to cancel .
positive	the website gives you the status of your glasses as they are getting done , so you can estimate how long until you get them .
negative	the lead time on all of the items was weeks not days .
positive	this dress is good for summer or winter .
positive	period .
negative	also discovered dan bonsall ( company owner ) had then blocked my ip address so i couldn_'_t even get in touch via website or other means .
negative	they reply that they will file a claim with ups .
positive	like the 0 - liner says . great prices , great delivery lead - times , great service .
neutral	spent $ 0 . 00 on shipping and it is going to take nearly 0_weeks for product to arrive , ill think_twice before using this company again
negative	i thought that i was calling regarding a specific hotel .
neutral	oh thanks !!
neutral	i use hostel_world a lot as it is very good to be able to have a large choice of hostels with lots of reviews .
neutral	i find if what you order is from amazon themselves it arrives fairly quickly , but if it '_s from a third_party supplier it takes a lot longer usually turns up on the last date of the estimated delivery time and that is what lowers the rating in my view .
negative	when i finally got to a person , i was told that the system was down and they could not help me for at_least an_hour .
positive	!
neutral	had the " lean mince " for tea tonight - will not purchase anymore - full of situ and cartilage and tasted awful .

negative	then when we were finally helped , the girl that was putting our information into your computer acted as though she had never typed before . which took_forever .
neutral	but we had to wait up till midnight after a long day of traveling for delta to deliver our skis . and on our way home we were delayed 0hrs in washington_dc for a plane that had to undergo repairs in cincinnati .
positive	i placed my order one day and received my package either the next_day or following .
negative	those screws and washer were not received .
neutral	other than that the item was ok ( i did expect better quality for price but taking off the delivery charge would be right for price ) and the delivery was fast .
positive	great company i '_ve used twice_now - will always go back to them
neutral	but . a day or two later , i called up and asked to speak to the rather helpful and likeable sales_assistant who had processed my original order .

positive	so , we brought maine to us and celebrated summer solstice with a small lobster fest .
negative	atrocious customer service
negative	sad for such a " popular " cd_key site .
negative	that is the tactic here ; for you to not be able to cancel anything , if you do , you are loosing your money and they are making more on you !!!
negative	!
neutral	they have flats in many european cities and mostly well located , sometimes furnished like 0 o 0_star hotels .
negative	i , like so many on this site , thought i was talking to la_quinta hotels when a real nice guy_named brian told me they were booked up but he could find something close by for me .
negative	her_birthday has now came and went .
neutral	i think they should allow more payment installments instead of the two they offer now .
negative	lookes all over invoice and the wrong part number does not appear .
negative	they dont accept returns so i '_m stuck with the wrong part and only one of the things i ordered .
negative	be wary .
negative	i ordered 0 shirts from 00dallarmall . com and normally wear an xl , but the shirts i ordered i wanted to fit loosely .
positive	customer service , if ever needed , is excellent .
negative	i gave up and requested a return order number so i could return the wrong parts and this took days and now i '_m sure it will take a few_months to get my refund less 00_% + shipping .

negative	this has happened to me twice !!!!
positive	my wipers were delivered in two_days in a strong packaging .
neutral	i thought i would receive this service as i had explained that the t shirts i ordered where for a birthday_present .

negative	that night , to my surprise , i received a confirmation_email .
negative	never will use fedex ever again .
negative	as a result , an order which i paid_extra to have shipped in time for travel has not arrived .
neutral	i finally found mr parminder at purple parking who could not have been more helpful .
negative	now i have way more than i need
neutral	just a shame a whole day has to be wasted .
neutral	whenever i call , i just end up on hold .
neutral	to get to the depot will take us a few_days of organising so what seemed like a quick and easy way to purchase these toners , has now ended_up taking us a week to organise .
positive	i searched a few u pull it yards , waste of time , didn_'_t find the wheel for my truck .
negative	i waited for long_periods of time without their answering .
positive	only place i could get my foods to japan at a fair price .
neutral	whilst the prices seem keen , the tonners after the first order the box changed and so did the length they last ?
positive	!
positive	he knew what he was doing and answered all of my questions .
negative	i had to cancel the order , and ask that it be returned to sender and yet they still want to charge me $ 0 . 00 for the non_- shipment by fed_ex .

positive	lastly , as it is a major hostel website , almost any hostel that exists is actually listed on this website .
neutral	product is good but i needed a full arch support which this doesnt quite give .
neutral	overall , i would recommend bookit . com and will probably use them again if the rates are good .
negative	after a week i went to check the status of shipping and find out my order was cancelled .
negative	and it said only 0 - 00 days not 00 to 00 days !!

positive	they looked just like the preview on the computer .
positive	in addition to great deals , we are getting free_samples .

neutral	the cards i did received looked great but i really wish i knew what happended to the other .
neutral	there was a shipping issue on my order .
negative	client from france
neutral	overall , i still think this website offers great deals , and with two kids and a new born baby i can '_t really take the time to shop for myself in stores .
positive	we were able to find an apartment in paris that wound_up costing us less_than half of what i would have spent on hotel for twice the space and service .
neutral	after unsuccessfully trying to download it , i contacted the company and learnt that they actually don_’ t offer the wallpapers for laptops .
positive	!
positive	best price i could find for a ford_focus fan_assembly .
positive	i send them a picture of my rim from a 0000_lexus es000 .
neutral	agree on a price before the work is done , get a written quote and you should be okay !
positive	and the monthly monitoring service is set at a very low price !
neutral	though i would get more !
negative	they packed our cooler and when we got home one of the lobsters in particular looked scrawny .
neutral	once i chose my items , the store credit was given as an option of payment ( yay !).
negative	they are not and do not use given the option - they are no better_than the smaller firms .
negative	the manager can '_t do anything .
negative	p . s .
positive	will certainly use house_trip again !
neutral	i put the book on rush order because i wanted to have to book soon to prepare for the class .
positive	definitely recommend
neutral	i '_ve ordered 0 times now and the shipping has not improved , my last order was placed on a monday_morning and i received it one week and one day later on tuesday .
negative	i sent 0 e_- mails to customer_service .
neutral	i was so excited !
negative	at that time i asked to speak to allan as i was just cut_off .
positive	quick response on my purchase and the product was here within days of my purchase .
neutral	it is still in the box unused and i don_'_t know if i should throw it away or be creative on how else to use it .
neutral	i believe the company is consious about its reputation , but its business processes do not work properly yet .
positive	fascinating to watch the route it takes .
neutral	there was nothing on the website saying that my tien suspension was not in stock so when i finally see that it '_s been shipped more than a month later my patience has_been kind ground down .
neutral	the price has_been reduced for this type of lamp - you do the math .
positive	great inventory of oldie music along with an easy to navigate and use website .
positive	i live in dc .
positive	now our oldest_son wants a shirt too , so maybe we '_ll order it again in the future and give it to him for his_birthday in december .

positive	i was able to make an_appointment on line with no_issues .
positive	i will_definitely use them for all future supplement orders and i highly_recommend them to you !
negative	and then they said i had a year without interest on the bill , but when the year was up , they charged me all the past interest without informing_me they would .
neutral	on line they all looked like regular applebee cards i clicked on .
positive	so so expensive .
negative	shipped wrong part , different from picture .
positive	our labradoodle had bladder problems since she was a puppy .
positive	pat yourself on the shoulder .
positive	their phone reps are courteous and knowledgeable .
neutral	the guy on the desk was a bit stressed and was rushing through everyone .

negative	i had to order a brake_master_cylinder with reservoir .
neutral	first time i ordered a bag of dog_food the bag had a huge slash across the back , half the food dumped out into the box .
positive	i '_m not lucky_enough to live very close to a marbles location ( although i '_ve been there before , and the staff is amazing ), so ordering their new games online is really convenient .
negative	this was ridiculous .
negative	•_“ there is no reason_why you should not be eligible for this offer , and i will transfer you to customer_service .” ( i was then disconnected after a 00 - minute hold .)
negative	( no call for the next hour , i have call waiting ) while waiting i started calling all the florists around my parents area and located the local_florist myself .
positive	we were completely_satisfied with the service from initial advice stage to completion of the tyre_fitting itself .
positive	i ordered some solid_gold dry_dog_food from these people because with the free_shipping , thy ended_up being the cheapest i could find either online or in my area .
neutral	i use travelocity whenever we travel but they seem to have a lot of flight changes .
negative	there no customer service so there no way inquire_about a product . when you order you get the wrong stuff , when you return it you lose money the reason_why people buy from you is because they are looking for a good deal . you need to speak to someone in customer service and if you can '_t you are going to get negative_reviews
neutral	haven_'_t gotten sticker yet , but would appreciate a us postal shipping option !
negative	billing_address
negative	i have yet to hear on my status for the 0 international trademark applications and i have to constantly prompt them for information . i feel_like a 0rd class client .
neutral	shipping 0 large brake_rotors gets spendy
positive	i am so glad i found parts_geek !
neutral	i called the next_day to be informed that one of my items , the least_expensive item ($. 00 ) was out of stock and had to be sourced from another location .
neutral	therefore , i cannot verify it is a new part .
positive	the labels i ordered for wedding welcome_bags are perfect and made my life a little easier .

negative	i had to order it elsewhere and now it '_s late as my class has already started .
neutral	the paper finally arrived separately some days_later after dpd failed to fulfil their delivery commitment ( although dpd did give a free upgrade to a saturday delivery ).
negative	booked cruise through_travelocity because of onboard_credit promotion .
neutral	we were forced to upgrade to premium level to assure an automatic_transmission and , thus , to incur significant additional expense .
negative	you guys had one job - one job . book a room with two queens .
positive	then it makes you review the order and input card info .
positive	i got the short jump_rope and a 00 ft rope .
positive	products were great .
positive	wonderful service , thank_you .
negative	so to send them my old fuel filters i have to call parts_geek and wait on hold_forever for an " rma " number to send them back .
negative	help !
negative	so you send the wrong part , put me through hell to get an authorization to return , then after raising hell for a week you simply say ." oh , just throw it away !"
positive	ordered a wiper_arm for my 00 000 turbo .
neutral	so , overall , not exactly_what we expected and not brilliant after - sales service .
neutral	i had to wait 00 days until i could request a refund . ended_up being a hassle ordering online so will stick to using shops !

positive	these people aim to please and delivery is so fast !
negative	he sent an immediate email .
neutral	i expected that there would be beds ready for everyone .
neutral	i would have ordered more , but the three_times i sent emails all i received were auto - replies .
negative	their phoneline doesn_'_t connect to anyone despite it saying call us if you have problems and you must use the websites contact box for a reply .
positive	i must_say that when i got the 0 different logo options , it was very hard for me to choose one .
negative	don_'_t use biblio .
negative	regardless , nothing happened .
neutral	there was a mistake in the delivery .
positive	they have fast service and a wonderful line of products , especially when it comes to dog_treats .
negative	istedet for at være flyselskabspersonale , mente han at kunne opføre sig som lufthavnspersonale .
neutral	delivery . com gives the best promotions but the discounts ( usually during the weekend ) do not apply automatically after orders are placed .
negative	upon_calling customer service i talked to a very nice lady that wanted to help me out .
negative	mig og min søster på 00 ventede i 0 timer i lufthavnen over natten på at vi skulle komme afsted , hvortil norwegian gang på gang blev ved med at udsætte , på_trods af sure kunder ved desken .
positive	the price was also very reasonable .

negative	becky s ."
neutral	i had ordered the sunny knockout_rose as a gift for a friend .
neutral	the tracking_number i got did not work at all and when you call to customer_service they have you waitibg for 00_mins .
neutral	the labels were very cute , but the font was so small that it was hard to read .
negative	the greenies were so flexible , i could bend them in half , and the only good thing was the bully_stick which was gone in a matter of 0 / 0 hour .
negative	000 pesos in phone charges and another 00_minutes on hold with travelocity , i was still left paying out of pocket with the hotel and not even an_apology from travelocity for promising to have a warm bed but failing to actually make it happen .
negative	i selected the day when i wanted to deliver the parcel it arrived two_days earlier as i requested without a box of chocolate .
neutral	i am not able to determine if the pump has suffered damage until it is fitted ( won_'_t be till end may ).
negative	by undermining our ability to profit on parts .
neutral	bestilte 0 kjoler i størrelse 0 .

neutral	this was a hidden price deal on travelocity .
neutral	i called the airline themselves ( air_canada ) and they were very nice and reserved us seats all together .
neutral	i ended_up giving that particular suit to my teenage_daughter ( it looks great on her ) and i ordered the geo - print racer back instead .
neutral	it was an easy process but for the item i wanted there was no sizing information telling_me what s , m , l actually meant .
neutral	for the extra price i pay for delivery this is no where near good enough , i had to rearrange my plans to stay home that day for them to redeliver .
neutral	enjoy the cds music_magpie , you got a lot of highly resellable stuff for a small outlay .
negative	i '_m very disappointed .
negative	god_knows tho that they have to be out there .,
positive	quality products .
negative	i submitted a ticket on the website to ask for them to contact me to resolve the problem ( their is no phone_number listed that i can just call to get service ) and nobody ever called me to resolve the problem .
negative	viewed a promotion of light up dog tags 00 %- this company used this as gimmick to get you to buy other products .
neutral	i really liked the led_lights we bought for oliver , but the shipping of your products through fedex is crazy .
negative	so i gave agent the 0 confirmation numbers to cancel .
neutral	going to look for a skirt to fit an oval trampoline as this would be useful to stop the dog getting under it when the children '_s are using it .

positive	i can_count on getting good prices and reliable service from travelocity .
neutral	i '_ve used you before for my husband and i but not sure if ill use you again .
positive	goods arrive as they appear on the website - generally colours and sizes are what you expect .
positive	whoever doesn_'_t know amazon they don_'_t know how to shop wisely over the internet .
neutral	i was turned on to partsgeek . com while shopping for parts .
negative	i '_m glad i got my refund , but if the part was not in stock , it shouldn_'_t have be confirmed as an order .
negative	the first box came , no problem , waited several days then the next box came .
negative	a week in advance of a friend '_s birthday , i ordered flowers from floraqueen to be delivered on may 0 .
positive	good value & fast , polite , knowledgeable_staff .

negative	i am retired .
negative	the driver / delivery person was delightful and did understand my frustration .
neutral	they had lousy seats on their first flight and had to ask passengers to move so they could sit together on the second flight .
neutral	steps more or less went straight on to the main road which was quite busy and noisy .
positive	i like the fact it comes right to my door on schedule .
neutral	!
negative	they only price match hotels and not packages .
neutral	also , i didn_'_t try sending the canvas back , because i farm all day long - it '_s hard to be at my townhouse when ups makes their deliveries .
negative	i was broken hearted if that '_s all they had available to the 0rd_party websites they should say so , so at_least the customer gets what the pay for not be told afterwards we ' re going to downgrade you because you didn_'_t book directly thru us not ever happening again will make_sure i book directly next time will probably never stay at the hard rock again .
positive	competitive_pricing excellent customer experience
neutral	i needed those items for a very special_occasion .
neutral	. so as long as you can do it yourself and you dont need help or customer_service your good to . go .
negative	the bumper_cover i received was all scraped up with big chunks missing too .
neutral	the first black_cartridge that i got i will probably have to return as it did not print and no amount of nozzle or head cleaning got it going , so quality was not top_notch .
negative	they charged me £_00 instead of the £_00 this would have cost otherwise .
negative	we decided to return on the river_cruise to south bank only to be turned away as the last boat of the evening was full .
negative	i received the wrong part twice .
negative	how did the $_000 room only become $ 0 cheaper_than that $_000 ?
positive	i ordered the part and it turned_up next_day at 00_pm !
negative	so i waited and finally got onto an online_chat with customer_service , he said it was out of stock so they cancelled it .

negative	i will never stay at another courtyard_marriott and i will never book with expedia , and as we were told , will call the hotels we book at directly because they will match expedia prices anyway !

positive	really friendly people who acted very quickly on my order as i left my xmas shopping to the last_minute !!!
positive	quick shipment , the part was perfect , will use them again !
positive	not one to buy on impulse , i always do weeks of research before making a big purchase .
neutral	but when i bought them i asked that they be sent to me by a certain day it took another 0 plus days for them to come when in all i needed them by the date i said i needed them by which really upset me .
neutral	this is unacceptable !
positive	polecam .

positive	i spent over $_000 . 00 on them and could only hope they were done correctly .
positive	the website was easy to navigate , had no trouble_finding what i wanted and the price beat out my many pet_food stores .
neutral	the process and procedure to have this corrected takes at_least 00_hours and is time_consuming and irritating .
negative	she and i had already contacted the hotel who stated that so long as the guest is staying in the same room and they are just adding the existing reservation there should be no need to charge that much .
negative	i '_m sorry , but we do not have an exchange program in place at the present time .
negative	this is fishy at best , a form to request a refund ?
neutral	ship_sticks did contact me to notify me of the delay ; not sure what the mix_up was .
negative	these_guys sell used , demo models as new .
neutral	i don_'_t know if i could have avoided a lot of the trouble i had just opening and using this program , but it certainly would have prepared me better if i had known that your programs are all written for win xp .
neutral	i placed my order and within a day i was told my payment was accepted and a shipment email was to follow .
negative	i just print at the most a dozen stamps a month .
positive	my only one complaint is that there prices are so good getting to the bargain games before they go on back order can be a pain , as i found out when trying to order dark_souls yesterday

positive	you will look_forward to your daily cleansing routine .

negative	i will never buy from you again .
positive	i only have good things to say !

neutral	but it look like it is a quality part . hope it holds up for the years to come .
neutral	i '_ve flown with flybe a few_times recently and i '_ve always found their flights to be good value for the price .
positive	you can '_t improve on that , particularly as we couldn_'_t leave our house at the time because of the snow but the delivery still reached us !
neutral	it would also be helpful if i would only see jobs in the area that i service .
positive	i used to have to travel 00_miles just to pick_up dog_food !

negative	this is the second time this has happened to me .
negative	item didn_'_t work , so i contacted mighty_deals about a return and was given an e_-_mail address to contact the merchant .
positive	will_definitely come_back again !
neutral	they looked pretty beat up , but it may have been from the box .
negative	so , i called back and talked to some other person_who said that i would have to wait to get a lost card email and would have to solve it that way ( something like that ), and then before we hung_up , she saw that the card actually was not in inventory and that she would submit a refund and that i would have to wait another 0 - 0 days to get my money back .
positive	this was a bit difficult .
neutral	another negative is that the girl nicole setup up an insurance_policy for me through geico which was nice but she also setup automatic withdrawals from my acct without my permission ( i found that out the next_day when i received an_email from geico ) & i had no_idea what my deductible is & still trying to find out this info 0 days_later .
neutral	received bookcase promptly and with excellent customer_service ( a courtesy phone_call prior and after delivery ).
positive	recommended !

positive	they put me to ease right_away .
positive	thank_you somuch , once again !
neutral	i purchased my ticket online taking_advantage of the discount .
positive	unpacking was easy as was fitting the handles on the doors and drawers and fixing the shelves .
negative	if you order there is no way to contact the company to cancel or change an order .
neutral	it was the opposite they made me wait over an 0hr for a 00 minute job .
negative	such a disappointment .
negative	cancellation was easy but i do not trust this service .
negative	then he kept trying to upsell me to a suburban .
negative	who would have thought a zero would be used in a post_code , it is not like we have number zero oxford road for example !
positive	i always look at b_&_h before i buy any camera / computer related product .
negative	i remain unclear on why this was an_issue but agreed to have the part shipped to my address and reordered and paid with the guy on the phone .
positive	i have the greatest confidence in their on - line system and it always seems that the parts show up faster_than i expect .
negative	but , surprise_surprise , when i log on to the website , there is no option to submit a gas reading , and when i phone the automated meter_reading line , i get the message " we ' re not quite ready for your gas reading yet ".
negative	000 - 000 - 0000
neutral	i had booked 0 places in the last month .

neutral	but , for communication , i would rate it 0_star .
neutral	then i ordered another line .
negative	you stole my email address and signed me up for an account without my permission .
negative	bookit charged my card $_000 and did not tell me there was any additional_charges whatsoever .
negative	!
neutral	i feel it took to long for the book to arrive compared to other company '_s i have rented from .
positive	parts_geek did what they said they would and when they said it would .
negative	it is cheaper to set fire to your money - even with the price of petrol these days .
positive	in addition to pricing they '_ve always shipped promptly , without_any unreasonable delays when they '_ve needed to contact my vet .

positive	highly_recommended .
negative	oooo my god !
neutral	on arrival back to newark i called the number and eventually a van came , i believe they waited to send it until other people expected from the same flight got their luggage and also called .
neutral	it doesn_'_t mean dell provides the u . s . government a quality product because they don_'_t , it just means they sell alot of lemons to the government .
negative	it was not a good experience for me .
negative	also , have your customer service reps begin the conversation with customers by telling them you ' re an independent booking agency with corporate offices ( utah ) with no affiliation with the hilton corporation .
neutral	i sent both pairs of glasses back and put 0 note in with a prescription attached as well as put post it notes on both pairs of glasses explaining what to do ( return the brown ones , put frames into the blue ones ).
negative	charged for parts they didn_'_t send and have tried for many days to reach them .
positive	the charm i ordered was so such lovely quality , and so pretty and it arrived the next_day !
neutral	i get these to crunch over my dogs food .
neutral	only_thing about my most_recent order is that i was sent the wrong part .
neutral	your prices are competitive and the free_shipping is very helpful .
neutral	the food was terrible .
positive	they sell both high_quality and cost_effective parts .
neutral	overall the product was amazing , tastes wicked , best have it after a hard core workout , absorbs very quickly in ur body , no side_effects .
neutral	as long as you ' re not in a hurry they have some of the best prices .
neutral	they guaranteed / assured me that it was .
positive	i thank_you for this product and will for sure order other products from you when needed .
negative	lyft sucks and their drivers are no better_than the nigerian gypsy cabs that roam around seattle .
neutral	some of the items i ordered were great a sink that seems good as not come out of box yet and a tap which is lovely quality also nice toilet_seat .
negative	the only communication is sketchy at best and you have to open up a trouble call to communicate with them .
positive	i tried bondara after my disappointment with ann summers .
negative	i told them that their customer_service was horrible because first , i get an_email receipt totaling $_00 more than more then what the subtotal and the extras were ( which were $ 0 . 00 ), then they tell me the item was shipped on june_00th but i never received an_email indicating it was shipped , or even a tracking_number .
negative	so off i go again back to the call_centre to re - place my order .
positive	i ordered a new screen for my son '_s laptop .
negative	det_er simpelthen for dårligt .
negative	very disappoint and have lost trust in wowcher , how the deals are structured and advertises .
negative	i was given imagine park as the cheapest n i booked with them .
negative	then things went down_hill from there .
negative	they actually are a piece of crap that i paid allot of money for .
negative	avoid this company
positive	i ' d strongly to anyone and everyone .
neutral	then on the final page there was no free option .
neutral	i ordered two_pairs of shoes and some earrings . i would have given 0_stars except some stones fell_off the shoes the first time i put them on .
positive	as i ordered these glasses on the internet for the sake of value - shopping , i don_'_t suppose i have any ground to criticize their full emersion in the global economy .
positive	often auto mechanics have told me parts are no_longer available for my 0000_saab 0 - 0 , or are so rare that the prices are unreasonable .
neutral	the company is refunding me $_00 .
neutral	the first time i ordered from petflow i was pleased with the promptness of the delivery .
neutral	the system requirements for these services list only windows operating_systems .
