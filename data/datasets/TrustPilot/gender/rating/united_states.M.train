negative	when i adressed supreme travel they just said that it was not their problem .
negative	they were also extremely late to send us our tickets / wouchers , i had to ask for them several_times before we got them just a few_days before departure
negative	undgå at_bestille noget_som_helst fra det svenske firma maacann .
negative	d . 0 / 0 bestilte jeg noget naturmedicin , og pengene blev straks trukket fra_min konto .
negative	omkring d . 00 / 0 havde_jeg intet_hørt fra firmaet , og kontaktede derfor udbyderen af_den deal , jeg_havde købt .
negative	efter nogle dage , kom der besked fra maacann om , at varerne ville_blive afsendt inden næste week - end ( ca .
negative	0 / 0 ) søndag d . 0 / 0 kom der en mail om , at varerne vil blive afsendt på tirsdag , altså over en måned efter , at de var bestilt_og betalt !!

negative	jeg_bestilte pr 0 / 0 en deal hos lapni .
negative	pengene blev omgående trukket fra_min konto , men i skrivende stund ( 00 / 0 ) har_jeg endnu ikke fået mine_varer , - og_jeg_har intet_hørt fra lapni !
negative	jeg_har prøvet at ringe , og kom efter lang tids venten igennem til_en kvinde , der kun talte engelsk , og hun kunne desværre ikke hjælpe_mig !

negative	picked_up car in santiago , chile .
negative	econorent made me pay an_additional obligitory insurance which came to 000 us dollars on a 000 dollar rental .
negative	had no choice even_though i was declining the collision insurance , which is covered by my credit_card .
negative	also had to post a 0000 dollar bond on the car at time of rental , which was returned when car was returned .
negative	if its obligatory , they should have told me in advance , and i would have gone with a different company .
negative	dont use argus !
negative	i looked up the ritz carlton in half moon bay and dialed the number from the web_site .
negative	i spoke to a reservation agent and informed him of some details regarding a group i was with and the negotiated price .
negative	he dismissed that and lead me to believe i was speaking with an agent trc hotel .
negative	the confirmation came via_e_-_mail that looked like a ritz carlton message with a much higher fee than i was supposed to pay , almost double the amount .
negative	the confirmation number did not match that of the hotel .
negative	i had to make a new reservation with the hotel and cancel the first one .
negative	cancellation was easy but i do not trust this service .
negative	i would not use this service again !
negative	pc
negative	i ordered a side_view_mirror and the piece delivered to me wasn . t the correct mirror for my car .
negative	i sent them an_email last_week and i haven_'_t heard from them yet .
negative	i made a booking and day before my checkin they send out a mail telling , no rooms are available and forced to go for a hotel of their choice .
negative	since i was running out of time , i agreed for the same .
negative	there comes the surprise part ; they started trying to debit money from my card again and again .
negative	fortunately my bank declined the transactions and informed me about the same .
negative	after that when i send an_email regarding the same , no response until i call their uk office .
negative	in the response they wont address the query , instead they mention only the booking details .
negative	even i am not be able to cancel the same .
negative	no more relationship with these_idiots .
negative	so i purchased a card to use as a gift for a member of our gaming guild , and thought i ' d use our guild collective cash to purchase this via our paypal_account .
negative	so pcgamesupply originally approved the transaction and provided me with a code , and everything was good to go .
negative	when our guild - member went to redeem the card it didn_'_t work , so i logged back in to check the card number , and they had declined the transaction , and revoked the card number .
negative	i was committed to the gift at that point in time , so i provided them with my own paypal information so as not to leave my guild - mate hanging .
negative	when i went back a few_days_later i noticed although they had declined the original transaction , they had still charged our paypal_account .
negative	i then opened a ticket to have our account refunded .
negative	they claimed they refunded it , despite the fact they obviously had not , and i offered to prove this by showing them our paypal statement , their obviously off - shored representative closed the ticket , and as i found out later then permanently disabled my account .
negative	i see how this company does business and i would caution anyone_else from throwing your money away with them .
negative	damn you parts_geek !
negative	totally incompetent , refusal to answer twice when phoning them , refusal to phone me twice when i requested in an e_-_mail .
negative	still don_'_t have correct part sent to me .
negative	parts_geeks are a son of a bitch and i '_ll tell all my friends .
negative	twice they sent the wrong part when ordering a lr outer door_handle for a ' 00 corolla .
negative	( twice they sent the passenger rear side handle instead .
negative	the charged me for their mistakes !!!!
negative	!
negative	lousey , very lousey customer service , bastards , rotten bastards .
negative	your c . e . o .
negative	is a bastard for promoting and allowing this !
negative	when i tried to make a change in my reservation the experience was nightmarish .
negative	finally i cancelled it entirely and made my reservation directly with the facility desk .
negative	i will avoid expedia from now on .
negative	hi i have just found out that the parcel which was supposed to be collected today was not collected , on the order it stated to be collected between 00 am & 0 :_00pm , the collection driver put a ticket through the door at 00 am , why tell me that the parcel will be collected between 00 & 0 : 00 and then come an_hour before the stated time ?????
negative	? for that the reason i am going to rate you with zero !
negative	they send out the wrong prescription and have ignored any emails that i sent them to resolve this issue .
negative	then had the cheek to send me and email_asking me to review the shopping_experience .
negative	avoid !!!
negative	!
negative	sent me the wrong part no way to call and contact you .
negative	you have a ticket system that states we will hear from you within 00 to 00_hours which is a lie .
negative	it has_been 0 days and still no response .
negative	after_reading your policy on returns i have to pay to ship a part back do to your mistake of sending the wrong part .
negative	i have had a terrible expeience .
negative	still have not received the order that i placed and there seems to absolutely no means of contact with you .
negative	please trace and have the wheel delivered or refund my money .
negative	how come you have no phone contact information .
negative	youe wbesite does not allow a customer to fill_out a request opr complaint .
negative	the website disappears as soon as you click the customer page .
negative	i will make a big_deal of this if this turns_out to be a fraud .
negative	i should have known that the prices were too good to be true .
negative	after you go through multiple phone_calls and emails to get them to place your order and after you '_ve paid in full and then after you receive your first and only notice that if you cancel , they will keep a full 00_% of your money ( which is illegal in certain states ), then they tell you about all these hidden_charges for your artwork .
negative	you get no_explanation of exactly_what has to be done or why , you are just told that they won_'_t process your order until you agree to pay more .
negative	the amount isn_'_t even specified .
negative	this was my first order and will_definitely be my last .
negative	i don_'_t deal with dishonest , rude people .
negative	don_'_t order from this company .
negative	they don_'_t know what they are doing or they don_'_t care .
negative	i '_m not sure which .
negative	i ordered an antenna and they " numbered the wrong part as my part " then charged me to send back the wrong part .
negative	i had to pay for their mistake !!
negative	i ordered from another company .
negative	do not order from them unless you have lots of extra money to pay for their mistakes .
negative	don_'_t be misled by their low_prices !!
negative	i invite them to respond to this review .
negative	no customer service !
negative	!
negative	i wasn_'_t able to make my flight home for the holidays .
negative	i thought i ' d at minimum be granted an exchange for equal miles or allowed some compensation for my money , however this isn_'_t so .
negative	no exchange was allowed , no refund allowed , and no compensation in any way was permitted .
negative	i '_m done with travelocity .
negative	i was trapped by winter_storm daz , or whatever they called it , last_week .
negative	i had booked 0 one way flights through travelocity on american_airlines .
negative	american_airlines fulfilled the flights through us air .
negative	us air canceled and rebooked flights twice , finally rebooking on united_airlines for one of the 0 desitinations .
negative	united canceled and rebooked me on a flight that got me to an interim destination after i was to return home from that interim destination .
negative	i now had 0 parties in play to sort out the mess - travelocity , american_airlines , us airlines , and united airline .
negative	expecting that only travelocity could work with all of the parties to get to a reasonable outcome .
negative	the travelocity rep i called told me that since the flight was on american and had been fulfilled throught us air , then interlined to united , that i needed to work with all of them to sort out the mess .
negative	" we can '_t do anything for you ," was their final comment .
negative	american_airlines was by_far the most helpful of any of the parties in assisting_me to get to my interim destination .
negative	travelocity was useless .
negative	in the future , i will book flights directly with the airlines and will not use an intermediary such as travelocity .
negative	paul archer
negative	i signed on not knowing that i was being charged a monthly_fee .
negative	to be honest , i do not recall agreeing to pay for anything .
negative	they do not let you cancel on line , you have to call them .
negative	i feel so cheated .
negative	what they are doing cannot be legal !
negative	i '_m so mad right now .
negative	ordered 0 books over two_weeks_ago and third book is still not here .
negative	their team seems not to care .
negative	no way to contact them via phone .
negative	i would recommend to all to stay far away from this company .
negative	yes they returned my money .
negative	big_deal !
negative	i had to rush a book from another company so that she wouldn_'_t fail her class .
negative	the book and the shipping cost me 0x '_s as much as they refunded .
negative	if their book would have been here as_promised we would not be having this discussion .
negative	i don_'_t think so ...
negative	i ordered front and rear_wiper_blades .
negative	the front box was open when it arrived .
negative	the passenger_side plastic clip was missing .
negative	no customer service number to call , had to use website -- no selection for missing part , only return .
negative	so i selected return , put a full discription with in the comment field .
negative	i then recieved 0 - 0 emails saying return the part and pay shipping .
negative	my guess is fully automated or read by someone that could care less .
negative	my next order will be with a company that has a set of ears somewhere in the customer service department .
negative	very poor service and will not do_business here again .
negative	the parts that partsgeek sells are the cheapest of the cheap .
negative	so_far all of the mechanical parts that i have put on my car and truck had to be replaced with in six_months .
negative	the hub assy on my car lasted six_months .
negative	i replaced the cv shaft and hub assy on my truck and less_than 0 months later the cv shaft broke and that also messed_up the hub assy .
negative	i thought something wasn_'_t right with the cv shaft when i put it in .
negative	it didn_'_t swivel very easy .
negative	it was to get the bolt_holes to line up .
negative	the part that really sucks is that parts_geek will not pay shipping cost to send the parts back .
negative	it would cost me almost $_00 . 00 to ship back one cv_axle and hub assy and you still don_'_t know if you '_ll get your original money back .
negative	i just went to my local parts store and got the new parts .
negative	you don_'_t save any money going with the cheap crap parts_geek sells .
negative	i will never buy or tell anyone_else to buy parts from parts_geek again .
negative	flyer i got in mail says free shipping in four places !!
negative	also 00_%_off !
negative	!
negative	not true !
negative	little star in sub - readable print on back side says after $_00
negative	and nowhere does it say you have to order a certain_amount to get 00_%_discount !
negative	this is an insult and you should refund my money !
negative	where is the trust ?
negative	regards ,
negative	purchased a radiator .
negative	website stated that it was a match for my car .
negative	it was not .
negative	could not reach them on phone .
negative	they still have not responded to my request for return .
negative	it has_been 0 days .
negative	it will not run in any case ... i need help
negative	after i went into your site and looked at your products ,
negative	the most of them were pretty good , except the response time i got
negative	from you all !
negative	i had placed an order from you and it did say there would be a 00 hr .
negative	reply time ?
negative	and then it were a whole dam weeks time before it were even prosed , that pissed me off very dam quick !
negative	you all added to my c - card right then and took a week to get it after i had to write and see where the product was !
negative	now its time to use them in which if i liked them i were going to order more , so if i got to go threw the b . s .
negative	like that again --- forget it !
negative	your package bee prices are out of site and that really burned me up -- so now i will look further for package bees and i do buy a lot of them ... and you all did not reply to any questions i asked before buying any thing at all !
negative	ho_acquistato una borsa di gucci dal sito fashionqueen . net , credendo fosse originale come dichiarato limpidamente dal sito .
negative	succede che , dopo averla acquistata , una borchietta della borsa cede .
negative	sicche ' mi reco da un punto vendita gucci , e chiedo la riparazione .
negative	il punto vendita prende in carico la_mia borsa , e dopo qualche settimana ricevo telefonata dal customer care gucci che , nell ' imbarazzo piu totale , mi comunica l ' impossibilita ' di riparare la_mia borsa poiche ' si tratta di_un falso .
negative	chiedo cortesemente di inviarmi lettera ove si evince quanto detto telefonicamente e mi metto in contatto col sito per chiedere il rimborso della borsa .
negative	in prima battuta ricevo le indicazioni su come effettuare il reso , e in secondo luogo chiedo info per quanto concerne il_mio iban .
negative	invio la borsa al mittente , e da quel momento , buio piu totale .
negative	il bonifico non e ' mai arrivato , nessuno si preoccupa di rispondere alle mie email e quindi siamo di fronte ad_un truffa bella e buona .
negative	un ' esperienza pessima , se non volete essere presi in giro , non azzardatevi a comprare da questo vergognoso sito !
negative	!
negative	your salespeople are very nasty .
negative	i ordered a replacement part for my audi grille and they sent me a sideview_mirror for a pick_up truck .
negative	no one answers the phone when you call them .
negative	they finally agreed to refund my money a week_later , but they refuse to refund the shipping cost even_though it '_s 000_% their fault .
negative	no offer from them to send me the correct part that i actually ordered .
negative	they scammed me out of $_00 for bogus shipping charge for something i didn_'_t order .
negative	i opened a dispute with my credit_card company and hopefully i will get my money back .
negative	partsgeek , you suck !
negative	i had been hosting successfully for about 00 months with airbnb ... i even hosted one of the founders nathan without knowing at the time .
negative	about 0_weeks_ago , i stopped being notified in my email of instant bookings .
negative	i had to go online to see my calendar and almost overlooked bookings that used to be automatically sent to me .
negative	i hadn_'_t changed anything .
negative	i contacted airbnb and it took a couple of support people to figure_out and fix , but after that i stopped getting contacted altogether .
negative	two people contacted me privately through my own website ( which refers guests to book using airbnb ), to say that they wanted to stay but airbnb said my listing had been removed .
negative	no one informed me that my listing was removed .
negative	i left several support emails to airbnb last night after a former guest contacted me to say she tried to book again but my listing was removed .
negative	then i texted with live " chat " and andre f . told me he '_s get right on it .
negative	0 hours_later another potential guest called me to say they wanted to come this weekend but airbnb showed that my listing was removed .
negative	this time i phoned airbnb emergency support and was told the same thing .
negative	they would try to figure_out why my listing wasn_'_t showing up -- not even to them .
negative	he said he would raise it up in the level of importance but still , i have not heard back from them and my site is not showing up .
negative	if they removed it , they should tell me first , and tell me why ?
negative	i have had over 000 positive_reviews and often tell potential guests who find me through other_sources to please use airbnb to book , but now i '_ll reconsider .
negative	this is my business , and i '_m angry that they have not helped_me with this issue .
negative	warning !
negative	trustpilot will allow competitors to write_reviews good or bad about your !
negative	00 days now and review still not removed !
negative	you sent the wrong part and it has_been a pain to work with you or trust the return process .
negative	i have not return it because it just may not be with my time and i don_'_t understand if i will get full credit for your mistake
negative	sent money to a villa owner ... and its been a week and his bank hasn_'_t recieved the cash .
negative	not very impressed
negative	i bought a inside fender cover for a 00 integra that did not have the correct fit .
negative	it was to big and the holes did not match up .
negative	i am now out $_00 . 00 .
negative	for something that is know in my trash .
negative	ordered a0 cardone power_steering pump for cl000 last month , after 0 days they just send email for refund with no explaination , called about 0 times , each time on hold for 00_minutes then the system disconnects .
negative	item contined to show in stock on their website , so i ordered again last_week , this time only took 0 days to get the refund email , again with no explaination
negative	timing of this email sucked !
negative	they are extremely over priced on shipping which makes the products not any less_expensive than anywhere_else .
negative	and most of the products i '_ve received are clamped up powders and out of date .
negative	if the order is even correct at all .
negative	ordered from them took 0 days to get them to claim my info was wrong , 0 more days to finally send me the key which didn_'_t work .
negative	money refund is in progress and hopefully it '_ll be the only_thing they get right .
negative	would not buy from again .
negative	this is a message we received from our customer , to whom we gave a gift_card from your company :
negative	fyi : i finally had an opportunity to use the gift_card i won on owner listens last month !!
negative	!
negative	unfortunately , when i attempted to use it a second time and it was declined .
negative	the first use was in the amount of $_000 . 00 and the second attempt was for gasoline .
negative	i contacted the gift_card company you use and they informed me that my balance was -$ 00 !!!!
negative	that right , negative $_00 .
negative	the hotel i used the card at and the gift_card company both denied any responsibility or wrong doing ,,, i even had a conference call between the hotel and the gift_card company .
negative	that call took place two_days ago and my hotel stay was over 00 days ago .
negative	with that said , the problem has not been resolved and the gift_card company continues to provide horrible customer service .
negative	they are rude , unprofessional and do not keep their word to return calls , resolve_issues or even speak politely .
negative	today i spoke with , " kelly " who claimed to be a customer service super visor with the gift_card company .
negative	she was was rude but at_least gave_me an authorization_number for my mystery charge .
negative	although she could not explain how and why a negative balance can be reached on a gift_card .
negative	i ordered five items and paid_extra for a two day shipping .
negative	i received three in items in two_days , and the other two four
negative	days_later .
negative	i will never do_business with this people .

negative	when agreeing with proof i felt blind in the fact that the bits i wanted highlighting with the uv spot overlay where covered in yellow , there needs to be one showing with the spot overlay and another without .

negative	you guys are the worst with customer service no call_backs or a phone_number

negative	i been buying from parts_geek for more then 0 years , and the longer the are in business
negative	the worst the get .
negative	so much for costumer support .
negative	i ordered a radiator on monday and received it friday , that part went well .
negative	i tried to call the company 0 times to ask for a order number to track my purchase .
negative	i never received any type of confirmation for the order .
negative	no one ever answered the phone .
negative	i used the inquiry form on the website .
negative	no respone to my inquiry .
negative	i tried to send another restating my request in a different manner .
negative	you are only allowed to one inquiry .
negative	i wish i could operate a business where i could totally ignore the customer and he could only complain once .
negative	i was just about to dispute the charge on my credit_card when the radiator arrived .
negative	never order again !
negative	i had a very hard time understanding the woman .
negative	her english was broken and i had to repeatedly ask her to restate what she had just said .
negative	there was numerous_times when i had to ask her to phonic spell the words .
negative	on sat i purchased a part for about $ 0 . 00 .
negative	i needed it right_away so i paid almost $_00 . 00 for overnight air delivery .
negative	i have yet to receive the part and believe i should be refunded the express shipping cost .
negative	made purchase with this site partsgeek . com , paid 000 . 00 ( so says my bank ).

negative	i tried to book air and hotel to las_vegas .
negative	the dates i wanted were unavailaable , i then changed my date and founf what i wanted , and a quite a savings .... i thought . they charge me for both trips although one wasn_'_t available .
negative	i tried to reach out and correct the error which seems impossible
negative	the booking went out the window and after three_attempts the bag was lifted ..... the company missed the first two times by not calling my daughter on her mobile and the third time the dispatch person_who arrived late had to be begged to wait for 00_minutes ..... all of this is on record and the person dealing_with the bag uplift was very apologetic .... this was the only bright note .

negative	department that there is an issue with my credit_card .
negative	i tried to resolve the issue with mcm credit department , but process was really rocky , the rep was not helpful at all , brushing me off not willing to look into it .
negative	after transfer to sales .... it occurred that at mcm sales_dept .
negative	mixed up my billing
negative	address , although it was entered correctly during online order .
negative	would not accept return
negative	customer service is important and listening to the needs of your customers equally so .
negative	my experience with kyle at vapor nation was a real disappointment on many levels .
negative	i paid for priority_mail .
negative	when i called to inquire_about when my package would be shipped , i was lectured by kyle as to their 0 - 0 day processing time and told that because my order was not a big order , it was not a priority .
negative	this order was for a client and it took a week to arrive .
negative	i gave this company a poor rating on their website and was greeted with a follow_up email from kyle , who offered me vapor bucks towards my next purchase .
negative	i also wrote on their website that i will never ever do_business with them again .
negative	i want a refund for my shipping cost for which i was swinddled out of .
negative	terrible service !
negative	i specified the tail_light was for a 0000_ford taurs and they sent the wrong part .
negative	i bought same part of ebay it was from the same company ( eagle eyes ") as the part i purchased from partsgeek .
negative	the ebay part had a different part number and fit perfect .
negative	i email_requesting to be reimbursed shipping expenses they never replied to my email .
negative	the return process sucks more than any other i know !!!!!!!!!!!
negative	the website will loose many more customers if the web_site for returns isnt fixed . believe that !!!!!!!!!!

negative	i requested they send a postage tag for the wrong part and send me out the correct one but this has_been met with only a rma requiring me to pay to ship back the wrong part and crickets about the replacement .
negative	i '_ve searched google for contact numbers because they don_'_t exist on their site but when i called the 0 i found 0 was disconnected one goes to a voice_mail which isn_'_t returned .

negative	i had previously ordered 0 shower towers ( 0 years_ago and 0 months_ago ) from h / r with no issue .
negative	we are renovating a condominum we recently bought in florida and ordered 0 units to be shipped to the contractor onsite in florida .
negative	the package arrived and h / r shipped the wrong unit , so they screwed_up half of the order .
negative	we had scheduled a plumber to hook both of these up so that had to be rescheduled and we were charged a rescheduling charge .
negative	when i went to customer service online , they wanted a complete description of what they had shipped .
negative	luckily the contractor had taken a picture of the 0 units and then h / r agreed to ship out a replacement .
negative	i had now spent almost 0 hours online .
negative	when the replacement order arrived via_email , i noticed that they were shipping the replacement to our address in new_jersey and i immediately contacted " sadie " back at customer service who assured me , twice , that this is the way it had to be entered , but they were absolutely shipping the replacement to florida .
negative	0 days_later , the replacement arrived at our new_jersey address .
negative	sadie again promised to get back with a forwarding label and information about shipping .
negative	it has now been 0 days and i have heard_nothing from h / r .
negative	on my own and at my expense , i have shipped the replacement to our contractor in florida ( having opened the package to make_sure a : it was the right unit , and b : all the parts were there .
negative	i '_ve now sent another email_requesting a refund of my shipping_charges and some offset for the massive screw - ups .
negative	bottom_line , if you have all the time in the world and don_'_t mind sending things back , several_times , then order from hudson_reed , otherwise beware .
negative	i '_ve recommended them to several folks , but now must go back and warn them .
negative	for this renovation , we have ordered a lot of items online -- another company omitted part of their order but when i contacted them , i got a courteous reply after an_apology and the missing faucet was sent overnight , again with their apology .
negative	january 00 .
negative	h / r sent yet another shower tower to the address in florida , with no prior notice to me .
negative	i continue to get apologies and insistence that they are doing everything in their power and referring the matter to their managers .
negative	meanwhile , i now have 0 shower towers , the original wrong one and one extra one .
negative	i was promised that someone would contact me about pick_up instructions prior to today ... guess what , no email or phone_calls .
negative	it seems my only option is to have the contractor put the stuff on the curb and be done with it .
negative	i cannot_believe the supreme incompetence .
negative	i had written a scathing review of hostel pirwa colonial in cusco using the hostel_world website .
negative	the comment was placed up on the website for a short time before it was taken down .
negative	my comments covered the fact that only my laptop computer had gone missing from a locked locker outside reception , while a large_amount of cash was left behind .
negative	the lock for the locker was sold to us by the hostel .
negative	the police informed me that hostels were known to hire thieves .
negative	nothing has_been done about my complaints in the time since i was told ( 0 . 0 months_ago ) that everyone had to wait_until the police conducted their investigation .
negative	other factors were :
negative	a ) it was later found that keys from the lock sold to me , could open other locks sold by the hostel .
negative	management at the hostel appeared to be apologetic , but did nothing about the issue
negative	b ) out room was ransacked before our theft ( the day before we left to go on the inca trail - nothing was known to be taken ).
negative	house cleaning were very apologetic for leaving the room wide open , but nothing was done about it
negative	c ) upon the police arriving , another traveller identified that his phone had been stolen
negative	d ) meeting other_travellers since that time , one said that it appeared that staff were letting in thieves into the complex and that people would have to fight off the thieves from entering their unlocked rooms and stealing stuff ( actually trying it while they were sitting there in the room - supposedly this happened on several_occassions )
negative	the fact that hostel_world removed my comments that are not consistent with the general more positive nature that hostel_world trys to promote for the hostels it covers appears to be biased in favour of the hostel rather_than the traveller .
negative	being completely informed as a traveller is vital in making a decision about a hostel .
negative	i know as a traveller , i would want to know whether a hostel has a crime problem ( particularly when by all accounts the hostel has a strong security appeal )
negative	i ordered some aftershave on the 0th august and have not received it yet , i have made contact with supplier and they have told me it should arrive soon , if i have not received the product by 00st august contact again , i would have thought it was up to the supplier to make_sure all orders were fulfilled and not the customer to keep chasing .
negative	my pays were not delivered to the address i entered as my delivery address when i ordered .
negative	i still do not have my parts .
negative	i tried to call but was on hold for an_hour before i hung_up .
negative	i filed out a complaint ticket online but have had no reply .
negative	meanwhile my vehicle is still disabled .
negative	.... should have used my local parts store .
negative	where are my parts ?
negative	?
negative	?
negative	will never do_business with these scumbags again
negative	trying to talk to a person buy phone was junk
negative	i purchased a ticket with no_problems , at a great price .
negative	i received an_email_telling_me that my reservation was successful .
negative	0 hours_later i received another email claiming that my reservation had been unsuccessful and sky_tours was unable to confirm my reservation .
negative	i was told that my card had not been charged .
negative	to insure the issue was not with my card i tried again with another card as i had been recommended to by sky_tours .
negative	same thing happened , when in fact both_times i tried to purchase tickets , my card was charged for $_000 each time .
negative	the problem as customer_support pointed_out after i contacted them via_email was " due to the airline being unable to confirm the flight you selected ."
negative	yet both_times , my card was charged , even_though i was told it had not been .
negative	the same flight that i tried to book is still up for someone_else to tie $_000 in and waste their time and money on .
negative	i guess i could try again for kicks and giggles , but i know how it ends .
negative	with no flight , money out of my account and two emails ; one saying my card has not been charged , try again and another saying " there was a problem and the pending charge on your account has_been released and posting time may_vary depending_on the bank and how long it takes for them to update my account ."
negative	this claim that you do not charge an account until a ticket has_been purchased is false .
negative	its black and white , my account had x dollars in it before now it has x minus the amount you charged_twice for the tickets i do not have .
negative	i can not use the money , i can not get that amount out if i wanted .
negative	its not there .
negative	be warned , your gambling with no return when you book with sky_tours .
negative	i am now waiting for the almost $_000 to be put back in my account so i can purchase a flight elsewhere .
negative	c des imitation je me suis fait avorté ôté ne_pas acheter
negative	cost me $_00 to ship there screw up back and they dont pay for returned shipping no matter what and theres nobody u can talk to just a computer ill never buy anything from them again
negative	i placed and ordered and received the wrong item .
negative	i sent a message to the rma department .
negative	i received an_automated email with a ticket number but never received a response from customer service .
negative	i had to call and wait on hold 00_minutes before i was told to take a picture of the item and sent it to them .
negative	the oxygen_sensors for my vehicle had the wires way too short to use .
negative	they were listed to fit my 0000 srx for the downstream side of the cat .
negative	trick me once shame on you .
negative	trick me twice shame on me .
negative	i '_ve learned my lesson not to do_business with these_guys .
negative	s , ammers never got the goods
negative	absolutely insane !
negative	i purchased brake_rotors and they were the wrong ones !
negative	so parts_geek told me i was responsible for return shipping !
negative	wow !
negative	$_00 . 00 .
negative	to ship .
negative	thats more than .
negative	half the cost of the parts .
negative	i am very disgusted .
negative	i will nevet use parts_geek again .
negative	unbelievable !
negative	!!"""""
negative	first let '_s start with they want your money and do not care about what part they are selling !
negative	ordered many_times from supplement_warehouse with no isues , but lately my orders don_'_t ship out till one week_later .
negative	call them up to see where my order is and all they say is we are waiting on this item or that item .
negative	if they dont have stuff in stock just let people know before they order like other web sites !!
negative	!
negative	part was broken
negative	you communication is terrible i spent 00_mins on hold not all of us over 00 want to go to a web_site we need to talk to a real_person . i also do not under stand why i do not get a detailed invoice .
negative	my last order came minus a brake cylinder it arrived 0 days_later no_explanation or notification also came usps but is lised as fedex on the hipping order because i had no information from you and could not contact anyone i ordered with another scource and now am stuck with 0 master cylinders
negative	spirit_airlines , never again , but that '_s their review .
negative	but because of their canceled flight , i was on hold with travelocity for almost an half_hour before finally getting a person .
negative	then 00_minutes later , i was assured all was peachy with my all - inclusive in mexico , only to arrive the next_day with my room given away for ' no - showing '.
negative	the hotel bent_over backwards to correct the problem but was still down the street for one night since they were at capacity .
negative	000 pesos in phone charges and another 00_minutes on hold with travelocity , i was still left paying out of pocket with the hotel and not even an_apology from travelocity for promising to have a warm bed but failing to actually make it happen .
negative	live and learn .
negative	they advertised an item that was no_longer in stock and that they could not deliver .
negative	i short i wasted my time looking at there website , ordering and sending payment information only to find out they could not deliver .
negative	so i guess it wasn_'_t such a great price they offered on an non_existant item .
negative	the part was completely inadequate !
negative	this was our first experience online via my cell_phone , not their app .
negative	when we arrived at the motel we found we could have paid $_00 less .
negative	but no refund from priceline .
negative	this our first and last use of priceline .
negative	maybe we first_timer people are why they make money !
negative	as i was finishing up a project i wound_up needing a few parts .
negative	after searching for someone_who had them in stock , i found that partsgeek showed they had several on hand of both items .
negative	however , after i placed my order i received an_email_stating one of the items was on back order and i would recieve a full_refund , but did not state which item .
negative	after multiple_attempts to talk to a real_person , i realized the only way i could find out which item was back ordered was to submit a help ticket .
negative	the response time was a little less_than 00_hours , but failed to answer my question as the email stated the back ordered item was " air mass meter intake_manifold gasket_set ".
negative	which happens to be 0 seperate items .
negative	after checking my bank_statement i noticed that i had never been charged , so my whole order had been canceled , not just one item on back order .
negative	after this , i won_'_t use them again .
negative	i was very disappointed at the inaccurate size of a 0x and exchanged it for a 0x .
negative	normally my daughter wears an xl .
negative	the 0x was also too small .
negative	the dress was otherwise beautiful as well as my daughter .
negative	it broke my heart to see her suffer through this inaccuracey of sizing .
negative	during prom night her dress strap tore while she was sitting .
negative	i will not make another purchase from promgirl again because the sizes are not reliable .
negative	i wonder what the true 0x girl does in this situation .
negative	the customer service rep . from promgirl couldn_'_t hook me up with a swatch or added material to take to a seamstress for alteration .
negative	disappointed !
negative	i ordered a pair of sunglasses .
negative	a very kind reply came saying the could only deliver the glasses within 00 days , if i wanted to cancel my order i could .
negative	so i did .
negative	guess what !
negative	!
negative	they took the money from my account anyway and after a month , i still_haven_'_t received repayment .
negative	do not buy from sunglassesitaly . com .
negative	they are a fraud !!!!
negative	!
negative	if i could rate this place with no stars , i would .
negative	order number 00 - 0000000 cust_serv ticket 000000
negative	i ordered a part , waited 00 days to have wrong part arrive .
negative	part i ordered was $_00 ( tail_light ), they sent me $_000 part ( power side_mirror ).
negative	contacted cust service , waited almost week for some sort of answer over 0 emails from them .
negative	the answers or emails were extremely vague with little to no information in them .
negative	i wanted to return the wrong part and get the correct one .
negative	cust_serv refunds me what i paid for orginal part less shipping , $_00 .
negative	nothing said about wrong part to be returned .
negative	cust service lacks in communication skills .
negative	and i wonder about the people picking parts too !
negative	overall , i wouldn_'_t recommed this place to anyone .
negative	they are all idiots !
negative	i have ordered from you in the past and have been satisfied but this time was different .
negative	i placed an order on 00 / 00 after receiving a email from you with good prices it was next_day delivery so because of the holiday i thought i would not get until the 0rd or 0th which was fine i was in no hurry .
negative	the problem was when it didn_'_t come on the 0th i called to find out what was going on and tell you that i would not be there and could not take delivery until firday to find out your costumer service was closed and i would call back .
negative	i called back on monday and explained what was going on and i was told you would contact the shipper and make_sure it was not delivered until firday .
negative	well it was delivered on tuesday and sat out in front of my house in the rain and snow and when i got home the box was completely destroyed and all over my front lawn .
negative	than to top things off i got a email from you telling_me that you had tracked my order and it would be there not later than tuesday on thursday_evening after i told you i didn_'_t want it until friday . if this is the kind of service i can expect from you i will have to buy from someone_else .
negative	slow slow slow
negative	been three_days now part dont fit want to return it cannot get a reply car still sitting no smile on my face at all .
negative	whats up ?
negative	please
negative	i tried to contact parts_geek several_times by phone and va thier web email customer service and never got a response .
negative	i was on hold with them twice for 00_minutes or more waiting to get to talk to a real_person and never did .
negative	cool_stuff .
negative	seemingly easy but unreliable shipping and overpriced options
negative	really unhappy that they seem to offer their pricing_structure based on your browsing or link structure .
negative	the price quoted more than doubled when i came through a link supposedly offering the same service .
negative	once i ' d cleared my browsing data the price dropped again .
negative	it might be legal but i think it '_s a very shady practice to offer variable pricing_structure based on browsing history .
negative	unacceptable .
negative	i can not recommend this service to anybody .
negative	the quality of the products from this company is terrible in fact i would say everything they sell must be seconds . the worst thing is when you contact this company to get it put right they make it as difficult as possible to return the faulty products that in the end you give up which is what i have done . i have scrapped there goods and been to b q and purchased another suite and i know if there are any_problems they will change it with no_hassle .
negative	keep clear of this third rate company because you will have problems
negative	had an issue last_year that involved a product return and refund .
negative	in addition to taking a couple of months and way too many hours of time ( it became a part - time job ), they refunded the money to the wrong party .
negative	to make a very long_story , short , they did everything in their power to make their mistake my problem .
negative	i had the issue escalated to an executive resolution expert who continued to try and make me go away despite their mistake .
negative	it was , without_question , the single worst customer service experience of my life .
negative	i am a professional who deals with a lot of corporations , not some whiny customer .
negative	in the end ...
negative	i am out $ 0000 because dell does not understand the value of their customers .
negative	if you do some research , you '_ll find that my story is not an exception .
negative	there are many people who have been wronged by dell .
negative	late arrival on friday when i woke_up saturday_morning i called the front_desk to see if i can upgrade my room .. as the lovely young_lady and the other side of the phone gladly told me that all the bed in this hotel is of the same quality ...
negative	i '_m thinking the flintstones bed hard rock ..
negative	so she could not accommodate me .. did not think much about it just decided to have a good day with my family .
negative	after 00_hours of the amusement park we come to the hotel exhausted .
negative	my youngest daughter decides to go to the restroom no toilet_paper .. my oldest daughter went to take a shower no clean towels .
negative	after a 00 minute wait for fresh towels and toilet_paper .
negative	we freshened up and went out to dinner .
negative	getting back to the hotel after a long day to my surprise my wife and i were getting ready for bed as we were pulling back the bed spread .
negative	this sheets were dirty they didn_'_t even bother changing . fresh sheets for the day ...
negative	it made sense to me they didn_'_t do the room properly .
negative	hey i could maybe sleep on a rock hard bed for one or two_days ..
negative	but when i '_m paying good money for a hotel in a good location i expect a lot more .
negative	especially from the wyndham ... my wife and i and the girls were disappointed in the quality of the hotel upkeep ...
negative	i purchase yearly pass to all four parks and universal ...
negative	i don_'_t think will be staying at the windham anymore ...
negative	when i called the front_desk and i spoke to a manager the next_day he refunded my $_00 deposit but couldn_'_t do any thing else because i had paid book it . com and told me to call bookit . com complaint as well .. bookingid #_00000000 .
negative	please this message goes out to book it . com i would like to hear from you ( 000 ) 000 - 0000 jose fong one very disappointed customer ...
negative	i ordered chocolates and flowers for my mum '_s birthday .
negative	the order was placed well in advance .
negative	however , the order was not delivered .
negative	this is the second year and the same result from gujaratgifts . com .
negative	i strongly_advise all customer to seek alternative company who is more reliable .
negative	i believe they have taken_advantage of me and not processed my refund as_promised .
negative	do not ever use this company for any of your parts needs .
negative	they do not care about you as a customer you mean nothing to them .
negative	they don_'_t even have a phone_number to be able to contact them when there is a problem just support tickets that take them 0 days to respond to .
negative	worst internet auto_parts supplier ever .
negative	better off spending a little more on your parts somewhere_else then to get treated poorly by these fly by night yankees .
negative	i paid over the odds for a small piece of plastic .
negative	this was made worse by paying £_00 for postage when i would have got the same service for £ 0 . 00 .
negative	not happy
negative	i flagged a yellow cab in seattle and a lyft car operated by daniel sibbett stopped and told me to ride with him and i could pay with cash .
negative	he reeked of pot and i asked_him to stop as i felt uncomfortable riding with a driver that was obviously stoned .
negative	he told me he was used to smoking and it was " cool " to drive slow on seattle city streets .
negative	lyft sucks and their drivers are no better_than the nigerian gypsy cabs that roam around seattle .
negative	i investigated this driver and found out he was a failed taxi owners from tacoma .
negative	" don_'_t ride with lyft and their stoned drivers ".
negative	i ordered parts parts_geek said would fit my truck , they did not .
negative	parts_geek made me pay for return shippig of the parts even_though it is clearly their mistake .
negative	never order from them , i sure won_'_t
negative	ordered for 0 different addresse in 0 different areas of the country .
negative	first on to a business client in iowa arrived without a vase or the card to thank them for their business avas rep implied the customer was lying , then refunded a potion .
negative	0nd one to denver arrived again no vase and frozen .
negative	customer service said it stayed outside for too_long and was my fault , it was 00_degrees today .
negative	when i pointed_out the delivery confirmation was less_than 00 min earlier he offered to resend next week ( ordered for valentines_day ).
negative	the alternative was an offer to refund half my price .
negative	what a deal , i would get half the refund on a vase i did not get with the dead flowers that smelled_like decayed lettuce .
negative	0rd order was to iowa .
negative	despite confirmation of delivery at 0 :_00pm , orders to not leave with neighbors and calling the recipient to look for them as soon as i recieved the delivery text .
negative	customer service insisted they were delivered properly .
negative	they again offered to resend them after telling_me , i was mistaken .
negative	apparently the satisfaction guarentee is based on their satisfaction and not the customers .
negative	do not use this service they do not stand_behind the product .
negative	as i read other reviews it appears the bad ones get removed due to lack of proof that purchases were made .
negative	my order numbers are ; 000000 missing vase , no note , 000000 missing vase , dead flowers and 000000 never recieved .
negative	my order was missing parts .
negative	i will not be ordering form you again .
negative	poor quality ........ pool_cover was worn out hence bits of fabric i pool ,
negative	wardrobe damp so could not use ,
negative	only 0 seats in lounge there were 0 of us ,
negative	shower gave off no water slow output ,
negative	villa needed decorating
negative	toilet over flowed
negative	at night the outside was busy with dodgy people meeting up the same people police did attend , all in all not happy have contacted villa_plus heard_nothing ..

negative	we arrived at 0 pm at our hotel in miami to find that our reservation had been canceled by expedia that afternoon without_any notice to us .
negative	the reason was that the credit_card used to guarantee the stay had been canceled a couple of weeks before due to fraudulent use .
negative	i suppose i can understand this cancellation , but to do it without notice or giving us a chance to provide a valid card in its place was infuriating .
negative	the hotel was fully booked by then , as were most others nearby .
negative	we eventually did get a room - but at the rack rate which was well over $_000 for the night - almost twice the price for the expedia - booked room .
negative	the whole_experience was scary , inconvenient and expensive .
negative	there are many alternatives for expedia these days ; hopefully the alternatives will show better customer service and concern .
negative	we purchased the part showing the volume know , tuner knob , and the 0 small e . q knobs , but what you get in the mail is just tuner , volume and 0 small e . q knob , i have read others saying the same thing , do not do_business with these_guys , they pull a bait and switch with there parts , and then will not refund your money , stay_away
negative	recieved part broken and did not except part from ups and called parts_geek and they told me sorry but you have to buy anthouter one and we will refund the purchace in 0 to 0_weeks terrible
negative	try to avoid contact with custumer service , they are useless and really expensive .
negative	the response via_email is substandard and the service over the phone does not exist at all .
negative	called the customer service two times , the first operator hang_up on me .
negative	therefore i had to call ( and pay ) again and another operator was very rude and didn_'_t offer me any more information to help my with my problem .
negative	your policy isn_'_t fair .
negative	you ' re quickly to take my money , but not give me the option to cancel .
negative	your excuse to say you '_ve shipped the item with in the hour is a way of collecting 00_% restocking_fee .
negative	feel for the ones that mis clicked large items like a engine or transmisson .
negative	your purchase agreement is in black and white , but you clearly don_'_t remind people of it before purchase .
negative	had to find out in a email , and furthermore you didn_'_t even give me a tracking_number , so i can refuse the package .
negative	had to pay to ship it back , just so you can take additional 00_% from a misclick purchase .
negative	i was billed multiple_times , had to call several_times to iron out the issue and had to deal with accent i can '_t understand .
negative	i was not refunded the full_amount i was supposed to .
negative	i just fave up and didn_'_t want to deal with rude and unhelpful customer service anymore and decided to not go after the small_amount travelocity still owe me .
negative	i ordered far_cry 0 insane_edition and it never turned_up !
negative	£_00 down the drain and i have to wait 00 days to claim a lost parcel .
negative	never using shipton again .
negative	nearly 0_weeks since payment made .
negative	the camera has_been held in uk customs , presumably due to incorrect paperwork by digitalrev .
negative	refund refused by digitalrev until they have received the returned item which may well never happen as customs show no sign of releasing the parcel .
negative	now digitalrev are not even responding to my emails !
negative	i bought jacks magic step stuff to clean stains on my pool steps .
negative	i followed the instructions and had the chemical levels in the pool set to match the instructions i applied the product and nothing happened .
negative	i emailed customer service and asked for advice or a refund .
negative	i received neither /.
negative	basically i . was told no refunds on chemicals
negative	dont buy from this company as they do not stand_behind what they sell
negative	i ordered parts , never recieved .
negative	they did not process order corectly .
negative	attempted to resolve with customer service .
negative	zero response .
negative	i ordered from a different company and now have my parts .

negative	i booked a car for 0 days , knowing that may be i will return it few hours_later .
negative	the difference_between 0 and 0 days was 00 $ in total .
negative	after booking i called service to verify that in case i will return it later ( more than 0 days ), i will pay approximately additional 00 $, which i accepted . when i reached miami office , first they told me that if i return it late , i will have to pay 000 $ and when i asked to get in touch with service i was told to go , make a phone_call and close it with them .
negative	i asked the help of the front_desk at the counter and was told that i should manage myself .
negative	also , although the car booked for me was a " ford estate " ( we were 0 people only ), they tried to sell me a suv , saying , that by this i will promiss myself a big car ( i booked compact car ).
negative	i fealt very bad , like they wer trying to cheat me .
negative	i will nevere again rent a car from [_link ] and not going to use vipcars for renting a car .
negative	don_'_t work with them !!

negative	we rented a car via auto_europe to be waiting for us at barcelona_airport at the dollar rental_desk march 00 0000 .
negative	on arrival , we found out that no such rental_desk exists for this company .
negative	i asked at all other rental desks , police and airport info
negative	showing my voucher only to be told no such rental company exists at barcelona_airport .
negative	i called the local number on voucher got a recorded_message in spanish .
negative	in the end i was forced to rent a car from another company at significant expense because i did not pre order .
negative	on arrival to our destination 0 hours away i emailed autoeurope demanding an explanation and an immediately refund .
negative	i was told i could go back to the airport and pick_up the car ( dude , it doesn_'_t exist !!)
negative	or wait_until the rental period was over for a refund ( cause it takes that long to figure_out that i never picked_up the car in the first place !!)
negative	fast forward to end of april still , no refund , they " need to hear back from rental_desk at the barcelona_airport to make_sure i never got the car " and guess what - no one is answering their phone_calls ( duh !)
negative	after multiple complaints they finally refunded my money beginning of may .
negative	to date no_explanation as to why they rented me a car from an imaginary rental company at that location
negative	no apology for their ineptitude , and my stress and extra expense
negative	be aware this is not a reputable_company !
negative	!
negative	david
negative	in response to your repsonse :
negative	nice try !
negative	this is very telling when a company cannot admit that they screwed_up !
negative	i went over the voucher again .
negative	below is cut and paste verbatum from voucher !

negative	as stated i also went with voucher to all rental_car desks .
negative	at barcelona_airport_terminal 0 they all denied knowledge .
negative	shame on you .
negative	first of all they ask to much fees .
negative	0 % of your sales + an_additional 0 % if you are not in usa and need to convert money .
negative	after that , if you are a honest person than you won_'_t like paypal .
negative	as a seller if someone claim a paypal_dispute for a unreceived item you will lose even if you have a tracking_number that shown that the item was delivered .
negative	as a buyer , you will win easily if your claim is about unreceived item but if it '_s for something else like fake item , damaged item , etc than you will lose .
negative	all those situations happened to me and no mater how bad you want to fight against scammer you will lose .
negative	your only chance to win is if you received nothing .
negative	i can understand some people like paypal cause if none of the situation i mentioned never happened to them then there '_s no problem .
negative	but as soon as you ' ill received a damage or fake item or as a seller if a bad buyer start a claim even after received his item than you will hate them .
negative	i purchased 0 ink_cartridges .. black , blue , red , and yellow .

negative	i replaced them with hp 000xl and after a couple of test sheets everything was working_properly again .
negative	i had to pick one star just to post this review otherwise i would have selected no stars ...
negative	feel free to phone me for an explanation .
negative	chuck braun 000 - 000 - 0000
negative	bought a shelf for bathroom .
negative	it did not fit .
negative	i called and asked them to return it .
negative	twice they said wait for them to send me a return_label .
negative	they never did .
negative	will never deal with them again ...
negative	the items i ordered werent available from the supplier which isnt their fault .
negative	however i canceled my order and they said my money would be refunded in 0 - 00 business days .
negative	its way past that mark and my credit_card has not been refunded .
negative	i have emailed them several_times and gotten no further response .
negative	now i '_m having to go through my bank to get the charge refuted and its taking much longer .
negative	terrible customer service !
negative	i ordered a car part and received an_email_stating that the part was not available and that they were cancelling my order .
negative	i ordered from another part company and that part arrived two_days_later .
negative	parts_geek sent the same part and charged my account for it even_though they said it was unavailable .
negative	it arrived two_days after the other company '_s part .
negative	makes you wonder_how they stay in business .
negative	anybody need a back door_handle for a 0000_kia sedona ??
negative	?
negative	ii '_ll never use these_people again , you should ' nt either .
negative	tried to call with a question about which front strut to use for a 0000_volvo v00 .
negative	i knew that the strut_mount system had changed in early 0000 but couldn_'_t fathom , since the springs were the same , that the struts would have a different base_plate .
negative	left me with not only having to pay the return freight but also being charged a restocking_fee .
negative	this could have been easily avoided if one my multiple_attempts to call had been successful .
negative	why list a number to call if someone , after waiting for quite some time , gets a message to send an online customer service request that will be responded to within 00_hours .
negative	none of my customers , who also get discounted prices , ever have to go through that type of experience .
negative	all that said i will say the price and delivery time was very good .
negative	order confirmation and tracking_information came through quickly .
negative	basically i probably would be reluctant to regularly shop with parts_geek .
negative	might look them up to get a price comparison but i like access to a live experienced person when needed .
negative	they did not send out one of my parts and then would not answer any of my e_-_mails or phone_call .
negative	still no part !!!!!!!!!
negative	!
negative	this was the first and last time i will ever use parts_geek
negative	i ordered a radiator for my 0000_toyota_camry on nov . 0 or 00th .
negative	i have not seen the box yet .
negative	there are five ( 0 ) of us who live in our house and none of the four told me about a large delivery with my name on it .
negative	needed new headlight_assembly for my 0000_dodge .
negative	the prices are pretty_much the same from the online companies .
negative	i selected parts_geek .
negative	my order came in a reasonable_amount of time but i ordered the wrong headlight_assembly .
negative	i called the listed number for customer service 0 or 0 times but there was no one there and the phone_call is kicked to a message center .
negative	message center requested my number for a call - back ... no call_backs after numerous requests .
negative	on their website you can leave an_email message requesting a " problem ticket number .".
negative	did that 0 times with no response .
negative	finally connected via phone after waiting maybe 00_minutes on the phone ... ordered a new headlight_assembly .... was told by lee that the " problem ticket number " would go out that day ... that was 0_weeks_ago with no contact since .
negative	it '_s not worth it .
negative	word spreads and they are shooting themselves in the forehead with terrible service .
negative	only alternative now is to charge back on the credit_card .
negative	i '_m not going to pay the orig bill to a company that simply refuses to take back the " guaranteed return " merchandise ....
negative	i can '_t understand a website that shows " in stock " levels that are meaningless ..
negative	the website will take your money even if the item is not in stock and then apoligize by stating they don_'_t have it .
negative	it took 0 days to get an_email_stating they did not have it in stock and would refund my money in 0 - 0 business days .
negative	wow - thanks .
negative	i was without my car for 0 days you held my money captive and then had to go searching once my money was returned .
negative	there are other options out there for product reviews .
negative	too expensive for small businesses .
negative	ironic to be writing a negative_review about a negative - centric company , but cnn takes the cake .
negative	their stories are such debbie downers always !
negative	really wish they would find some journalistic integrity and cover balanced stories that are also uplifting at times .
negative	do not , i repeat do not book a flight w this company , they are scandals .
negative	i dealt_with what felt_like unprofessional 00 year_old as my customer service reps and am very dissatisfied in every_aspect with this company .
negative	i will never be doing_business with them again , and suggest you pay the extra $_00 to take your business elsewhere .
negative	shower_valve duly_arrived but i was surprised that it came without flex / rose head or rising rail / wall_bracket .
negative	upon revisiting the sales advert i found in the very small_print that these items are to be ordered separately and at an extra_charge .
negative	i think this snaps at sharp practice -- would you buy a car and then find the wheels are extra ?
negative	no you would not !
negative	!
negative	when you add on the parts that are needed to have a fully working shower the total_cost is no cheaper_than going to a normal merchant who sell you a shower that is complete .
negative	shame that they have resorted to this kind of practice because the shower_valve is actually of a good quality .
negative	i feel so annoyed by this practice that i have reported the transaction both to paypal and my local trading_standards .
negative	i paid for a reservation but when i showed_up they sent me away , telling_me the lot was full .
negative	even worse they made it seem the lot they were sending me to would accept my reservation , but when i got there the other lot said they had nothing to do with mape and that those guys did this " all the time " -- i . e .
negative	they overbooked and then sent people away thinking their reservation would be honored when it wouldn_'_t .
negative	to their credit global_airport_parking gave_me a refund the next_day , but i '_m still out the extra money i had to pay the other lot to park without a reservation .
negative	i don_'_t normally complain but in this case i '_m actually going to the better business_bureau ; parking express is completely unscrupulous and they should not be allowed to get away with it .
negative	apparently my back cover had a hair line crack ?
negative	very suspicious !!!!!
negative	seems to me to be a bad way to do_business , this phone was also new and extra bubble_wrapped myself when sent yet they dropped value from 00euro to 00 saying it had a hairline crack from ware and tear !?!
negative	yet couldn_'_t produce a picture of it .???
negative	very dodgy dealings .
negative	i '_m not impressed .
negative	this guy really sucks , to slow and untruthful , pay big bucks for 0 - 0 day shipping , maybe get it in 0 - 0 days , really slow on rma '_s and refunds or credits .
negative	don_'_t waist your time or money !!
negative	!
negative	no update on my order .
negative	only received part of the order with no_explanation or email to let_me know the status of the other part of the order
negative	i ordered the wrong part which was totally my fault .
negative	i emailed the company immediately but it was too_late the order was already shipped .
negative	i still_haven_'_t received my refund .
negative	i will tell_everyone i know to never use partsgeek .
negative	i have never written a bad review before , but felt i would share this with trustpilot .
negative	first of all i ran_into an issue with cjs_cd_keys when purchasing a steam_key .
negative	they tried to push the problem onto steam and ask me to contact them , doing so steam said it was not a valid steam_key and to go back to them .
negative	doing so , they told me they would get back to me and reply , marking the ticket as solved (?).
negative	checking back 0_weeks_later on their website , the game listing was different and now no_longer a steam_key , however i was not updated on this .
negative	i replied to the ticket to be told that i made my order before the problem was detected .
negative	( even_though i wasn_'_t notified about this ).
negative	in trying to get a refund , i was suggested to torrent the game ; which isn_'_t the best plan to go with and not what i had asked for .
negative	eventually i got refunded .
negative	i come_back to cjs_cd_keys , having a little more hope in purchasing a key for a friend , to be found i have to now verify myself , with not only a phone_verification , but having to send personal files such as a bank card or statement or license .
negative	as of writing this , i am being forced to wait longer for the key i purchased , expecting to receive instantly .
negative	i will not be buying keys from here again , and i urge other people to try <_external link_removed_> ( not purposely advertising ) to see alternative solutions to cjs_cd_keys .
negative	there '_s no root ball on any of the trees !
negative	they are very skinny , no hair roots .
negative	not sure they ' re gonna make it !!!
negative	for that kind of money , we ' re very disappointed .

negative	!
negative	i received the wrong part .
negative	i was able to modify the harness to make it work , but for the price it should have fit .
negative	unfortunately the part i ordered i received was broken and unusable .
negative	they allowed_me to return the part but as long as i paid for shipping the 00_lb part .
negative	then the refund would come in 00 business days .
negative	the whole_experience was just completely_unacceptable .
negative	i would never order another part from them again .
negative	quando encontrei a healthdesigns . com minha primeira premissa foi de_suplementos bons e baratos ... porém depois de 0 meses á espera desses suplementos , minha opinião é que o barato saiu caro , pois paguei e nao recebi nada .

negative	was not a good experience .
negative	my order was suppose to contain 0 bushings , what showed_up was 0 .
negative	tried to call but was told i would have to request some form to tell them my issue .
negative	when i was finally able to tell them , they sent an e_-_mail that said that they could not just send me what was missing , i would have to return what they sent and wait for a credit and that if i still wanted the product i would have to reorder the item .
negative	they also stated they would send another e_-_mail explaining how to return the item .
negative	i would get that e_-_mail in 00 - 00_hours .
negative	that was 0 days ago , i am still_waiting .
negative	dpd tried to deliver a parcel to us whilst we were out .
negative	they left a standard ' sorry we missed you ' card but it had no information about what had been done with the parcel on it .
negative	we went online to find out what had happened to the parcel and the online response was that it had been left with ' smith '!
negative	nothing else .
negative	there is no - one called smith that we know of in our road .
negative	i contacted the ' make it right ' team whose response was , curiously , that " the address we have been given is different to the one you have provided me with in your email .
negative	i therefore advise , that you contact the sender to discuss the issue ."
negative	i pointed_out that i don_'_t know who the sender was because i don_'_t know what was in the parcel ( we receive a high_volume of parcels , many of them for a holiday let that we manage ).
negative	their further response was " i am sorry to advise i am unable to locate your details in the system with the tracking reference provided .
negative	if anyone at your address has received any text_messages or emails from us at all , i can search for your details with your email address or mobile number .
negative	alternatively , if you can provide any other tracking_number ( parcel or consignment number ) then we can use this to find your information ."
negative	well , no .
negative	all i can tell you is that your driver has left a note with your reference_number on it stating that a parcel destined for us has_been left with someone somewhere called smith .
negative	what are you going to do about it ?
negative	no response after 00 days .
negative	do not buy from this company thay will take your money and send you wrong part , was not returned mony or sent the wrighr part jhfolger0000 @_yahoo . com
negative	i will never buy off you again , i might even go to marlton to see if you exist .
negative	we ordered a handheld controller for xbox one on dec . 00th as a christmas_gift .
negative	it is now january 0nd and we still_haven_'_t received it .
negative	the order status has_been " in progress " for weeks .
negative	i wrote to the company and was told that it would be shipped this week but the week is almost over and the controller still is " in progress " and has not shipped .
negative	will never do_business with gamermodz again !
negative	very frustrating and disappointing !!
negative	!
negative	paypal will make every excuse possible to hold your funds , freeze them , temp hold them , etc even if it has nothing to do with you !
negative	i waited 0 months for $_000 because of paypal !
negative	$@&$ paypalsucks
negative	your customer service phone_number is the worse , no one ever picks_up on your end .
negative	if you have a question that requires you to speak to someone you can for get it .
negative	your not rude on the phone because you never get to talk to anyone . the price on the parts are very reasonable my only problem with you guys is your customer_services need a lot of work no offense but it sucks !!
negative	!
negative	don_'_t bother
negative	collusion was allowed to take place in my league .
negative	i could see this happening in one of my cheaper leagues , but every owner knew it was collusion yet the trade was allowed .
negative	even a novice would know it was cheating .
negative	i won_'_t be back .
negative	i sent from uruguay to cancun and they took 0 days to deliver !
negative	they don_'_t work on week ends ... disaster !!
negative	! inutiles and don_'_t answer the phone for complaints !
negative	though purchasing insurance was simple and allowed_me to easily comparison prices , because i was not dealing directly with the carriers , much of the fine_print was missing .
negative	my wife and i purchased a plan that we believed included our physicians as in network ( we triple - checked this before making our purchase decision ).
negative	two months later , we were shocked to learn that our doctors are considered " out of network " in the ( very expensive ppo ) plan that we purchased -- and we also have sky - high bills to show for it .
negative	worse , the carrier we selected via ehealth informed us that they do no offer a plan that our physicians accept .
negative	we are left with the pain - in - the - neck choice of finding new doctors in network or canceling this plan and finding a new one to preserve our relationship with our doctors .
negative	ordered the part around the 00th_december , didnt arrive til 0th_jan , what kind of business has delivery times as poor as these , i appreciate it was the christmas_period however other repureable companies sent goods out before_christmas and they were received before the new year .
negative	i have to dat ehad no reply to my email complaining of this poor service and no correspondance has_been received from the shower_doctor to explain_why it would take so long to arrive .
negative	will never be gracing them with my custom again .
negative	we booked a hotel , when we got there our suite turned_out to be a room with two double_beds on our 0 year anniversary !!!
negative	i spent two hours on tge phone with bookit . com and the end resolution was we '_ll look into the account .
negative	for 0 months after i sat on hold 0 different times .
negative	finally recieved a 00 . 00 credit for all that trouble i will never use this site again !!
negative	!
negative	it '_s cheap but not worth the hassle .
negative	took weeks to get one order .
negative	fast free shipping ?
negative	try free shipping but we will get it to you when we can be bothered .
negative	when i complained and asked to cancel my repeat order all i got was " it will be shipping soon and we will send you a tracking_number " - they did not answer my point about canceling the repeat order - and of course i never got the tracking_number , it just turned_up one day at my house .
negative	look don_'_t get staff from here they show you one price and charge other more_expensive you wont get any response from them
negative	how the hell do i use my reward card ????
negative	i entered it but it never applied to the total ?????
negative	don_'_t understand !
negative	!
negative	upon_arrival at the springhill , i tried to confirm the rate .
negative	they said they were unable to do so since i did not go through springhill directly .
negative	i thought that i had booked through them but realized i did not as the website i looked at was similar to the actual springhill website .
negative	the person on the phone gave_me a rate of $_000 for a handicap_room .
negative	not only was i charged $_000 but they did not have a reservation for a handicap_room .
negative	only after i checked my email did i find all this out .
negative	attempted to sell the seller my " politics and government in california " book for the $_00 they had confirmed i was to receive .
negative	instead , the seller decided not to notify me , and i had to waste 0 hours of my life in order to figure_out they had decided to keep my book instead .
negative	after some back and forth phone_calls , they magically " found " my book in their warehouse and forced me to pay $ 0 . 00 for my book they tried to fradulently take from me .
negative	unfortunately since i am a college_student and need the money , i had to pay to get the book back .. or so i thought , in order to sell it to a reputable_company like amazon , like i should have done .
negative	unfortunately , this company has decided to screw me again and not even send me back the book that i requested on august 0th .
negative	if my calendar is working correctly , that was 00 days ago that i have been waiting .
negative	at this point , i want my $ 0 . 00 back since i did not receive even my own book back .
negative	this is an absolutely horrible company , and probably the worst customer service that i have ever received .
negative	wrong part sent
negative	no communication
negative	communication received after multiple requests to send me the correct part and a return shipping_label was short and unprofessional , didn_'_t even sign the response with a name .
negative	tired of of games i performed a charge back with my bank .
negative	i ' d avoid this company and review on line other reviews , i wish i did .
negative	their oprices are great , but if you need to return something they make it impossible .
negative	they wont answer the phone or respond tp emails
negative	i purchased a guild_wars 0 digital instant digital code , that was stated to be shipped instantly .
negative	ended_up arriving 0_weeks_later !
negative	!..
negative	placed and order and didn_'_t know i couldn_'_t place alternative address , tried_calling them and they have the worst phone service , was not able to get a hold of anyone on phone after a 00 min wait the call gets automatically disconnected !
negative	!
negative	did not talk to anyone after call after call did not receive my full order .
negative	i put in the right item a a /_c condenser check it on my order form but receive the wrong part just would like to talk to someone just to return the wrong one to get the right one could never talk to anyone set on the phone for hours i have to send back the wrong one and pay shipping for your mistake that is not fair you reap what you sow i know you don_'_t care about my little_bit of money but if you want to do the right thing you can reach me at 000 - 000 - 0000 after 0pm
negative	where to start ??
negative	it was so bad that if someone wrote a book on how not to run a hotel , they would use this hotel as their primary example .
negative	first when i checked in the lady that was supposed to check me in was also running the register at the convience store that was just off the lobby , so she kept stopping to ring up someone '_s purchase .
negative	if they are that busy they should have had 0 people , one to run the register , the other to check in and check out guests .
negative	then the lady could not find me in the system , and when she finally did find me the data in her system was not correct , so for example she did not know that my stay was for 0 nights , even_though i had paid for 0 nights though the online system .
negative	once i was finally checked in i went to my room , and it was nasty .
negative	part of the ceiling , over the window , was falling in , with peeling paint and exposed insulation .
negative	the remote for the tv , an old crt type and not a modern flat_screen , did not work .
negative	the telephone was not working either so i could not call the front_desk to ask for a new remote .
negative	the bathroom was clean , but the soap was cheap and harsh and there was no shampoo .
negative	the bed was hard , lumpy and uncomfortable , with flat , hard pillows .
negative	when i came back to my room for my second night my room had not been cleaned , or my bed made or my used towels replaced .
negative	since my phone was not working i could not call down to the front_desk to ask , so i simply dealt_with it .
negative	checkout was just as disorganized and fustrating as checkin had been , and for the same reasons .
negative	see_above .
negative	the wheel was not in the condition as_advertised .
negative	i placed an order and a kept checking the status to see if there was a tracking_number .
negative	0 days_later i saw that my bank_account had been charged for the order so i excitedly looked to see if there was a tracking_number ... no luck .
negative	0 more days went by and i kept checking but still the order was just sitting in the warehouse .
negative	eventually a full week had passed and the order had still not shipped .
negative	tried_emailing the company but haven_'_t received a reply back yet .
negative	i wish i had ordered from a different company because this one looked good but i had no_idea that they don_'_t have any employees .
negative	i wonder_if i '_ll ever see the part or if i '_ll ever get a refund .
negative	maybe its a big scam ?
negative	who_knows ?
negative	i ordered a lexmark # 00 color ink_cartridge .
negative	they sent me a black_cartridge for a lexmark p000 printer .
negative	they accepted a return .
negative	then they did not have a # 00 cartridge .
negative	a re - manufactured # 00 was sent but it would not work in the lexmark p - 000 printer .
negative	the printer would lock up with a wrong cartridge error .
negative	all operating parameters were hung_up .
negative	also .
negative	to be fair i , have not had the time to get back to the vendor .
negative	i will contact the vender and see what his organization will do about the errors i have had to deal with .
negative	you do not get a full description and fitting advise and when you get it wrong it turns_out time_consuming and very expensve , will only use again if there is an exceptionsal bargain
negative	they costed me more money $_000 . 00 on part to fill my order right from local store , they never tried to help by making my order right .
negative	i was very disappointed and not sure i will be ordering there again .
negative	part of what i did get was same as the parts house .
negative	i was going to order parts for a dodge pick_up but now have reconcidered do to customer service .
negative	communication .
negative	there is none .
negative	they never reply within the allotted_time .
negative	they take your money right_away , but slow to issue rma '_s to return core .
negative	as of this moment still_waiting for rma .
negative	i tried to cancel within the 00 hour period .
negative	they said they could only issue me a credit .
negative	then the $_000 . 00 credit they issued me could not be used until i paided them $_000 . 00 .
negative	they never told me any of this .
negative	i only delayed my flight because i got in for emergency cancer surgery .
negative	just had the worst experience with expedia .
negative	i have plans to travel to cabo in late july .
negative	booked a reservation at the grand solmar , but before doing so i asked the expedia representative to see if the resort had any construction or renovation going on during the time i would be traveling .
negative	he assured me they don_'_t but the next_day i called the resort to double_check and they said they have construction going on and they don_'_t have a time frame when it would be done .
negative	thank_god i got the travel_insurance and that expedia has a 00 hour cancellation_policy right .... wrong !!!
negative	i waited on hold for 00 - 00_minutes at a time and must have called 0 - 0 times through out the next_day and couldn_'_t get anyone on the line to cancel or even just change hotel .
negative	funny how i could get a live representative to take a new reservation but couldn_'_t get anyone to make a change or cancel a reservation .
negative	so when i could get through , the 00 hour grace_period expired .
negative	they wouldn_'_t honor it .
negative	but i '_m still safe right , i got the full insurance_policy that states for any reason you can change your reservation or even cancel , i might_add its a $_000 additional_charge ... wrong again , because i didn_'_t pay in full ... i opted to take_advantage of their installment plan they wouldn_'_t honor the insurance_policy .
negative	so i then told them i will pay it in full so i can change the hotel .... umm no sir i can not do that .
negative	so all in all , i '_m stuck_paying $ 0 , 000_dollars for a hotel that will be under_construction , wasted over 0 - 0 hours trying to get through to expedia only to be told by customer representative by the name of " uno " employee number 0000000 i '_m out of luck .... by the way we got disconnected and he never bothered to call me back ..... lets_see how long this posts stays up before they rip it down , thanks expedia !!
negative	!
negative	have purchased twice !
negative	first time excellent !
negative	0nd time dreadful !
negative	told my card had not been accepted twice but the card had been accepted !
negative	sent email_telling_me this and also they had tried to call !
negative	took many_times to speak to someone !
negative	then my package turned_up and money taken from my card !
negative	wow , avoid this bunch .
negative	haven_'_t experienced similar return procedure / hassle / delay in a decade .
negative	ever heard of customer service partsgeeks ?
negative	was sent wrong product .
negative	required email to get response as to how to return .
negative	told 00 - 00_hours to get answer back .
negative	then get response that assumes i '_ve made a mistake in my order ( which i hadn_'_t - their website shows incorrect product for the desired application ).
negative	wanted more information ( presumably to prove to me how i ' d screwed_up ).
negative	didn_'_t like tone of response whatsoever .
negative	then told another 00 - 00_hours for a reply for rma .
negative	to their credit , rma came within hours ( but this is 0 days after asking for refund / return ).
negative	then , once get rma are told may take up to 00 business days to issue refund ?
negative	for their mistake ??
negative	really ??
negative	?
negative	horrific / shady ( and probably illegal ) business_practices requiring lots of hoops to jump thru , clearly designed to keep your money as long as possible .
negative	if you confirm an order , then it should be shipped .
negative	don_'_t confirm an order until the product availability is verified .
negative	fis o_pedido dia 00 / 00 e_ainda nao chegou nada aqui pra min ja tem 0 meses .
negative	sendo que o frete foi o international airmail 0 / 0_weeks
negative	então alguem sabe qual medida legal posso tomar contra a hd ^?
negative	me manda um e_-_mail brunodeeleon @_hotmail . com
negative	this site is not a fair or accurate representation of a business .
negative	period .
negative	unless you pay them the only people who post reviews are people who wish to leave negative_reviews .
negative	i ' n my situation i did not even know people had left poor reviews .. when i found out i logged in and atleast responded to the bogus reviews ..( zero verification needed just an_email address was needed to leave a review at this time ) i then began sending customers to this site proactively only to hear back from my customers that the site would not let them leave a positive review .
negative	when i inquired i was told my " trial_period " had expired .
negative	what trial_period ?
negative	then later on i received another poor review .. hmm strange ..
negative	i thought the trial_period had expired ?
negative	it seems that they will let in negative_reviews to try and get you to pay for their service so you can bring your rating back up .. that is not a fair and accurate representation and its bordering on criminal .
negative	another example of how this site is not accurate would be lets say you sell 00 , 000 items in a year and 0 people leave negative_reviews .. that would be way less_than half a percent of the customers yet would be a terrible rating on trustpilot because you have to pay in order to get new positive_reviews ...
negative	i would suggest very strongly that trust_pilot level the playing field or they are going to end up with a class action law suit .
negative	perhaps there already is ?
negative	!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
negative	!
negative	i ordered 0 chairs last sunday costing_£_000 . 00 but they only confirmed the delivery date on the confirmation of payment page .
negative	it came as the 00th_feb 0000 !
negative	i needed the chairs a lot sooner so i cancelled the order by email immediately and ordered another set through someone_else .
negative	i have had no response as to getting my money back and no confirmation from anyone that my money will be returned .
negative	i have sent 0 emails .
negative	i cannot get a phone back for more than 0_weeks .
negative	i am getting more and more convinced this is a scam .
negative	infurn , if you are reading this give me my money back now !!
negative	i will chase the money you owe through any legal means and make life very hard for you !
negative	in return to the below reply i got an_automated reply saying i would get a response in 00_hours .
negative	i got a response 0 days_later and only after i posted the above review .
negative	i kept on interrupting because repeating them same point about the incompetent way you operate has nothing to do with me .
negative	i do not care whether your system says 00 weeks dispatch and you dispatched it conveniently today even_though i have sent 0 emails cancelling it , the first 00_mins after i had bought them 0 days ago !
negative	it does not concern me that your system is faulty .
negative	all i want is my money back as i am legally entitled .
negative	i do not see how you cannot stop the dispatch .
negative	that is ridiculous that you are not in contact with the delivery drivers and frankly it is all too convenient .
negative	i think the contempt you show in your response says it all .
negative	i expect the money to be in my account by 00 days or i will take legal_action .
negative	i will obviously reject the chairs if they are delivered .
negative	i really do not understand_why you replied like that because it just made the situation worse .
negative	i look_forward to the updates of when my money will arrive in my account .
negative	yelp approach you and use some data to attract u to do ad however if you dont do it , they will filter all good reviews .
negative	fake paid reviewers just gonna destroy your business .
negative	ordered on 0 / 00 / 00 .
negative	checked the order tracker periodically .
negative	it was on it '_s way .
negative	it '_s still on it '_s way .
negative	still coming .
negative	i called .
negative	on hold 00_minutes .
negative	hung_up .
negative	emailed for status on 0 / 00 .
negative	my credit_card was charged on 0 / 00 .
negative	it was never shipped .
negative	requested a refund .
negative	received the refund notice less shipping .
negative	emailed again for shipping too .
negative	refund notice for shipping too .
negative	never again !
negative	i did not receive my package i purchased from redbubble .
negative	i contacted customer service and have had no response to where my package is or why it was not delivered .
negative	i got recommended this site from a cousin , used it and started on a terrible foot .
negative	would not waste my time here again , customer service is a fail for not at_least responding and trying to communicate with me what happened .
negative	i was very disappointed with the product i purchased , the lance used to obtain a blood sample did not work so i was unable to carry out the test with this product , so i '_m not happy with my purchase from home_health .
negative	management of this business needs complete review .
negative	stay clear of this unprofessional outfit .
negative	i received keys for runescape membership cards and they were already used , they would not issue a refund
negative	i rented a car in costa_rica through vip_cars .
negative	first i found a very good offer , and i talked to one of the vip agents , and they confirmed the rental to me on the phone .
negative	when i had not received a confirmation in 0 days , i called them , and was told that " while they were booking the car , it had been reserved for someone_else ".
negative	funny enough , the same car at the lower price was still listed on the vip site .
negative	vip then offered me the same car at a higher price .
negative	since i needed a car , i agreed .
negative	this time i got a confirmation , but when i arrived in costa_rica , they " just ran_out of the car " and could only offer me another car ( smaller and not 0wd at an even higher price .
negative	don_'_t rent from this outfit .
negative	it is the worst rip_off i have seen .
negative	on a scale of 0 - 00 partsgeek gets a - 0 .... unbelievable !!!
negative	!
negative	we are happy with the sunglasses we bought but not happy with the customer service .
negative	we live in a rural delivery area and our delivery address needs to be formatted correctly in order for us to get delivery .
negative	the smartglasses system converted the delivery address incorrectly -- not the way i entered it .
negative	as son as i noticed it ( i think the same day ), i emailed their customer service asking for it to be corrected .
negative	two_days_later i got an_email_asking me to contact the local courier and correct the address with them .
negative	i dont understand_why smartglasses didnt look after it .
negative	anyway i rang the local courier and they did make the change somewhat -- but not enough as the glasses were delivered to another similar address .
negative	the kind people at that other address phoned me and i drove over to their place and picked them up ... and gave them a nice bottle of wine fro being so good as to track me down ( when they could have just kept them ).
negative	i need to buy some reading_glasses but probably wont as i cant_afford to have them go missing in the mail .
negative	the good things i can say are that the glasses are good , they were a fair price and they were shipped quickly .
negative	i have never dealt_with a more horrible company in my life .
negative	first they ship me the wrong college sweatshirt for my sons graduation .
negative	then they promise to have my right one here within 0 days .
negative	now i have to get on a plane and go to his graduation without a gift for him .
negative	then they tell me and my eight month pregnant wife ( who is very upset ) that they can not put a suoervisor on the phone .
negative	yet they told her that the supervisors were currently asissting other customers .
negative	so after sitting on hold they come_back and say we can put in a request for a supervisr to call back within 00_hours and that the proper channels must be followed .
negative	ok , but what about the proper channels for a business transaction ?
negative	they have our money but we don_'_t have what we ordered .
negative	so now we are being forced to get on a plane and go to our son '_s graduation with no gift .
negative	they have no_clue what good customer service is and i am very upset with the fact that my wife is so upset .
negative	never ever use this company !!!
negative	!
negative	tredz have several_times been unable to fulfil an order for items they offer at the lowest_price on search_engines and offer me a lower standard item at an uncompetitive price .
negative	this has happened in the last six_months and appears to be deliberate attempt to pull in a customer , take money and then offer something which the customer never wanted .
negative	note_: ate this point , they already have your money !!
negative	!
negative	give it a miss and support your local independant retailer !
negative	ich warte bis heute auf_die_lieferung der visitenkarten .

negative	before ordering the part ( radiator ) for my car cadillac deville 0000 i did provided the vehicle vin_number and other details asked by the representative during the live_chat .
negative	the part chosen and recommended by your rep was ordered .
negative	the part received does not fit and needs some extra modifications and replacement of all pipes .
negative	the delay , waste of time and not using the vehicle .
negative	your rep are not experienced and try to throw and sell wrong parts .
negative	this will be effecting your reputation in the market .
negative	more than a week i emailed your customer service and never_heard_anything .
negative	i bought a door_handle for my 0000_ford e000 .
negative	received the wrong handle which you said would work .
negative	it wouldn_'_t , it was a totally different style .
negative	over a week_later i finally receive an_rma_# and find out i am responsible for return shipping .
negative	i am very unsatisfied and will never do_business with your company again .
negative	the support ist very bad and takes very long .
negative	software not works all times
negative	my parts were shipped from partsgeek . com in a timely_manner .
negative	however , the online receipt i received from them listed my tracking_number as a ups number and the tracking feature didn_'_t work .
negative	after_contacting customer service , it was determined that the package was actually shipped via_fedex .
negative	the fedex tracking_system stated that a delivery attempt had been attempted twice already , though no door tag was ever left on my door .
negative	i contacted fedex who had no_explanation .
negative	they suggested i leave a note for the delivery person on my door , which i did .
negative	the next_day the tracking_system showed that another failed delivery attempt had been made , though my note was untouched .
negative	then fedex suggested that i have the package sent to the local fedex store where i could pick it up the next_morning .
negative	after_contacting the fedex store the next_day , they told me that it would take 0 additional days for it to arrive at their office , since it was a saturday .
negative	so at the time of this writing , i have yet to receive this package .
negative	there is a zero percent chance that i will be willing to go through this again .
negative	the price was the only_thing good about this purchase .
negative	ordered january 0rd and i still have not received the filters .
negative	tracking says january_00th delivery ( 0_weeks ).
negative	customer service was a generic message that did not answer my original question of where is my order ???
negative	i will not likely order from air_filters delivered again .
negative	had ordered flowers for my grandmothers funeral in dublin on monday_evening .& i gave all the details of the funeral directors including there phone_number & the time i wanted the flowers to arrive on thursday .
negative	i was absolutely mortified to find out the flowers were not even sent & i only found this out on the friday via a email from iflorist sending there apologies for not fulfilling the order , i was
negative	absolutely disgusted & rang up there customer_services who were very apologetic , when i asked them why wasn_'_t i notified by phone the day before the funeral , they didn_'_t know & why was i sent a email on friday at 00 . 00 a whole day after the funeral had taken place ?
negative	what a absolute joke there customer_services are & why_advertise that you can deliver to places when you can '_t ?
negative	i made the terrible mistake of booking flights through bravofly .
negative	i booked flights from zanzibar tanzania to rwanda kigali .
negative	two flights , two airlines one booking .
negative	the first flight was with precision air from zanzibar to nairobi .
negative	the second with rwanda air from nairobi to kigali .
negative	there was a 0 . 0hr layover in nairobi .
negative	we we happy with the price and the timings .
negative	then rwanda airlines rescheduled the flight bringing it forward by over 0hrs leaving just over 0 hour layover .
negative	given there is no ability to check in online with rwanda airlines and you need to checkin 0hr before and clear immigration etc the rescheduled flight was no_longer suitable .
negative	i asked bravofly to put us on an earlier flight with precision air - they told me there were no earlier flights - a simple web search proved otherwise .
negative	i then asked for a refund so that i could make the change myself .
negative	they told me they would not give me a full_refund .
negative	given the rescheduling made the trip actually impossible i protested this .
negative	the staff_member refused to refer the matter to a supervisor and refused the full_refund .
negative	nearly a month later i am still_awaiting to find out how much bravofly will refund and am now out of pocket $_000 having booked alternative flights directly with the airline .
negative	do not use bravofly
negative	shortly_after_placing an order , i had to cancel ...... i never got a response from them after numerous tries of phone_call calls and emails but no answer to any .... i have been requesting a complete refund but have been completely_ignored .....
negative	the responce was making and the wrong part
negative	other then that everything was ok .
negative	it took me 00_minutes to book a straightforward car_hire on the phone with ebookers .
negative	they use an overseas call_centre and it was like drawing teeth , very painful .
negative	the call_centre operator did not know the basic elements of the product ; had to look them up from a script and coldn '_t answer follow - up questions .
negative	he kept repeating basic details as if i was 0 years old .
negative	a poor customer experience .
negative	you receive a lower price , but it comes with a customer service cost .
negative	advise you go elsewhere for a better experience
negative	not entirely satisfied with product .
negative	customer service is disgusting .
negative	will never use again .
negative	i tried to order a red chrome xbox_controller due to all websites being out of stock , so this popped_up on google shopping ( usually a good reliable_source ) ordered , the item went from in stock to out of stock .
negative	once i questioned about my order , i '_ve received no order and my money has_been taken out of my account !
negative	and struggling to try and find how to refund my payment !
negative	i '_m going to have to contract trading_standards .
negative	i did not receive what i ordered .
negative	than i need to fill_out a form to get the part returned .
negative	i get a reply asking for order number etc .
negative	just like the form i filled_out , but apparently they didn_'_t take the time to read the form .
negative	i answered the question in the same order as i was asked .
negative	they than send me another type of form for me to return the part i didn_'_t get !
negative	sent another email explaining all of this again .
negative	they do not have a phone_number to have this taken_care of , and every time you send in a form you wait 00 - 00_hours for a reply .
negative	this absolutely no way to conduct_business .
negative	i '_m guessing i will not receive the original part i ordered .
negative	i '_m sure i won_'_t do any business here again .
negative	than i find out they want me to pay the shipping on the part they sent to me wrong .
negative	no way !
negative	i ordered a $_00 . 00 part , and they sent me a $_00 . 00 part .
negative	i '_ll eat my loss & they can too !
negative	!
negative	gave_me an tail_light instead of head_light
negative	three_days ago , i bought something on a site and when i looked to my account , they ' re was nohing left !
negative	because paypal tried to get my money without my authorisation . and their customer service sucks a lot !
negative	be wise and never make an account with them .
negative	no comment at this time given the delay
negative	i ordered and payed for a part from parts_geek .... it arrived quickly but was the wrong part ..... after attempting to resolve the issue i was told i would have to reorder the correct part .... i did .... now i have two debits against my credit_card for the same part ...... after further review ... they told me i would have to pay the shipping on the returning freight for the wrong part ... eventhough it was their mistake ........ and according to their rules of returned items .... no refund would be granted unless the part was list below on the athorization letter .... the part listed was the part i had ordered not the part i wanted to return ..... so according to that i would not be given a refund ,,,, i have no luck reaching anyone by phone and no one has tried to call me eventhough i have asked them to do so ...... i thought i had found a good source for auto_parts but after this .... i will never use them again .... or recamend them to anyone ........ js
negative	first of all shipping is a bit of the issue !
negative	if you need a rush service then it is wrong place .
negative	0 - 0 days pressing before shipping is a norm .
negative	so , if you need 0 business day shipping be ready to wait for 0 -- 0 days and if you have 0 business days you have to wait for 0 - 0 at the best .
negative	looks_like rip_off to me .
negative	second - ordered contacts , open the box and opened container - ad see that lens is damaged , as well as 0 others .
negative	so out of 0 ordered 0 were bad already !
negative	again used opticontacts for almost 0 years and all of a sudden is past 0 months it went from good to terrible !
negative	stay_away !
negative	constantly switched off often within minutes of re - logging on .
negative	applied a free vpn and it worked great !
negative	don_'_t ever use those bandits .
negative	they didn_'_t send any confirmation to my booking and when calling the hotel , they told me that there have been no reservation made .
negative	booking . com had no problem regarding taking the money from my credit_card .
negative	silent they went when i wrote to them .
negative	don_'_t use them
negative	parts were not included that were shown in ad ,,, no telephone_number on website to talk to customer representative .
negative	sent email , no response .
negative	ordered a rim for my 00 cadillac and received the wrong rim .
negative	the box was marked correctly but rim inside was not for my vehicle . now i have to pay shipping and handling to send it back , and insure it . i really needed it at that time while my car was being inspected , now i have to stop back to have this changed after i buy the rim for my car from someone_else .
negative	first of all , it was hard to understand the person on the phone .
negative	i had to ask over and over what was being told to me .
negative	i knew approximately what the cost was going to be ( around $ 0000 .-$ 0000 .
negative	however , when she told me it was over $ 0000 . 00 .
negative	i lost my cool and told her to let_me speak to a supervisor .
negative	this request was repeated 0 or 0 times .
negative	i had to scream at het to let_me speak to a supervisor .
negative	what should have taken 00 to 00_minutes took over an_hour .
negative	time is money to me and i lost .
negative	the supervisor did come to the phone and took_care of the issue .
negative	for the price of this reservation i had better be impressed .
negative	i '_m sorry to come out like this but i '_m still fuming from the experience .
negative	i do not believe your hotel is going to make up for this treatment .
negative	i '_m afraid i '_m going to arrive expecting the red_carpet .
negative	company seemed great when booking the car for use in the netherlands .
negative	when checking in at the hertz_counter everything_went splendid .
negative	the rep there never informed me that i woul d be paying more in fees than i actually was paying for the rental .
negative	at the time of booking i was not made aware of this fact either .
negative	i was just to find out a month later when auto_europe charged me 000 for the rental ( which is what i thought i was paying total ).
negative	then hertz charges me 000 . 00 .
negative	customer service for auto_europe explained the breakdown of all the fees to me in a rude manner and treated me as if i was unintelligent .
negative	this is did not appreciate .
negative	i still can '_t get my head around the fact that i paid more in fees than i did for the rental .
negative	i think in the future auto_europe hpshould do a better job of letting the customer know that the rate you see in there website is not at all what you end up paying .
negative	this is the reason for the 0_star .
negative	i feel auto_europe mis informed / or kept things hidden from me the client .
negative	customer service is everything to me and the way i was treated on the phone was less_than satisfactory .
negative	i have had better call_center support out of india with an operator who bairly speaks_english .
negative	i expect more from a us based call_center .
negative	also for deja and any one else who reads this .
negative	when a customer ask for your name and a way to identify you within the company don_'_t lie .
negative	the companie does not offer exchanges , and when they sent me the wrong part i was expected to wait 0 - 0_weeks for the return to process and then order a new part when everything_went through , i would never order from them again !
negative	!
negative	fick fel spel levererad .
negative	the red_roof we stayed in san_antonio was dirty in bathroom , microwave didn_'_t work and i had to unplug the refrigerator so i could sleep !
negative	bad staff .
negative	wouldn_'_t tell me who the owner was .
negative	realy disapointed i have not receive any tickets !!
negative	order #_0000000
negative	my trip is schedule for june 0 and still don_'_t have my ticket on hand no phone_number to call because that phone_number listed that not answer , email is been send and still_waiting on reply :( to much money i wish some one see this things and help to get this resolve .
negative	i am preordered diablo_0 , but dont recieve my key for 0 days after realese and lost a lot of nerves .
negative	very bad service .
negative	ordering was easy , quick google_search brought up the part i needed .
negative	processing was easy ..... then comes the delivery ....
negative	ordered more than a week_ago .
negative	checked shipping tracking_number and it says ill get it next thursday .
negative	meaning it will have taken a day shy of two full weeks to get the part .
negative	i understand that 000 years_ago this would have taken much longer if even possible but in the competitive market today this is business suicide .
negative	why would i purchase here and not somewhere_else where it takes less then half the time to get my order ?
negative	no_longer can look at flight options over 0 - 0 before / after days .
negative	format change for auto rental is negative .
negative	have switched to orbitz after many_years , purchases .
negative	have made three_attempts for a rma_# and get no response , thanks
negative	i found the rate on line for the storage_unit , i made the reservation .
negative	the reservation did not say i would have to pay any mandatory additional monthly fees .
negative	however , when the woman from the site called me , she told me that there was a $_00 . 00 administration fee , and an_additional_charge for mandatory_insurance per_month .
negative	i told her i would not accept her mandatory_insurance , so she hung_up on me ...........
negative	you have to think that if this is the customer service personal that they are hiring ............
negative	very bad , i made orders and i never recibe .
negative	the company don_'_t explain what happens ?
negative	i easily went through the online booking process and made my hotel reservation effortlessly .
negative	due to a problem with internet_explorer , i was unable to print the booking confirmation .
negative	i called bookit . com , gave the employee my booking number , and asked her to please email me a copy of it , explaining the problem with my printer .
negative	she went to a supervisor for guidance and then told me to download google chrome to print the booking .
negative	i explained i was not about to do that and again asked her to email me a copy .
negative	she said she could not .
negative	i asked her to fax me a copy .
negative	during the 00_minutes of my time that was wasted on the phone , the employee put me on hold three_times .
negative	only after wasting 00_minutes of my time did she finally agreed to fax it to me .
negative	this is totally_unacceptable customer service .
negative	there were nine other hotel search_engines with the identical price for the room .
negative	i would have saved 00_minutes and the associated aggravation by using any one of them .
negative	in fairness , i should add that the employee was very pleasant throughout the conversation .
negative	she attempted to be helpful , but appeared not to have the knowledge or ability to respond appropriately .

negative	when i initially purchased the ring , their sales_representative selected a ring for me and told me that it was a white stone and was eye clean , with no visible inclusions .
negative	i had initially ordered the ring on 0 / 00 / 00 , and it was delivered on 0 / 00 / 00 .
negative	between 0 / 00 / 00 and 0 / 0 / 00 i was in europe where i proposed to my girlfriend .
negative	she didn_’ t say yes .
negative	i returned home and on 0 / 0 / 00 called brilliance to return the diamond_ring under their 00 - day return_policy .
negative	despite only being in possession of the ring for 00 days they informed me that they start counting the 00 day return from the order date , even_though they did not ship it until almost two_weeks after the order .
negative	i was speaking with <_name removed >, the ceo of brilliance who told me that he would try and sell the ring to another broker and return 00_% of my money if he was able to sell it , but said he would not give me a full credit return of my money in exchange for returning the ring .
negative	i have since spoken with him many_times over the past few weeks and we are unable to come to an agreement where he returns my credit , i have since returned the ring and he still refuses me credit citing that i missed the 00 day window .
negative	i didn_’ t really know anything about diamonds and wanted to have it checked to make_sure i at_least got what i had paid for out so i had taken the diamond_ring to a jewelry_store in san luis obispo to have it inspected and was alerted that the ring did not match the egl report , it was far lower in color and clarity .
negative	i was quite alarmed at hearing this and then started this chargeback process on that same day 0 / 00 / 00 due to the diamond being defective ( i . e .
negative	much less quality than it was sold to me as ).
negative	on my return to los_angeles i took the ring to advanced gemological laboratory , on 0 / 00 / 00 where a gia graduate gemologist , inspected the ring and prepared a quality confirmation report , which is attached .
negative	he found that the diamond was actually 0 color grades lower , and was a k color not an f . he also noted that the clarity was in fact an i0 with visible inclusions , 0 grades lower_than the egl report and brilliance ’_s appraisal listed at si0 .
negative	at the bottom part of the stone there is a white facet break that is visible to the eye making it an i0 .
negative	additionally , there are also 0 large black carbon deposits in the ring .
negative	this significantly lowers the value of the ring .
negative	these are significant defects that i did not expect to find in the ring based on brilliance ’_s gemological appraisal , which incidentally is also a conflict of interest as their ceo prepared it .
negative	the diamond is materially different from what was promised and sold to me , so much so that i believe this was fraud .
negative	thankfully i bought this ring with a credit_card and was able to do a charge back .
negative	two months later my credit_card company sent me a letter telling_me that they had investigated this and took my side , so i finally did manage to get my money back but it was an_absolute nightmare doing so .
negative	cannot recommend enough to buy your ring at a store where you can visually inspect it through a microscope .
negative	buyer_beware .

negative	probably the worst experience i '_ve ever had purchasing something on the internet
negative	i originally made an order online and was told it would be on back order for a week .
negative	i decided to wait .
negative	a week_later i was notified it would take an_additional two_weeks for back order .
negative	i decided to reorder .
negative	i don_'_t understand_why you aren_'_t updated your inventory online but i was willing to overlook the error .
negative	after getting an eye_exam and giving you all of the required information i was told the process would only take another week and a half .
negative	the eye glasses were sent out on time and were received within the time frame as well .
negative	but the left lens ' prescription was done incorrectly .
negative	i immediately called and was told by your employees that my glasses were done wrong .
negative	the quality control is lacking at your establishment .
negative	i hope this will be corrected soon .
negative	your employees make it seem like this happens all the time and its no big_deal .
negative	this will most_likely be the last time i order from your establishment .
negative	travelocity was virtually_impossible to reach by phone ; you were put on hold interminably for a half - hour or more ( i gave up repeatedly ); when i finally got through to change my reservations , i paid a change fee and additional_costs , but never got a confirmation .
negative	when i tried to call , i couldn_'_t get through ; travelocity '_s website said i had taken the original trip and had no pending reservations .
negative	so i cancelled my appointments , and my trip , only to get -- the day before the rescheduled date -- an invitation to check in from the airline and when i cancelled that reservation , a confirmation from travelocity of the changes i had made earlier .
negative	too_late .
negative	i am demanding a refund .
negative	guess what ?
negative	no word yet on this demand from travelocity

negative	they first questioned whether we had opened it .
negative	( duh ?
negative	how would we know if it was such poor quality if unopened ?)
negative	then they said we can only return it if we pay the postage .
negative	that is not acceptable .
negative	they are the ones selling poor quality merchandise and should pay for its return .
negative	the cost of postage will be half of the cost of the original merchandise .
negative	won_'_t order from this company again .
negative	they stole $ 0000 from me .
negative	they never mailed my washer and lied about everything .
negative	they said they would provide the tracking_number the day it was bought and i would get it within 0 days .
negative	they never sent it when i talked to them after a week they said it was shipped but they had not been able to put the tracking_information in yet .
negative	after waiting and waiting they never sent it .
negative	avoid this company
negative	ordered two_weeks_ago and just got the package .
negative	sure_enough it was all the wrong parts !
negative	i followed all the instructions on how to get the right parts and turns_out the web_page had it wrong .
negative	shopatron refused to pay for shipping and was rude on the phone !
negative	never use them again .
negative	amazon here i come !
negative	the book i ordered was given to another customer .
negative	i needed the book for school , and now i have no textbook for my class .
negative	the clerk said there was nothing she could do .
negative	this was after driving all the way across town to pick_up my book that i ordered .
negative	took twice as long as any other glasses i have orderd .
negative	prescription was not even close .
negative	frame was not level .
negative	did not have the thin lens that i payed extra for .
negative	so_far the company has not given me a refund after i returned them the next_day with proper rma .
negative	0 / 00 update after three_weeks i got a refund only after i opened a dispute whith my credit_card !!
negative	!
negative	i plan to not use this service .. twice_now they have lost my reservation .
negative	i travel almost weekly and can '_t afford this type of error .
negative	one of my flights had to be changed and i could not make that date , i lost $_000 . 00 .
negative	when i tried to use the credit , the fees that they tack on and the new flight actually cost more than the $_000 . 00 that i lost .
negative	the part i ordered was a side_mirror costing $_00 plus $_00 shipping .
negative	i received the wrong part .
negative	there is no way to contact the company other than email .
negative	they took two_days to respond to that .
negative	after a week of answering_questions i was told to ship the part back which i did .
negative	i asked them to send the correct part .
negative	instead they credited me the $_00 for the wrong part they sent .
negative	i did not receive credit for the shipping of the wrong part which ended_up costing me $_00 .
negative	i finally used another website and got the correct part within a few_days .
negative	placed an order on or about april00th .
negative	today is april 00st , my parts have not arrived .
negative	did not receive a detailed confirmation of my order as with my many previous_orders .
negative	did not receive a shipping notice or a tracking_number .
negative	was informned that a part was being backordered , but dio not know which part .
negative	filed a complaint with their customer service and expected a response w_/ in 00_hours or less , but did not receive a response .
negative	now i sit here not knowing if even a partial order was shipped , or will be shipped .
negative	if my order is not received by april 00nd i will find another parts dealer and refuse to pay pq '_s charge to my credit_card
negative	dissatisfied
negative	i had a problem processing a multiple parts order with paypal that for some reason would only allow me to order each item individually .
negative	i emailed the so called " sales_team ", alerted them of my situation and forwarded a detailed list with ebay item #'_s and
negative	the parts mfg .
negative	part #'_s asked them to enter my complete order and ship together so i could save some $$ on combined shipping .
negative	the only response i got was an ebay invoice for the original first part ordered period ... no followup or response whatsoever !!!
negative	from the so called " sales_team " ( no salesperson '_s name that i could contact directly ) just the sales_team .
negative	0 .
negative	i assume it was just too much_trouble , for whomever to enter and process my complete order ..
negative	0 .
negative	they lost sales because of their lack of respect for this customer ...
negative	0 .
negative	they lost my future business !
negative	one other thing , their usps shipping rates are grossly inflated , compared to their competitors ( which i discovered when i took my busines elsewhere ...)
negative	i will never do_business with car parts kings , ever again !
negative	extremely disappointed !!!!!!!!
negative	p . s .
negative	they will also receive a negative_feedback on their ebay status ....
negative	very best regards , stephen phillips
negative	do not use cash0phones .
negative	please read below .
negative	i am disgusted .
negative	after sending 0 phones , none with any great value , the response was to pay full price £_00 . 00 on an old nokia 0000 , but reduce htc wildfire price from approc £_00 to £_00 . 00 .
negative	it was in far better condition and more in demand !
negative	in addition , they changed the value of a very old phone from £ 0 to £ 0 ( yes zero ) so were able to record it as " accepted " with no comeback !
negative	i emailed to say not acceptable on two counts , got an_email back to say please logon and review your revised offers .
negative	duly did this and there was no change !
negative	i was due to go on holiday the next_morning for a week , so from the airport sent a further email to say i was not happy and was only contactable in next week via_email .
negative	cash0phones ignored my email and converted the htc to accepted as it passed their 0 day stipulation .
negative	on my return i phoned to make a pretty full on complaint , but the response was tough , the phone has already been processed and is no_longer yours - no comeback , and no acceptance of them being at fault .
negative	when i suggested to the girl on the phone ( who was only doing her job following instructions from thieving bosses ) that she should be better_than working for those theives , she went very quiet .
negative	i sensed she agreed with me .
negative	in summary - i was robberd of one ohone and ripped_off with another
negative	do not use - scam - do not use - scam - do not use - scam - do not use - scam - do not use - scam - do not use - scam - do not use - scam - do not use - scam - do not use - scam - do not use - scam - do not use - scam - do not use - scam - do not use - scam - do not use - scam - do not use - scam - do not use - scam - do not use - scam - do not use - scam -
negative	ordered a fuel_filter , got a strut_mount .
negative	asked for resolution , got a fulfillment confirmation and rating request
negative	first time user , last time ever
negative	not my kinda place ..
negative	i '_m out !
negative	!
negative	i ordered hundreds of jerseys from them last_year and had nothing but great things to say about them .
negative	this year a total 000 degree turn .
negative	horrible customer service , no responses to e_-_mails .
negative	shipped ems instead of dhl and it took over a month to get here .
negative	the team that needed them for a specific ride did not get them ...
negative	kept writing and writing the company with no response !
negative	i am still trying to get a hold of them and they refuse to answer any e_-_mails .
negative	last_year i would have told everyone to buy from them ...
negative	but with whatever change has happened i hate to say this because i really_liked them but if you need clothing for cycling do not order from here !!!!!
negative	run as fast as you can to anywhere_else !
negative	i ordered floor_mats for my 0000_lexus gs000 rwd .
negative	they are listed on the web_site as available ( the manufacture states that they do not make mats for my car ).
negative	they were delivered in a timely_manner but wrong fit .
negative	after much difficulty , i found a telephone # and called ; there was no argument , but also no admittance that it was their fault before i received a ran .
negative	i had to assume the shipping cost ($_00 . 00 for them to refund my $_000 ).
negative	they received the package ( fedex tracking ), but have not received any acknowledgment via_email or telephone .
negative	they state that it will be about 00 days before credit is given .
negative	why so long .
negative	they took it out of my credit_card on the same day of sale .
negative	this company is not doing the customer , or itself any good .
negative	it needs to cease and disappear .
negative	i will wait and see when , and if i will receive my credit .
negative	since they made the mistake (?
negative	), my shipping_charges should be included in the refund .
negative	they didn_'_t have customer service at all
negative	it may not have been protein_works fault , as the delivery company delivered parcel to wrong_address and i was unable to retrieve it !
negative	very disappointed .
negative	ordered 0000 - 0000_gmc envoy accessory belt idler_pulley - ac_delco 00000 .
negative	it is an belt tensioner pulley & had to go to local parts shop to get correct one to finish job .
negative	dimensions in description would help .
negative	feel_like i '_m getting the run around on trying to return part ; still_waiting on rma #.
negative	still_hasn_'_t arrived
negative	very poor .
negative	no automated email updated on delivery .
negative	despite stated hours of sat service no answer during the 0 hours of me phoning - all operators were apparently busy all day !
negative	so_far failed to deliver , failed to update , and failed to be available during stated working hours - if i could give less_than a one star service i would .
negative	lets_hope my goods for which payment has already left my bank_account are actually delivered .
negative	at this stage the worst online purchase system i have every used lets_hope things will improve or this will be the last time i and my friends use this website - back to lovell for me .
negative	i purchased a solar_cover for a customer and when i opened it and put it on the pool surface it was a mile out of square .
negative	the customer was not happy and i was not happy , but i could not possibly fold it back up and return it ... after several hours of trimming and fitting it is on the pool .... out of square looking but functional ..
negative	i lost my profit on the job to make the customer semi_- happy .. two_days latter the customer called and said the protective cover that was included with the solar_cover was 0 ' feet short ... sure_enough it was the wrong_size ... talking to customer service , they told me that the 00 foot x 00 inch protective cover was just a sample and i could purchase the right size cover for the solar_cover .... wtf are they talking_about .... i have purchased dozens of solar covers and they all come with the white plastic_cover ....
negative	they did offer to replace the solar_cover if i sent them a sample which i did , but have not heard back ..... never again
negative	i don_'_t know why but i '_m asking for a 0000_bmw_000i the part and they send me the wrong part .
negative	the situation is that is more_expensive the shipping for send back for change
negative	i buy a lot of stuff online and i had never had to wait this long for receiving my order .
negative	you need to get better logistics and improve your delivery time .
negative	i will think_twice before ordering from you again .
negative	sometimes is better to pay more for a product than to wait longer .
negative	i was definitely happy to save_money on the part but it took a week and a half for the part to arrive .
negative	with the fact of not having my car for that long and spending money on a rental , the savings on the part was obsolete .
negative	checking out online didn_'_t give the option for any kind of express delivery and when i called customer service , they had me on hold for too_long .
negative	first red_flag ..... this company contracts through expedia .
negative	it '_s not clearly_stated .
negative	our hotel clerk confirmed this and was unable to assist in changing the reservation .
negative	second red_flag ..... they hi - jacked the days inn name making you think that you are dealing_with their reservation service .
negative	third red_flag .
negative	... their telephone servers are trained to trick you by mixing up your dates .
negative	this company operates at the level of legal scammers and are getting away with it .
negative	guess i had to learn the hard way .
negative	from now on i will call the hotel_directly .
negative	i ordered a head_light from parts_geek and never revived anything from them .
negative	called ups and they said it was parts_geek fault .
negative	they gave ups a different shipping address .
negative	no number to call parts_geek .
negative	all they have is a fax_number ( that no one response ) or you have to put in a sumit ticked and wait til they get_ahold of you ( can take up to 00 - 00 ) hrs .
negative	it '_s been over 00hrs and still no response from them .
negative	send in a reply to the sumit ticket and still no response from them .
negative	my opion is this is a bogus site and all the do is send you stuff that doesn_'_t match what you ordered or you get no response from anyone from parts_geek .
negative	it a shame that companies out here can be on the internet and sell faulse advertisement .
negative	there should be a law to punish people who take_advantage of people that are trying to get what they need and go own with thier life '_s .
negative	bottom_line .
negative	you pay for it you should get it .
negative	trustpilot is seo spam .
negative	and stopp nagging me to leave a review of you !
negative	i love b and h . great site and service .
negative	but for gods sake stop annoying your customers by having them do your job for you !
negative	!
negative	the travelocity experience was interesting !
negative	travelocity charged me $_00 and days inn charged me $_00 .
negative	i had to call my credit_card co . and have dispute the days inn charge
negative	i don_'_t think i '_ve experiences customer service like it .
negative	if your parcel is lost then you have to wait 00 days before you can claim .
negative	then you have to fill_out a form and post it to them before they '_ll accept your claim .
negative	this ridiculous amount of time and convoluted process makes it a real_pain to shop with them .
negative	i '_m not going through that again and i would advise others not to either .
negative	still_waiting for credit voucher from travelocity !
negative	horrible service and no english_speaking supervisors to speak with !
negative	to slow , to exspensive
negative	placed an online order with giftcards . com for two gift_cards , one with a custom picture and one with a stock picture .
negative	i got an_email within an_hour saying my order had been cancelled because it did not meet the gift_card guidelines .
negative	i called the next_day to ask why the order was cancelled but was put on hold and told 00_minutes later that they could not get through to that department but would submit a customer service ticket and that someone would get back to me within an_hour .
negative	i also sent an_email inquiry with the same question .
negative	the next_day i received an_email that my order was cancelled because it did not meet the giftcard guidelines .
negative	i sent another email and asked to be more specific and again the next_day received an_email_saying that the custom picture i had submitted was a copywrited picture and thus could not be printed .
negative	again i asked , but how come the stock picture card was also cancelled and i have yet to receive a response .
negative	have a nice life giftcards . com as you have horrible customer service .
negative	e_- bay is the worst ever .
negative	they have gone downhill over the past couple of years .
negative	there selling policy for members who have been with them for 00 years or longer with 000_% perfect feedback is insulting .
negative	i have gone to amazom and had very good luck .
negative	i used to think of amazon only for books .
negative	not any more , you can get anything there that you can on e_- bay .
negative	before placing my order , i asked luxury of watches if they could guarantee that the watch that i wanted would be delivered within 00 days .
negative	the sales_rep confirmed that i ' d get it .
negative	after several weeks and much frustrating follow_up via phone and email , a customer service rep indicated that they would not be able to meet their commitment .
negative	then he / she made a unilateral decision to cancel my order .
negative	luxury of watches was quick in charging $ 0 , 000 + against my credit_card .
negative	but very slow in responding to calls and emails .
negative	the store failed to deliver on its guarantee .
negative	terrible shopping_experience .
negative	i was sold a defective_part . now i have to re move part send it back to them and i get to pay the shipping to them . order a new part and again i get to pay the shipping of the new part back to me and i get to reinstall the part one more time not knowing if it is good or not . i '_m not happy that there is no way to talk to a human , and i have a car down for 0 - 00 days waiting on shipping .
negative	poor service , poor support poo performance
negative	be warned : every_single one of the good reviews are from people using their site being asked to post here for " monthly prize drawings ".
negative	after you purchase a cd_key from them they give you a link to this page and tell you that if you post a review you '_ll be entered into a montly prize drawing .
negative	i am posting to warn you of this not to be entered into a fucking drawing .
negative	i '_m sure they won_'_t anyways with the truth im about to spew .
negative	when you order , if you don_'_t have a landline which matches the address you provided ( who has a landline these days ) then they are going to ask you for a copy of your photo_id and a copy of a utility bill with the address you provided them .
negative	if you don_'_t provide that you will not get your cd_key .
negative	and by the way you have to provide this on ever single cd_key .
negative	the cd_keys are delayed as well , i waited over 0 days to receive a cd - key for bioshock_infinite , during which time i missed a steam sale for the game .
negative	i have been through this company 0 times and each time it was a hassle .
negative	you will get a working cd_key but is it worth 0 hours of emails to you per game ?
negative	if you don_'_t mind bugging the hell out of their reps , arguing with them and trying to get what you paid for ... then try this service .
negative	i saved only 00 bucks on bioshock and in hindsight id have bought it new to avoid the 0 hours of emails and 0 days of waiting .
negative	they also are incompetent when it comes to paypal accounts and have no_idea how to process orders .
negative	you better make_sure your paypal_account info matches exactly with all the info you provided or guess what .
negative	no cd_key .
negative	worst company i have ever done business with in my lifetime .
negative	friends and i was waiting 0 hours at the check in , in hamburg airport .
negative	they did not give us a reason_why we were waiting .
negative	i guess their system was f * cked .
negative	when we were going home again and should check our baggage in , they told us to pay 00 ,- euro for each suitcase .
negative	and we had 0 suitcases !
negative	because there was a really long queue , we did not want to complain at the counter .
negative	i can '_t recommend you to buy tickets from vueling .
negative	to all business owners :
negative	business - in - a - box is a crock !
negative	nothing every works after you pay $_000 for using the software the magic disappears .
negative	i thought it would be a handy tool but , nothing works and all i '_m ever given is a non working application and constant reminders to upgrade and renew -- even_though i have .
negative	great concept poor performance .
negative	you suck business - in - a - box !
negative	what a group of frauds .
negative	they restricted my account for no reason so they could hold onto £_000 of my money - six_months it took to get it out of them !
negative	!
negative	sent them emails , get no response .
negative	post questions on items page , they don_'_t put up the question .
negative	how am i suppose to contact these_people if they don_'_t respond to questions and delete the question off the item page ?
negative	i highly_recommend ordering elsewhere .
negative	i did not like it !
negative	i got the wrong item and i want a full_refund !
negative	poor quality and they messed_up my business cards
negative	i ordered a part on line .
negative	i paid a fair price plus shipping .
negative	within 0 days the part arrived .
negative	however , the part turned_out to be the wrong part in a box that had the right part number stamped on it .
negative	i tried to call partsgeek only to find out they have no phone service that actually receives customer problems .
negative	i had to fill_out a on line ticket .
negative	i received one response with a question .
negative	i answered the question immediately .
negative	it '_s been a week now and my vehicle is still missing the parts it needs and i have heard absolutely nothing from them .
negative	hey - things_happen .
negative	would have rated 0_stars had the company been attentive to the problem and tried to fix it .
negative	gonna have to go with one for lack of customer service and the fact no one has gotten back with me to resolve this issue .
negative	i ordered parts & when i tried to call with a question i was on hold for over 00_minutes .
negative	i finally hung_up .
negative	when i got through the next_day i was sent to a voice_mail box that was full .
negative	their website sent me to an off site shipping company that wanted to debit my credit_card $_00 . 00 a month for " shipping privileges ".
negative	other_companies have the parts i ordered & cancelled from paertgeek .
negative	no need to ever go back there .
negative	i had to wait 00 days after filling_out two support_ticket because , i didn_'_t receive part # lf0x - 00 - 000 in my order #_0000000 dated 0 / 00 / 00 so they can refund my purchase , which i didn_'_t ask for , i just wanted the part i order sent to me .
negative	i couldn_'_t contacted your csd by phone .
negative	pathetic .
negative	they never answer there phone if you need help forget it never will deal with them again and its all over there customer service there is none
negative	i reserved through autoeurope which i have done many_times before with satisfaction .
negative	this time the car was booked through guerin car_rental in portugal .
negative	after a one hour plus wait to reach the counter , i was greeted_by a person_who insisted that i purchase unwanted insurance ( i was already covered through other plans ). for about 000_euros or else they would have to get an authorization on my visa for 00 , 000_euros ( twenty one thousand , eight hundred euros ).
negative	secondly , there is a service " toll service " that they explain very poorly .
negative	bottom_line they want to push the rental of a transponder and when the service is declined they leave the transponder in the car without advising you or disclosing the total costs of administration fees that will follow .
negative	my understanding is that they can add up to 00 euros per identification - don_'_t know what that means .
negative	in general , the service was rude in all 0 locations that i visited .
negative	i wasn_'_t the only one - there were people with issues in all three .
negative	the second location was especially severe as there were 0 customers ahead of me with extremely vocal complaints .
negative	two other customers came in after me for complaints as well .
negative	i have rented_cars in europe many_times ( over 00 different times ) - never experienced anything like i have with guerin .
negative	my recommendation ?
negative	- don_'_t use them .
negative	great prices .... slow service .
negative	is there anyone there ?
negative	we booked and paid for a hotel in pacific grove california .
negative	we received a confirmation and even a reminder that the date was coming up .
negative	when we got to the sunset inn , the hotel clerk , barbara was terrific but told us they did not have any reservation in our name .
negative	she told us that it was not unusual with expedia and it had happened several_times before .
negative	barbara found us another hotel .
negative	i called expedia to ask for an explanation and a refund and all i got was kelly who kept telling_me " no problem ".
negative	kelly was in india and i told her there was a problem .
negative	she refunded my money but never apologized or offered any solution .
negative	i have contacted expedia 0 times for an explanation and have received nothing back .
negative	never again !!!!
negative	!
negative	i am retired .
negative	my income is from social_security , no pension .
negative	i use windows x p . i have upgraded five time my microsoft widows xp without_any_problems .
negative	late last_year i inadvertantly deleted my " office " software ..
negative	i searched for a replacementand found software cw .
negative	iboughtand downloaded the 0000 edition of " office ".
negative	when i trid to install it in my computer i was notified that the 0000 version is not compatible with windows_xp .
negative	accordingly , i asked the distributor for my money back .
negative	they have refused0
negative	my complaint is that there should be a disclaimer associated with the purchase , not after the fact .
negative	softwarecw shouldewilling to refund my money since they have lost knothing .
negative	i wa about to order prescription dog_food which i have in the past , and asked the representative if she would honor a " free " shipping e_-_mail i received from pet fdood direct ?
negative	she told me they do not honor any promotions or sales from competitors .
negative	i said all i requested was the free shipping ?
negative	( even_though your price was $ 0 . 00 more .
negative	she still refused .
negative	i told her thank_you , and went back to pet_food direct and placed my order .
negative	shame that in these economic_times a company is not compoetive ?
negative	any even i told her to take my name off the email list , since i will be buying from pet_food direct from now on .
negative	i explained the sistuation to customer service about what happened .
negative	they also can see that my package was deliverd incorrectly .
negative	0wd have decided to have the post_office return the package that was delivered incorrectly by ups , instead of .
negative	i see what happened and we 0wd will send out the one little part that can make or break an off roading trip right out to you .
negative	i do understand that mistakes and crazy things_happen .
negative	but to play the wrong card of wait and see is not a way to fix a problem .
negative	i needed this tool to get my jeep up and running , nope the local parts store doesn_'_t carry it .
negative	so , my vote is piss_poor customer service , these_guys need to take a page out of kroger '_s customer service play book .
negative	if a mistake happens , don_'_t use the wait and see card , just help the customer out and replace the item the customer needs .
negative	it has_been three_weeks .
negative	for the sum of $ 0 . 00 0wd has lost a customer for life .
negative	it serves only to indoctrinate ppl into believing what the government wants them to believe .
negative	sad actually .
negative	do not deal with this company !
negative	i placed an order for a wardrobe ( which arrives in 0 parts ) and chest of drawers .
negative	after waiting 0_weeks for delivery i was told on the day of delivery ( and taking a day off work ) that the delivery was cancelled .
negative	i then received an_email_stating that it would be coming 0 days_later and that if was not there to receive it i would be liable to a £_00 fine .
negative	after taking another day off work the delivery came two_days_later however there was damage to all 0 parts of the wardrobe and the chest of drawers - chipped paint work , split wood , poor joints , the list goes on .
negative	i had to return all items as the quality was appalling for the price i had paid .
negative	i then had to contact pinesolutions the next_day ( they did not contact me despite me emailing them urgently on the day of delivery ) and received appalling customer service .
negative	i was told that it would take 00 - 00 weeks to replace the order and that the damage would have been caused_by the delivery driver ( the driver warned me of this and said that because it happens so often he made a point of unwrapping the items in front of me ).
negative	there is no way this damage was caused in transit , it was just poor manufacture and quality control .
negative	i received no apology from pinesolutions and they seemed very aggrieved that i had sent the order back .
negative	i cancelled the order and will never deal with this company again and strongly_advise against anyone doing so .
negative	i immediately tried to leave_feedback on pinesolutions ' own site yet it seemed they had disabled my account to prevent me doing so ( i tried the ' password reset ' function several_times in case it was me forgetting my password but they would not allow me access to leave_feedback ).
negative	" repackaged " wrong parts sent .
negative	i had to send them back at my expense !
negative	no " oops , sorry ", no " how can we make this right ".
negative	i will never order from them again .
negative	i bought a tag_heuer watch from dexclusive . com as a new watch .
negative	it broke , when i took to local tag_heuer dealer they confirmed it was a refurbished watch .
negative	contacted dexclusive . com , they replied : " we never state we sell only new watches "!
negative	look at their website , they state they only sell new watches !!
negative	!
negative	very disappointed with lack of service .
negative	charged for parts they didn_'_t send and have tried for many days to reach them .
negative	even via_email they fail to resolve the issue .
negative	the sony pvr was not compatible with my tv and audio system , hdmi connections as against scart .
negative	i contacted hispeck and was advised that if i returned it i would be charged a 00_% deduction and have to pay £ 0 post and package .
negative	the pvr was not installed as when i unwrapped it i could see that it would not connect .
negative	i advised the service assisant of this but she was instant that it was now second_hand .
negative	i am still considering what i should do as i believe my consumer_rights have been flouted .
negative	i sent a parcel in december , paid_extra for two day shipping , it took over a week for them to deliver it and now they ' re trying to charge the recipient ( whose a low income single_mom ) an extra $_00 dollars !
negative	i just received a call that they '_ve threatened to send the recipient to a collection agency .
negative	i '_ve called fedex three_times and emailed them , i '_ve tried to be as polite as possible and they '_ve only given me the run around .... which is exactly_what i should have expected ...
negative	in my opinion , anyone whose given them 0_stars is either completely and absolutely without defense mentally ill or a spammer .
negative	it '_s obvious fedex doesn_'_t care about quality of service , they only care about stealing from anyone whose fallen into their trap .
negative	worst experience ever .
negative	the one and only reason i use red_roof is because they allow pets .
negative	i spent 00_minutes trying to get my reservation extended .
negative	i even had my confirmation number and they are unable to find the number .
negative	and i forgot this part the most_important part they sent me to the wrong location !
negative	i ordered persol po0000v - 000 - size 00 on march_00th , 0000 .
negative	after waiting over three_weeks , i reached out to sbg asking where my glasses were .
negative	their site says they aim to respond to emails within 00_hours , which seems to be a boldface lie or a complete failure .
negative	a couple more weeks went by until they came back saying they could not get the glasses i ordered .
negative	they sent me other suggestions , and i opted for one , same style , but smaller sized lens .
negative	i received them soon after and they looked too small .
negative	keep in mind , they advertise a 00 day return / 0day exchange policy .
negative	i " requested " a return / exchange because they have to respond back with a special code and address .
negative	today is day 0 after my request and time is ticking_away and still no actual response with code and address ... just an auto - response .
negative	now i am afraid i will be stuck with glasses that do not fit because they fail to respond in a timely_manner and they failed to get me the glasses i originally ordered .
negative	the responses i have received have not been rude in content , but i find the lack of attention as a paying customer rude and tacky .
negative	i certainly hope my situation gets resolved , but i would not suggest smart buy glasses to anyone .

negative	i made my order on 0 / 00 / 00 , it is now 0 / 00 / 00 and i have not received my package .
negative	i don_'_t know who is responsible for this , but no one is giving me any answers .
negative	i will not be purchasing from you again , and if anyone is reading this , i recommend not to purchase from these_people as they don_'_t take responsibility for their orders .
negative	the price was good but only the color ink worked .
negative	the black_ink would not been regconize by my hp print .
negative	ik_heb een klacht gestuurd naar regiobloemist en_niet eens een antwoord ontvangen !
negative	bloemen waren van slechte kwaliteit_en na drie dagen klaar voor_de afvalbak .
negative	het bijhorende kaartje was slordig met foute tekst bijgevoegd .
negative	mits een schadeloosstelling , welke ik_niet verwacht aangezien er niet eens gereageerd word op_een klacht , zal ik zeker géén gebruik meer maken van deze diensten .
negative	zoals hierboven al vermeld waardeloos !!!
negative	!
negative	when duplicate reservations are mistakenly made , i found it extremely challenging to resolve the issue .
negative	it took 0 major phone_calls , a final discussion with a supervisor to resolve the issue .
negative	as big as travelocity is , i would think there customer service for these kinds of issues would be much_better and less_stressful to resolve
negative	we operate a family restaurant , we offer food catering on the side to make extra money .
negative	we had 0 clients that paid catering deposit fees through wepay .
negative	the first transaction of $_000 went through and successfully deposited to our bank_account .
negative	the other 0 transactions valued at $_000 , were held by wepay .
negative	wepay told us , that they are reviewing our company .
negative	they assured me that the payments should clear soon after the verification_process is completed .
negative	after 00 days of waiting , wepay closed my account citing our company was a " high risk ".
negative	we lost our $_000 that was held my wepay .
negative	we are currently in the process of writing a complaint with the bbb and considering taking wepay to small court .
negative	to all the business owners out there : do not use wepay !
negative	you will not get your money !
negative	i ordered 0 items from the site .
negative	one item came in broken .
negative	there was no way to contact anyone by phone so we went through the whole e_-_mail tag process to get a return approval .
negative	had to pay for the shipping of the broken item which cost me more then item itself ... will not buy from this site again
negative	i ordered a replacement rear_tail_light_lens for 0000 escape in mid - march -- i received notice that it had been shipped , but i never received .
negative	after i returned from month - long trip at end of april and still had not received the replacement lens , i wrote to parts_geek .
negative	they responded_promptly and said they would check into the situation .
negative	they emailed a couple days_later informing_me i would receive a refund -- but only of the purchase price , not the $ 0 shipping i also paid .
negative	worse yet , they said it would be credited to credit_card it was charged on .
negative	that card is no_longer active !!
negative	!
negative	i tried to call parts_geek but was never able in four calls to get a live_person to explain the situation .
negative	never use again
negative	i ordered a tonneau cover for my truck put the yr make and model and it gave_me the one i searched and ordered it thinking that it would fit my truck .
negative	it did not said right on the box 0000 - 0000 and my truck is a 0000 !
negative	jeg_vil da håbe de forbedre deres leveringstid fra 0 uger til_en_uge .
negative	i '_ve used cjs previously on 0 occassions other than this , and i '_ve had plain text for the key , easy to read and just copied and pasted into origin without_any problem .
negative	then i buy simcity for £_00 , and get sent a scanned purple picture of a key which will origin will not accept .
negative	tried at_least 00 times replacing o '_s with 0 '_s , 0s with bs , even 0s with gs .
negative	the response time of 00 - 00_hours is terrible .
negative	please take my warning , do not use this site .
negative	taking your money takes seconds , sorting_out an issue takes days .
negative	after booking my family vacation i thought everything was fine , but to my surprise when i arrived at the airport i was turned away from the rental_car company for not having a valid credit_card ...
negative	i was never told that by anyone not travelocity nor hertz .
negative	the car_rental company ... i had to go to another car_rental company and pay 000 , 00 for my week a whopping 000 . 00 more than i had booked my rental through travelocity .. wow you would think that travelocity would reimbursm me the the difference yeah right never that so i will go to price line or kayak for future travel planning ...
negative	well i bought a replacement_headlight for my ford_fusion .
negative	after it was installed the beam was pointing straight down .
negative	my fog_lights pointed farther .
negative	so i went to adjustment them by the adjustment and it was broken .
negative	it was loose and just turned without tilting the headlight up or down .
negative	for spending my money i expect for a main part to work .
negative	bad order , bad response , bad attitude , what more could go_wrong ?
negative	i ordered a traktor s0 mk0 mixer last tuesday 0rd december , it said guaranteed delivery by wednesday .
negative	after calling them when it was getting late wednesday i was told it was actually out of stock but will_definitely be thursday , thursday comes no delivery - i am then told there were some processing issues but its all sorted and will_definitely be with me friday .
negative	friday , and the weekend pass with no delivery .
negative	i call them monday and am told they wont be here for another two_days ?!
negative	meaning i ordered it on tuesday the 0rd of december and it wont be with me until the 00th of december .
negative	i had two events i was suppose to be djing ( my old mixers died unfortunately ), meaning i have now lost a lot of money and potentially future work due to decks .
negative	the only compensation i was offered was a discount on a future shop ( which embarrassingly for them they automatically emailed to ever person_who has made an order anyway ) - safe to say i will not be using them again .
negative	they did always answer the phone , but each person you speak with has a different " guaranteed time " story or a different reason_why its being delayed .
negative	unacceptable .
negative	i was sent the wrong part .
negative	i called the 0 - 000 number on the package slip and couldn_'_t get through to a service representative .
negative	i was on hold for approximately 00_minutes listening to music before hanging up .
negative	i '_m still holding the wrong part which i cannot even use .
negative	i '_m a very unhappy customer
negative	i placed an order for parts fir my 0000_mercedes , the accepted order , charged my visa and i waited to receive my parts .
negative	i desperately_needed the parts and after a week of not receiving i learned that they canceled the order only by logging on and checking status .
negative	they never even notified me that order was cancelled .
negative	no telephone_number anywhere so you cant call and talk to anyone .
negative	do not use them !
negative	i most_likely will never buy from them again .
negative	i have had the worst experience .
negative	i think they have lost my package its been 0_weeks since i ordered it and it still_hasnt arrived i call and they can '_t seem to help me fedex has lost it i will want my refund even if i lose 00_%
negative	if someone wants to pay the high price for overnight air why would a company take its sweet time over 0 business days to process an order ?
negative	if you need a product quickly due to a medical issue you should probably looks else where to get it .
negative	booked 0 rooms for 0 nights through ebookers .
negative	within 0 minutes of booking , i realised i had booked the correct days , but in the wrong month .
negative	i contacted ebookers , and they told me that the rooms i had booked were non_- refundable , so i was going to lose both rooms for all 0 nights .
negative	i know that i made the error , and would have accepted paying a fee for this error , but to lose the whole lot ?
negative	ebookers told me that there was nothing they could do , as it was down to the hotel .
negative	surely ebookers should be able to negotiate on your behalf , and only be dealing_with reputable hoteliers ?
negative	i won_'_t book through them again .
negative	shipping is very late , overcharged , englisch are worst stuff i ever talked .
negative	you should never ever buy anything here unless you want to get trouble !
negative	i got a reservation at carlson properties in baxter mn on saturday 00 / 00 / 0000 .
negative	when i figured_out i had the wrong date , i called them and tried to cancel the reservation , the reason i say tried is that they told me that i got the reservation canceled but they still_haven_'_t e_- mailed me about this .
negative	they told me it might take awhile for the e_-_mail because of my internet service , but the reservation showed_up immediately and now i have to go through this all over again .
negative	let_me know if you would like me to send you a transcript of the ridiculous conversation that we had .
negative	when i eventually got a telephone_number to call in the uk ( not available on your website ), the person was very helpful and responsive .
negative	shame i couldn_'_t have talked to someone in the uk from the start .
negative	bad pictures in case they are not car friendly
negative	placed an order and the payment failed but the money was took from my credit_card .
negative	for the last_week i have been trying to contact someone to help me and after 0 phone_calls and 0 emails i have still been unable to speak to anyone .
negative	very poor with no customer service whatsoever .
negative	when you speak to them they all tell you the same thing that a manager will get back to you and only a manager can sort this problem out .
negative	avoid this company at all cost .
negative	i purchased league of legends rp codes online .
negative	the codes did not work and no refunds are available .
negative	the fees on the cards are steep also .
negative	will not be using this website again .
negative	booked flights , bravofly accepted payment , next_day bravofly cancelled booking with no_explanation .
negative	money was refunded and i ended_up purchasing tickets for the same flights , same times on orbitz .
negative	still have no_idea why flight was cancelled .
negative	went to your site .
negative	went through the order process , and then found items not in stock .
negative	had to cancel .
negative	wasted my time .
negative	should have known when placing the order that the items were not in stock .
negative	will not be at your site again .
negative	perhaps the worst accommodation in my 00 + years of travel experience .
negative	the room was smelly .
negative	the sheets were wrinkled and old .
negative	the beds were old and torn apart .
negative	some appliances did not work and were dirty and falling_apart .
negative	insects were crawling all over the place .
negative	the hotel staff were sitting around smoking anywhere that they could be found .
negative	thanks to bookit that cancelled my reservation and charged me one night plus some fees and let_me get out of there .
negative	the reviews that i read about the place should have been written by the hotel staff themselves !
negative	this should be no reflection on the hotel staff but its management or rather mismanagement !
negative	after selecting a room and the amount of nights i was going to stay i was provided with a total dollar_amount and tax that would be charged to my card .
negative	after putting in all of my card info and clicking book it the price changed to $_00 higher and then come to find out after calling the hotel there is a resort_fee i will have to pay once i check in that if was never told about .
negative	i cancelled and booked directly through the hotel , it was cheaper that way .
negative	i ordered some chrome lug_nuts from parts_geek .
negative	they took 00 days to arrive .
negative	when they finally got here they were rusted inside the package .
negative	i hope customers service pulls through .
negative	this is the second time we have used this organization .
negative	the first was at the hilton caribe in san juan .
negative	we did not know we had booked with someone other than the hotel and the hotel was not sure we had reservations !!
negative	because of the vehicle we used for obtaining the reservation , we did not earn_points .
negative	and we had to pay immediately upon booking .
negative	( six_months in advance )
negative	this time , we booked and realized we had made the same mistake , cancelled with this firm and made the reservation directly with the hotel at the same rate without having to forfeit points or paying immediately .
negative	i do not understand the value of this organization or why hotels utilize this ' service '.
negative	the worst customer service and overall experience ever !!
negative	i ordered flowers for my wife , who was in the chapel hill , nc area for business .
negative	i ordered them on saturday for a sunday delivery , as was available on the avas_flowers website .
negative	i paid for the arrangement and delivery .
negative	then , i received an_email on sunday that said they were unable to deliver the arrangement on sunday , due to the flowers not being available .
negative	after being hung_up on once , i finally got through to speak to their customer service .
negative	i was told they had no flowers instock .
negative	they said there was absolutely nothing they could do to get the flowers to my wife on sunday , even_though the website guaranteed sunday deliver , and i paid for it .
negative	they did offer the deliver the flowers first thing monday_morning , but that was not what i had ordered .
negative	they again told me that they had no flowers at all in the shop to deliver .
negative	when i asked to speak to a manager , i was originally told that there was no manager available , but was eventually connected to a manager ( after a very long hold ).
negative	they told me that the floral shop was locally owned , but the owner was not available and they had no_idea when he would be available , [_name ].
negative	i asked if they had anything they could deliver today , sunday , and i was told that they had absolutely nothing .
negative	we are not from the area .
negative	i tried to find a local shop to support the local economy .
negative	but , do not shop_here !!!
negative	i am not sure what type of scam they are running , but it is not a customer service friendly floral service !!
negative	they ended_up refunding my money , but , no flowers .
negative	i would not trust this shady business habits with anything that mattered .
negative	if they can '_t even follow through with a guaranteed delivery date , what else would they not be able to do ??!
negative	!
negative	i placed an order online a couple days ago .
negative	two hours_later i found out i only needed the wear sensors .
negative	so i tried_calling partsgeek , and not once did my call go through .
negative	i must of called 0 times .
negative	i even emailed customer service and still have not heard back from them .
negative	then guess what , a pad was chipped due to very poor packaging .
negative	they just tossed all 0 pads in a box , threw in a foam pad on top ( not in between each pad to avoid_damage ) and shipped it that way .
negative	and if i decide to return the product , i will get hit with a 00_% restocking_fee .
negative	i will never purchase sh_* t from this company ever again !!!!
negative	!
negative	i ordered a part to be delivered to my summer place .
negative	they emailed back , fine , no problem .
negative	then i got an_email_saying they wouldn_'_t send the part to an address other than the one on my credit_card ( my home address ), i emailed them back and said , ok , change the mailing_address but i needed the part within 0 days and call if there was a problem - giving them 0 phone numbers .
negative	they never called , just cancelled the order so i had to reorder , pay expedited mailing rates and the part i got didn_'_t even quite fit !
negative	the new_york attitude is alive and well at b_&_h .
negative	the feeling is pretty_much we don_'_t care if you buy or drop dead !
negative	good thing you have the best prices and assortment , otherwise i would '_t bother !
negative	!
negative	serious effort needs to be made to improve customer service and the folks who answer_questions .
negative	i had received an_email for free shipping when i signed_up with auto ship .
negative	i did just that and never received the free shipping .... they said there was a $_00 minimum for that email .... i read the email several_times ... no minimum was stated anywhere ... i fowarded the email ... and still did not get the free shipping as stated .
negative	told them to cancel the order but said oops too_late , already sent ... was not happy and wont shop again
negative	i don_'_t like when a company takes advantage of a product gettting discontinued and start gauging the prices like they do .
negative	terrible !
negative	beware , never got my order then got the run around trying to get my money back .
negative	excellent pricing , but out of stock with no apparent given time to obtain and ship .
negative	this eventually could be a 0_star if shipped within a week , or it could be a canceled order if longer .
negative	for $_00 shipping it said estimated wednesday 0 day delivery .
negative	so i cancel my amazon order for quick delivery .
negative	tuesday i get an_email that says your order has shipped .
negative	it is coming fedex_ground delivery will be 0 days on friday .
negative	i would have just went with amazon for ground_shipping .
negative	:(
negative	0 days for shipping is unacceptable when coming from california to ohio .
negative	i can drive there myself in 0 days .
negative	i created a support_ticket and was never contacted also .
negative	i will not be ordering from your company again .
negative	the only bright spot is that i actually got the right parts .
negative	this is the first time we '_ve ever done business with this company .
negative	we didn_'_t receive the product when we promised .
negative	it '_s been delayed twice according to the tracking_number .
negative	i called twice to ask our customer service rep chris hills to help us with the order and nothing has_been done so_far !
negative	as of this writing we still have no_idea when we '_ll receive the product .
negative	i have purchased a wowcher on 00th_december_0000 for a canvess photograph , to date , i am still_awaiting delivery .
negative	i have contacted the suppliers four times and received an_automated reply on each_occasion .
negative	i have contacted wowcher twice and received a reply that someone would get in touch with me .
negative	still no response .
negative	had a previous experience when i purchased a vax hoover , back in july_0000 , the vax cuts out .
negative	tried to get in touch with the suppliers and kept on getting a mail delivery knock back .
negative	will have to deal with vax direct to have it repaired or replaced under the warranty .
negative	lesson_learned don_'_t trust wowcher stay with established companies like moneysupermarket and groupon .
negative	jeg_har_købt_en_del tøj på_siden !
negative	men intet er nogen sinde kommet frem !
negative	efter lange mail samtaler og andet er_der intet sket !
negative	de påstår at min_pakke er kommet til danmark men kan intet andet fortælle
negative	spring siden over hvis i kan komme til_det det_er fusk !
negative	we have just cancelled the order meant to have been delivered last friday no sign of tables again yesterday surprise_surprise no show .
negative	customer service disgusting .
negative	will_definetely not be using homebase again be interesting to see how long it is before we get our money back
negative	i thought i was using another site to make reservation for a hotel_room .
negative	i soon as i hit enter on my room reservation and not getting any kind of response - i thought oh oh something is wrong .
negative	i tried to call them and none of their phone numbers would work ( for the ones you could find ).
negative	they took you in endless loops of not providing any information .
negative	i then called the hotel they were suppose to be making_reservations for me and found they had been full for over a week .
negative	i next called my credit_card company and found out they had already charged my account for $ 0 . 00 and i have no_idea why .
negative	so i cancelled my credit_card then and there so they could not charge me anything_else .
negative	please stay_away from them - they should be taken to court .
negative	well , i would love to write a great review judging from the photo '_s , but being that my delivery never even turned_up at all , its not a good start is it .
negative	so you already know what my feedback is going to be .
negative	the day was ruined and i was made to look a fool , as my girlfriend was expecting a surprise i said i got her , and then nothing showed_up .
negative	that is embarrassing .
negative	i feel disrespected .
negative	i specifically said it was important , so i was expecting everything to go perfectly , i was wrong .
negative	realistically i should demand another bunch of flowers on top of what i ordered , for all the embarrassment you caused .
negative	shaun
negative	what a joke you have no phone no what planit do you live on i got all the parts except the one i needed to start and no one to call screw email when im out in the garage fixing cars and you dope heads tell me to take a number and e_mail and you will get ahld of me well never and i need to tell the cust now well i told them there 000 bucks are who_knows so my customer says call them ha_ha_ha_ha no f ----- in number and the number to order parts no one ever answers and then you dick heads disconect you dont even say you dont i did it 0 times ive been a mec for 00yrs for vw and saab and you guys were the biggest joke i ever_seen o dont worry i told about 00 people about you and even more on putor way to run a bissiness no phone_number what are you tring to hide you know i though i found a new place to buy parts becouse i spend about $_00 . 000 a year but your not getting it no phone_number ha_ha_ha_ha_ha
negative	part shipped on time .
negative	quality part installed ok and worked ok . did not get any rma or core shipping instructions .
negative	sent e_-_mail requesting rma , got an e_-_mail with a number stating they ' d get around to it .
negative	more e_-_mails and it is obvious i '_m getting_ripped_off for core_charge .
negative	no phone_number to contact customer service either .
negative	i will never use again .
negative	bought an mp0 player from them as i had purchased dvd '_s without much problems in the past .
negative	mp0 player stopped_working after about a month so tried returning it to play . com .
negative	i went through the help process and couldnt see how to return the item so i wrote to customer_services .
negative	that was two_weeks_ago and still no response .
negative	ok i have lost the cost of the mp0 player but they have lost any further business from me and at every opportunity i will tell people how bad their customer service is .
negative	ignored subsequent emails to apply .
negative	jeg sad og kiggede lidt på_en_af de flotte scootere på billigscooter . dk , og forelskede mig jo næsten i en_af dem .
negative	flotte er de .
negative	men_så " begik jeg fejlen ", at tjekke forhandlerens trustpilot side .
negative	heldigvis for mig , for her er jo et_par ganske negative ratings , allerede .
negative	jeg_kontaktede så forhandleren for at høre hvad han havde at sige til sit forsvar , men_det kom der_ikke meget ud_af .
negative	jeg spurgte ham om ikke han havde lyst_til at besvare den kritik der nu findes her , af han forretning .
negative	men_det_var han sørme ikke interesseret i . han sendte mig følgende svar , og her citere jeg :
negative	" skal ikke være slave af trustpilot , det_er_en forretning og med tiden skal vi sikkert betale for kunne_få lov til at svare .. trustpilot er_ikke en forbrugerorganisation men en business ..
negative	hvis_du har nogle spørgsmål , kan du stillede dem her !"
negative	citat slut .
negative	på baggrund af ratings her på_trustpilot , og en ellers særdeles ukompetent kundeservice , holder jeg mig langt væk_fra billigscooter . dk .
negative	puha ... ved ikke helt hvor_jeg_skal begynde .
negative	men dagen startede udemærket , de var_der kl .
negative	0 . 00 som_var tidligere end aftalt , dette_er_det_eneste positive jeg_kan fortælle .
negative	dette_var_meget godt , så kunne vi da komme tidligt igang med at pakke ud i den_anden ende .
negative	dog viste det sig at være langt fra sandheden , alt herfra gik nogenlunde galt .
negative	ingen havde styr_på noget , flyttemændende vidste ikke hvad_de skulle i hvilken rækkefølge simpelthen fordi deres chef ikke_havde fortalte dem hvad_de skulle .
negative	vi skulle flytte fra indre kbh til grenaa .
negative	vi_havde vores ting kl .
negative	00 . 00 om natten i grenaa .
negative	de mødte op med_en flyttemand mindre_end aftalt og hele processen var horribel .
negative	dette_er bestemt_ikke en kritik af de to brave flyttemænd der udførte opgaven , men en stor røffel til firmaet bag .
negative	jeg_vil i mit liv aldrig anbefale stjerneflyt til nogen af mine bekendte .
negative	en rigtigt dårlig oplevelse .
negative	ydermere har vi skrevet præcist det samme som anmeldelse på " servicebyen . dk ", og_der_har ejeren meget u - høfligt besvaret at det_hele var vores skyld .
negative	ejeren springer uden om alle problemerne , med anklager om fejl fra vores side .
negative	selvom stjerneflyt er billige , er_det bestemt_ikke pengene værd :)
negative	det_er_helt_klart en_af de værste steder jeg nogensinde har handlet .
negative	jeg_bestilte_en final fantasy xiv coll ed , men modtog ikke på release dato .
negative	modtog den slet_ikke !
negative	der ud over besvare de slet_ikke support mails .
negative	kan_bestemt_ikke anbefale dem .
negative	godt nok er_deres priser lave , men_så hellere betale det mere , og rent faktisk få hvad_man bestiller :-)
negative	avoid !
negative	:-)
negative	i have been a costumer at santrex . net for over 0 years_now , and i have finally_decided to move to another company .
negative	i have been hosting company and fan sites , and have never experienced such terrible uptime and service .
negative	their servers are down so often , that it is really unusable .
negative	since i have been a costumer for so long , i really know about this stuff .
negative	i can only say .. avoid santrex at any costs .
negative	simply not worth a penny .
negative	web_page said there were 00 in stock and the notice we got said they were on back order .
negative	that is the reason we ordered it from them .
negative	now they can keep their part as they are not the only supplier .
negative	less_than 00_hours_later after making a purchases , a request to to change the printing on an_additional item was declined due to it had been shipped .
negative	still_waiting for the package to arrive .
negative	when you fork out the ' big bucks ', you deserve better customer service .
negative	travelocity still has never reached out to me in regards to our trip in hawaii .
negative	but they sure ask for reviews on how well they did , but what about how well they don_'_t do !
negative	i know that there are other ways to travel besides them and i suggest you do the same .
negative	ordered a replacement queen for a package of bees i got about 0_weeks_ago .
negative	it was dead when it arrived and i filed a claim with the post_office .
negative	the envelope it was sent in seemed inadequate to me .
negative	i understand backorder from a manufacturer , but after being told for two months the glasses were on backorder i finally just said screw it give me my money back .
negative	upon asking for it back , the date miraculously went to the day ok said i wanted my money and not 00 days like it was originally_quoted .
negative	too ironic for me .
negative	made me feel_like they were just toying with me and when i finally wanted my money back i got my s ***.
negative	parts_geek provides fast shipping but their customer service is one of the worst i have ever_experienced .
negative	i have been trying to return an item i purchased for over a week and i am getting nowhere .
negative	as i only have 00 days to return it , they will most_likely make it so that i will be unable to get my money back !
negative	not impressed with this company !!!
negative	!
negative	having dealt_with yodel on a number of occasions i never_fail to be surprised at their total incompetence .
negative	they have left notes saying they have called , even_though we have been sitting waiting .
negative	trying to contact the local_branch is extremely difficult .
negative	on 0 occasions i have driven up to 00 miles to the depots rather_than wait 0 years for delivery or have them return the item to sender because they are unable to meet their contract !
negative	my latest order placed on a friday arrived in the local depot at 00 : 00 on the monday and was tagged as being in transit at 00 : 00 on that day .
negative	my wife cancelled an_appointment to get home to receive the parcel which didn_'_t arrive .
negative	i took the tuesday off work to sit and wait for it , again it didn_'_t arrive .
negative	i contacted yodel who stated that it ' may ' be delivered on wednesday .
negative	this was extremely_helpful knowing that i ' could ' be forced to take a week off work waiting for the delivery company to decide when it wishes to complete the 00 mile trip ( closer this time ) to my house .
negative	i assume with government cutbacks they have resorted to deliver via india using a rickshaw .
negative	again , it will be cheaper for me to drive to the centre and pick it up myself ... if i could speak with someone at the centre , which i can '_t !
negative	my children are now unable to deliver a golden wedding present to their grandparents when they travel there tomorrow .
negative	next time , i shall take the bull by the horns and drive the 000_miles to sheffield , which will probably end up cheaper and far quicker !
negative	i ordered a pair of sunglasses from smart buy sunglasses a couple of months_ago and was told the shipping was free .
negative	this turned_out to be a complete lie when fedex sent me a bill for the shipping of the sunglasses .
negative	i contacted smart buy sunglasses and was told to pay the shipping to fedex and they would reimburse me .
negative	this turned_out to be just another lie on their end .
negative	i paid the shipping and e_- mailed smart buy glasses a copy of the receipt so i could get reimbursed as they promised .
negative	the only_thing i received was more frustration .
negative	i have now e_- mailed them that receipt no less_than three_times , with their only response being to email them a copy of the receipt that i have already sent .
negative	now , my latest e_-_mails are being ignored all together .
negative	their advertisement of free shipping is nothing more than a scam to get your attention and entice you to order from their site .
negative	if you order sunglasses from this site add at_least $_00 to what your total says because you will be receiving a bill for shipping and they will not reimburse you no matter what they tell you .
negative	i don_'_t mind you sending the wrong product , everyone makes mistakes .
negative	but charging me to send the wrong product back to you is totally wrong .
negative	i buy a product for $_00 . 00 with shipping and i have to pay $_00 . 00 to send it back two_weeks_later so i can get my $_00 . 00 back is wrong .
negative	you need to send the $_00 . 00 back to me .
negative	they shipped me someone_else '_s order .
negative	according to the laws set forth by the ftc , i am not responsible for goods i didn_'_t order and i am entitled to an immediate refund or replacement part .
negative	partsgeek instructed me that i would have to pay for return shipping .
negative	furthermore , they would not credit me until the part was received undamaged and then it would take about 00 days to credit my account .
negative	this is a direct violation of the law .
negative	do not order from partsgeek .
negative	there are many reputable parts dealers on the internet , such as autozone , napaonline , rockauto , and jcwhitney .
negative	don_'_t waste your time with partsgeek .
negative	it is an epic failure .
negative	ordered diablo_iii , as they said that they would deliver on 00th , got all ready to play the whole night , but they didn_'_t deliver .
negative	then they promised close to launch that they will try to deliver all the keys in 0 hours , still no key .
negative	then they said they will deliver the keys in 00_hours ...
negative	still no key .
negative	now it '_s almost midnight and i still don_'_t have my key .
negative	just dreadful .
negative	now that i actually attracted your attention here , can i have order #_00000 fulfilled , please ?
negative	thank_you .
negative	took very long to get it even i paid for express shipping i called them they where really not helpful
negative	i placed a simple repair order - to replace a small plastic piece that is part of the nose - bridge on my sunglasses .
negative	this was done on may 00 .
negative	this is a 00 cent part and maybe 0 minutes of work for which they charged me over $_00 and i had to pay for the shipping both_ways .
negative	this , and it took over to months to complete the work .......
negative	never again will i use them and i suggest no one else does either .
negative	please refund me .
negative	i have never had such poor online service !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
negative	please please please please refund me !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
negative	!
negative	took_forever to ship .
negative	ordered wrong part asked them to switch never go a response and sent me wrong part anyways !
negative	!
negative	i will never prefer this company to anyone .
negative	you took my money for some bad parts .
negative	never never never agin !
negative	!!!!!!!
negative	$$$#!

negative	i spend quite a few nights .
negative	and use .
negative	laquita a lot .
negative	i was riding in the car not driving and made what i thought was a reservation on laquita .
negative	web .
negative	site .
negative	as it turns_out .
negative	i was ripped_off with some ones web_site .
negative	yes .
negative	i am sure the name was somewhere on the screen .
negative	but it in .

negative	do a little digging and find the actual reviews written by actual people !
negative	i would bet my paycheck that 00_% of the positive_reviews are written by employees of ripoffair !
negative	i have traveled many_times and used lots of travel sites ... never have i felt inclined to post a glowing review upon returning home .
negative	only the negative ones are what i post and cheapoair has thousands and thousands of negative ones !
negative	i am_glad i saw them before i wasted my money on a flight that doesnt exist of costs 00_% more than advertised !
negative	it been more than eight days seen i recieved the wrong and broken part , i recieved claim numbers four difference time from customer service , but no respond from anyone , no one answer telephone_number .
negative	very poor service for this order , web_site for locating parts needed is good , customer service and recieving parts is very poor
negative	i am a customer since 0 years and have ordered 0 - 00 times before .
negative	now they have have decided to refuse my orders and 0 - 0 phone_calls to sales did not solve problem as they had no staff available .
negative	an_email that was answered 0 days_later said they would not send me anything ever .
negative	story goes , ordered pedals & bits ok no problem , less_than 00_hours_later wiggle change their prices of 0 items i ' d just bought meaning i was 00 quid out of pocket .
negative	wiggle point blank refused to honour their new prices .
negative	now i could have sent them back at no cost to me , got a refund and then ordered the same parts again at the new prices .
negative	this is what wiggle were expecting me to do .
negative	where is the sense in that for anyone involved ?
negative	why not save everyone the time and inconvenience and win a few brownie_points too ?
negative	the end_result would be the same and it would have cost them less .
negative	what i ended_up doing was finding them elsewhere and returning the order to wiggle , at their expense .
negative	they '_ve lost me as a customer which is a shame as i have spent plenty with them over the last 0 years .
negative	i thought i could trust this website but it appears i was wrong they sold me a nexon_game card for 00 bucks and as i went to use the game card on the game website it wasnt enough numbers i was missing 0 numbers and it said invalid pin !!!
negative	i wrote to them about this and they couldnt resolve my problem its ok i will never buy from pc_game_supply again !!
negative	!
negative	i ordered here cause the price was decent and they have an instant delivery system .
negative	even_though the site read in big caps that everything was in stock , nothing was in stock .
negative	i waited 00_hours for an xbox_live_gold code and finally got a refund .
negative	they say they will respond in anywhere between half an_hour and 00_hours , but i had to wait 00_hours and got a lame response .
negative	actually only got lame responses , not even an_apology .
negative	don_'_t order here , service sucks and the instant delivery system is a big fail !
negative	this was my second purchase here and my last !
negative	!
negative	i made the biggest mistake in my life booking my flight thru ' bravofly .
negative	your website did not allow me to do the following during the booking stage :
negative	choose my seats , long legs !
negative	( prepared to pay for it )
negative	book my meals
negative	auto check in .
negative	i remember paying for extra baggage to 00 kg , but this was not reflected in my itinerary .
negative	i sent you an_email but it was not answered until very close to my departure .
negative	i will never use bravofly in future and i '_m telling all my friends about your incompetence .
negative	i asked you to stop emailing me and you will not stop pestering me .
negative	please stop !
negative	black is coming off already and its only been on the truck 0_weeks
negative	ordered brake_pads on 0 / 00 / 00 .
negative	00 days_later and still_waiting to receive them .
negative	sorry to say i will not be ordering anything from parts_geek in the future !!
negative	really guys almost two_weeks for brake_pads .
negative	the review is in a separate e_-_mail
negative	i bought a part that said it was an oe replacement and the holes did not line up .
negative	they weren_'_t even close to the holes on the car
negative	i ordered a part on 00 / 0 / 0000 .
negative	your web_site said the part was in stock .
negative	the monies was with drawn from my bank_account and paid to you on 00 / 0 / 0000 .
negative	here it is the 00th and the part has yet to be shipped .
negative	i have made 0 inquiries has to why the part has not shipped .
negative	you respond as if you are going to look into the matter but you don_'_t .
negative	i booked a one night_stay at a hotel with you guys .
negative	my husband decided we needed to stay an extra night .
negative	so i got online and ended_up getting the same hotel on a friday_night for $_00 cheaper .
negative	i will never use your sight again !
negative	booked one car but after a week i didnt get any confirmation_email so i rebooked .
negative	then i got 0 texts with both booking confirmations .
negative	so rather_than call the 00p_per min phoneline i sent an_email .
negative	after 0 emails back and forth they still have not cancelled my booking and guided_me to call their 00p_per min phoneline to cancel .
negative	don_'_t go to drive time .
negative	they don_'_t care about you they are trying to just sell junk cars then expect you to pay for repairs yourself .
negative	i think i '_m calling news 0 so they can '_t do any one else like me .
negative	i will expose the truth .
negative	my name is cesar morales i placed an order for a 0000_bmw 000ci oxygen_sensor and you people send me a volks wagen sensor .
negative	i have been trying to get in touch with you guys .
negative	but you dont seem to answer or return any of my calls .
negative	if you people really read this you will return my phone_calls or email .
negative	my cell ( 000 ) 0000000 .
negative	my email cesar_c . y . j @_hotmail . com my order number is 00 -_00000000 .
negative	i purchased an a transmission_cooler for my 0000_dodge_ram_0000 diesel pickup_truck .
negative	upon_receipt of the part .
negative	i discovered that it was the wrong part .
negative	the box it was shipped in had the correct part number for what i ordered .
negative	inside was a transmission_cooler for a 0 . 0l dodge_truck .
negative	i immediately went to partsgeek website to find a phone_number to report i had a problem .
negative	there was none .
negative	so i emailed partsgeek to inform them that i received the wrong part .
negative	in the email , i asked for representative to call me to resolve the situation as soon as possible .
negative	every email i received appeared to be an_automated email .
negative	i stressed in my reply emails that i needed to have the issue resolved quickly .
negative	i stated that the part was for my work vehicle that i use everyday to earn my income .
negative	i never received a phone_call .
negative	just a bunch of automated emails .
negative	it was very frustrating .
negative	a simple 0 minute phone_call to return the wrong part received and ship the correct one could have satisfied my needs .
negative	i shipped the wrong part back to partsgeek .
negative	instead of shipping the correct part they refunded the money and did not pay for the return shipping cost .
negative	in my closing statement .
negative	i will never use partsgeek again !!!
negative	and i will not refer anybody to use partsgeek
negative	orderd a shower screen , on the photo in the newspaper advert it shows a shower basin but when you order it was delivered with no shower basin ...... one word con springs to mind .
negative	i sent a email to ask why and did not reply ( so company is rubbish ) to the person reading this i will say you will not publish this reply ..
negative	erni pendlebury
negative	purchased ( 0 ) round_trip airfare and rent a car , purchased package as a guest and created an account after .
negative	i still can '_t log_into my itinerary after several_attempts , and over 00_hours on the phone my problem still is not resolved .
negative	last time i use travelocity .
negative	i '_ve probably spent over $ 0 , 000 on their website , never had problems , and then they sent me 0 invalid codes .
negative	i couldn_'_t get them to fix it , and then before i could ask to just refund they locked my account .
negative	response :
negative	this is just not true .
negative	you asked me contact jagex , which i said i wouldn_'_t do for each and every on e of the 0 cards .
negative	even after this , i purchased another 00 cards which worked_fine until they disabled my account with remaining cards left on the order .
negative	not only did the con me out of 0 of the cards on one order , the conned me out of 0 / 00 on another order !
negative	the credibility of the comment is just thrown out the window when it says " the support staff he got immediate_response ", as it literally took a few hours .
negative	also , " the jack '_s account was disabled " speaks for itself .
negative	i just filed chargebacks with my bank for the $_000 i spent on the website , and i '_ll be receiving my funds back at any time now .
negative	it '_s really quite shocking that they ' d even try this seeing as getting my money back took a simple phone_call , and instead of replacing 0 cards for a grand total of ~$ 00 , they chose to loose out of $_000 .
negative	have a great day :)
negative	the service was terrible .
negative	u will not order from here again .
negative	got my parts they were damaged .
negative	can '_t get_ahold of customer_support .
negative	the filters are cheap flimsy imitations .
negative	they are to manufactured to specifications and do not even fit in the unit .
negative	the company will not return my call or email .
negative	doesn_'_t get any worse !
negative	was sold a 0_star motel while on assignment on a news story .
negative	this place was a pit , according to colleges on the scene .
negative	when i reported this to the agent , while still online booking my reservation , he hung_up on me .
negative	i called back and cancelling the booking was followed by no less_than 00_minutes of " on - hold " bs .
negative	these_guys are snakes out after your money !
negative	do not book with this site !
negative	eventually reached resolution ...... i hope .
negative	i booked to get 0 front tyres on my daughters car and 0 rear tyres on my car changed online .
negative	i was able to select a day and time and after having received confirmation of the order - via_email - as the web_page was unable to display the final confirmation - i thought that was it !
negative	wrong !
negative	i got a missed call on my mobile and the message said call this 00 whatever number ... but my phone said another number - i trusted the phone and got a message_saying call the other number ...
negative	by now i ' d got the confirmation_email - 0 with a tel number to call , so i called it and the chap there said sorry he couldn_'_t help me ( nor transfer me to the right department ).
negative	i recovered the message and dialled the number ( the last digit was 0 digit away from the number i ' d previously dialled ) they couldn_'_t get hold of my details and said they ' d have to call me back ....
negative	i then get a call saying that they can '_t do the time and day i wanted - hang on i say , your website has confirmed this already - the reply was basically that it shouldn_'_t display this option as the systems weren_'_t linked .
negative	so i said ok cancel the order - apparently it would take 0 days to get the money back - i said if that was the case i wanted compensation - or my money back today .
negative	he goes off to check and finally i get a call saying they ' re bringing someone in from another region to fit my tyres on the day and time i ' d been originally confirmed .
negative	tyres were fitted fine - as_promised .
negative	that part of the service was excellent .
negative	the part getting to that was shocking !
negative	would i use kwik_fit again - well they ' d have to be really really cheap to make me use them again after that experience
negative	i bought a $_00 itunes_gift_card and i received just $_00 …
negative	apparently baracuta provide free returns .
negative	when i went to return my products with the address_label they provided , the post_office said i had to pay for it .
negative	i don_'_t know if this was the incorrect label or what but one way or another i had to pay for it .
negative	i emailed baracuta over a week_ago about this ( ref : 0000000 ) and have received no reply .
negative	i understand that things can go_wrong , it '_s how companies react that matters .
negative	the fact that they haven_'_t even replied is downright rude .
negative	i wouldn_'_t recommend them to anyone .
negative	baracuta , if you are reading this , can you please reply to my email .
negative	thank_you .
negative	i ordered for next_day delivery and ( not for the first time ) the delivery wasn_'_t made .
negative	i ordered on sunday_evening expecting it on tuesday and when i rang the delivery company ( yodel ) tuesday_afternoon they said that they only received the package from myprotein at 0 :_00am on tuesday !
negative	as a result , myprotein had missed the yodel cut_off for tuesday delivery .
negative	and i had placed my delivery on sunday !
negative	did myprotein check to see if they had missed their delivery ?
negative	no , of course not .
negative	so i contacted myprotein with the complaint on tuesday ( mhn - 000000 ).
negative	did i hear back from them ( 0 days_later now )?
negative	no , of course not , because they '_ve got their money .
negative	i had to ring yodel and reorganise delivery again .
negative	i would not recommend this company .
negative	they can '_t control their deliveries , which is one thing .
negative	but the really bad thing is that they don_'_t reply to complaints .
negative	i judge a company more by how they rectify mistakes than the mistakes they make .
negative	myprotein are terrible on both_counts .
negative	my wife and i flew from sevilla to copenhagen ( via barcelona ) on the 00 . 00 . 0000 .
negative	we were charged an extra € 00 for our suitcases in check - in , even when we have already paid for them in our booking on the website .
negative	we were told that the € 00 that we paid for 0 suitcases was only for baggage handling from sevilla to barcelona only , hence we had to pay from barcelona to copenhagen .
negative	when we bought the tickets we understood that it '_s for the entire journey as the website never indicated that there will be an extra_charge from barcelona to copenhagen .
negative	we were told that we could make a claim if we disagreed when we get home .
negative	we wrote to vueling and they refused to give us a refund on the ground that they were in the right to charge us .
negative	firstly , they should indicate clearly what people are paying for when ordering tickets on their website .
negative	secondly , they should not charge passengers double for their baggage .
negative	(€ 00 on the web and € 00 in check - in ) when it is their own fault .
negative	thirdly , they should refund the passengers who were charged extra for baggage handling .
negative	it '_s not the fault of the passengers as they have acted in good faith .
negative	we will never fly vueling again as we feel_cheated by the company .
negative	i placed my order on thursday .
negative	web_site zip_code database was about 0 years out of date and would not accept correct zip_code and i so indicated in the comments section .
negative	web_site indicated orders would ship on saturday .
negative	order processed on sunday according to my bank_statement .
negative	received email on monday indicating ordered shipped on saturday as planned .
negative	ups received order on wednesday with old zip_code .
negative	ups sent order back to mcm at mcm '_s request .
negative	ordered received on loading dock on thursday per ups_tracking .
negative	sent email_requesting status and never received a reply .
negative	cancelled order on friday .
negative	placed order with another company on friday .
negative	a check with mcm support indicates returned ordered logged_into warehouse on monday .
negative	received second order on tuesday .
negative	received refund on wednesday .
negative	other than this , the process was flawless .
negative	feel_ripped_off !
negative	actual rate and total paid were more than actual rate at hotel !
negative	here '_s my first remarks on this company .
negative	i bought a flight with this company , paid € 0000 for it with cancellation protection , had to cancel and dispite numerous efforts to seek a refund have got no satisfaction from them .
negative	i would be very careful in giving them any money !.
negative	here '_s their response .
negative	dear mr mcgrath ,
negative	you have a travelwaiver gold protection and you can cancel for whatever_reason .
negative	you will receive a max .
negative	refund of $ 0000 less a $_000 deductible .
negative	we pay you back the amount as soon your request is processed and we received travelwaivers authorization which may take between 0 - 0week .
negative	kind_regards
negative	eveline
negative	cstomer support
negative	well if that is the case why am i still_waiting for a response from your company , it is 0 days since i posted my comments and you have not responded to 0 further emails , nor to the previous 0 emails seeking information .
negative	it is 0_weeks since i cancelled my flight , and yes i know i could do so since i paid 000 $ for a cancellation protection , the point is you have not communicated with me , despite numerous_emails , not that i have gold protection .
negative	it is 0_weeks since i canceled , you claim it takes 0 to 0_weeks to secure a refund and your only communication is to attempt a pr exercise to justify your behaviour and attempt to mislead future customers .
negative	get in touch with me if you are a reputable_company !!
negative	!.
negative	for the two first weeks it was all about trying to get an account set_up for the final week finally got the equipment but can actually get it hooked up on the self install and whenever i ask them to have someone send out they had them sent out and never came had to go to work and came 00_minutes after he was supposed to be here some never got it hooked up properly bad service all the way around no compensation nothing at & t is the worst company to go through
negative	didnt get the car i booked , charged me for insurance i didnt want , broken things on the car ...
negative	will not hire from this company or recommend them .
negative	i am unhappy with pc_game_supply due to it '_s lack of customer_support and also because i have purchased ukash vouchers that i am unable to spend .
negative	i have attempted several_times to get a refund or a new voucher_code but never have and wasted $_00 .
negative	was terribly slow , so stopped using it long time ago , changed email address and forgot to update , billed automatically , which is unusual for a hosting company if you do not have the same visa_card anymore .
negative	would not use them again .
negative	diy letters is a complete rip - off .
negative	their webpage requests a ' letter size ' when actually it is the total size of all letters , top to bottom .
negative	when you order a multiple line set of letters , if you use 0 lines , your letters are half the size you intended .
negative	i ordered a three line sign for my truck and got 0 / 0 " letters instead of 0 " letters .... and 0 / 0 " letters instead of 0 " letters for a two line sign .
negative	when i called to complain the owner said ' yes , that happens sometimes '.
negative	i expect it happens nearly all the time , but he makes too much money cheating people .... his offer ... he '_ll credit what you paid against your next order for the correct size .
negative	no thanks , i dealt_with a crook once , i '_ll not do it twice .
negative	your customer service reps intentionally disconnect calls .
negative	they are inept , and the waiting / hold times are unacceptable .
negative	won_'_t be using your service again , will warn others .
negative	not a quick service .
negative	one number to phone which was annoyingly engaged most of the time and then had to stand around waiting for drop_off and pick_up .
negative	wouldn_'_t recommend it or use it again .
negative	placed order for a vacuum and vacuum bags .
negative	vacuum was delivered with a note_saying " bags to follow ".
negative	since then i have heard_nothing ( several weeks ).
negative	have emailed four times and never got a response apart_from once ( most recently ) saying " they are awaiting stock ".
negative	shame because the product and the price was excellent , just the poor customer service has_been a real let - down .
negative	this has_been a horrible experience .
negative	they ( partsgeek ) have no phone_number for you to reach them .
negative	the only communication is sketchy at best and you have to open up a trouble call to communicate with them .
negative	that is no way to conduct_business .
negative	then , if they have not answered your trouble call , they will not let you try to write them again because you can only have one open trouble call .
negative	i even gave them my phone_number for somebody to call me but still nothing .
negative	as far as i know , it could be a little old man just taking money .
negative	i have tried to prevent them from sending , i have challenged the payment through my credit_card and will not pay .
negative	i believe this to be a fraudulent company .
negative	i order a part from partsqeek and as soon as i was ready to order this part an unrelated items appear on the screen about free shipped and join this or that and i was unable to get out this ad so i had close the program and re - order .
negative	and as a result of partsqeek trying to make a little extra money i am stuck with a double order and out about $_00 . 00 .
negative	why can '_t they just let you order the part ?
negative	i tried and minute later to cancel the order and the email said you should have read the fine_print about canceling an order .
negative	i '_ll never order another part from this company and i '_m tell all my automotive friends the same thing .
negative	also , try calling their telephone_number they put you on hold for about five_minutes and then tell you to call later , but its the same results no matter what time you call .
negative	i '_m thinking about reporting them to the new_jersey better business_bureau .
negative	i ordered parts .
negative	they never shipped .
negative	still_waiting for over a week for an explanation .
negative	i booked my car through auto_europe for pickup in the geneva_airport .
negative	the price that i was quoted was competitive and so i went_ahead with the booking .
negative	when i got to the airport i was informed that there would be an_additional mandatory fee of about $_00 for winter_tires .
negative	this additional_charge rendered the rental fee less_than competitive .
negative	i told them that i did not want to pay and so they refused to rent me the car .
negative	of course this left me with only one option and that was to accept their scam and pay the fee .
negative	they should have notified me of this extra fee up front .
negative	the car itself was fine , and delivered as expected .
negative	booked united flight to barcelona .
negative	checked after one day and was told the order did not go through .
negative	you have 00_hours to cancel with united air .
negative	so , i checked the next_day and still it was listed as pending .
negative	called the next_day and they said it went through and if i was to cancel i would have to pay 000_dollars to now cancel .
negative	well after the first day i went directly to united website and booked .
negative	now i had 0 tickets on the same plane .
negative	luckily , i have a united credit_card and they took_care of it for me .
negative	but it was a hassle .
negative	so , the moral of the story is always write down the time , date , and person '_s name who you talk with on the phone in case something_goes_wrong .
negative	told my tyres where due in the next two_days i got confimation through booked a day of work and was told a day later that they would not be arriving at the gargage on the day promised .
negative	do not use very poor !!"
negative	ordered an oil_pan for my truck , and was shipped a completely wrong oil_pan .
negative	item and part numbers weren_'_t even close to matching .
negative	i then had to pay for re shipping , insurance and a re - stocking_fee .
negative	their incompetence has_been very expensive for me and has wasted weeks of my time .
negative	no customer service hotline number to help either .
negative	shopping with them is a gamble with time and money .
negative	close to the parties must immediately send , this prevents that the confusion of postal !!
negative	today 00th still not !!
negative	any way merry cristmas and happy new year davide
negative	i got the part i ordered , but within a week of placing my order on this website my card info was stolen and someone tried to buy afor $ 0000 plane_ticket to japan with it !
negative	i ordered diablo_0 more than a week in advance and was promised it before / on release_date , that did not happen at all , despite numerous reassurances from cjs telling customers that all keys would be sent on the 00th , me and hundreds more were left out in the cold , which ruined the planned game - night with me and my friends .
negative	they make promises that they do not fulfill and do not provide the necessary service telling customers what is going on and why their claims are not happening .
negative	my advice for you is to avoid this company .
negative	part was shipped late and received late .
negative	very slow responding customer service refused a return of unopened merchandise that arrived late .
negative	confusing web_site .
negative	never again .
negative	be warned .
negative	book was supposed to arrive with in 0 - 00 business days .
negative	i '_m still_waiting after 00 business days .
negative	they made me sit on hold for ever .
negative	then transferred me back and forth .
negative	had problems with getting info due to a vp of sales starting the process looking for names and then when i moved it over to me and i paid for it he still get '_s info .
negative	all you want to do is send a email and if someone doesn_'_t answer email you should call
negative	but you think email '_s does it all
negative	i will never use you again
negative	rebtel calling system very good but support department coming for time pass . my account is locked because i call on this no 0000000000000 and support department want why i call on this no and i tell them . but no respond my account is locked before ten days . not good very bad
negative	i would never deal with this company .
negative	they are a fraud .
negative	customers service , what customer service ?
negative	i received parts that were the wrong ones for my vehicle .
negative	the part numbers did not even match on the invoice and shipping order .
negative	i have tried_contacting them several_times by filling_out there stupid on line trouble ticket .
negative	i was told that i can only fill_out one .
negative	i did fill it out , but have never_heard from them .
negative	you can '_t call these_people on the phone , they have no listed phone_number to call .
negative	what a rip_off .
negative	do not !
negative	deal with this company .
negative	i sit here with useless parts , and a lighter wallet .
negative	poor support system .
negative	doesn_'_t respond to e_-_mails .
negative	still_waiting for keys .
negative	would not buy from again .
negative	i only bought on the assumption it was instant keys after paying .
negative	order 0st part for 0000 vega ( ball_joint ).
negative	partsgeek said part would fit 0000 thru 0000 vega - did not !
negative	found another part from partsgeek strictly for 0000 vega ( ball_joint ).
negative	both items had different part numbers , fiqured 0nd one would be correct one .
negative	it didn_'_t fit either and guess what , it had the same part number on the box as the first one .
negative	tried to call partsgeek twice , but was put on hold 00minutes ( 0st time ) and 00minutes ( 0nd time ).
negative	gave up .
negative	found correct parts from rare parts in california .
negative	guess if you want the right part , order it from somebody who_knows .
negative	will not order from paretsageek again ( as if they care ).
negative	i ordered a drivers_side_view_mirror for a 0000_toyota_corolla and received a passengers side_view for a completely different vehicle .
negative	in addition , i was not able to call for replacement or get the online trouble ticket system to work .
negative	all in all a very bad_experience .
negative	i would never use this service again .
negative	listen to how ridiculous this is :
negative	i '_m told to sign_up as a new client i will get the first 0 calls comp ' d ( no charge ).
negative	after 0 - 0 months i have to spend quite a bit of time on the phone with my account_manager going over calls that are actually invalid , that were considered " valid ".
negative	then , my second " valid " call my cc gets charged .
negative	instead of refunding me the call charge bc the agreeement was for the first 0 free , they say the next one will be free , so it evens_out in the end .
negative	and that was after i already told them i didn_'_t want the service anymore .
negative	then they said they don_'_t have the ability to process a refund ( blatant lie of any business ).
negative	so be warned .
negative	if you ' re ok with dealing_with a lot of headache , and a company not keeping their agreement , then give them a try .
negative	this company has one of the worst in us customer_support .
negative	rude , unfriendly , not even trying to help you in any way .
negative	once you put an order , they spit in you face .
negative	i am going to mastercard and my bank to file a complaint against you regarding my return / refund unless i hear from you and my refund is processed immediately .
negative	you have jerked me around long enough with your emails with no ability to contact you by telephone .
negative	i will further report you to the better business_bureau and any other business and internet regulatory institution that i can .
negative	your business activities and policies are obviously not under control when you refuse to take responsibility for damaged goods that are delivered to your customers .
negative	further , it appears you cannot effectively process a return even when all your requirements for return are met by the customer .
negative	best be calling me and processing my refund immediately .

negative	i ordered the alternator matched with my truck year make and model late in the afternoon , and was almost shocked when the ups driver delivered it the next_day .
negative	" how cool is that ", i thought to myself , unfortunately the electric connection did not fit my truck so i had to do an_rma ... at my own_expense i might_add .
negative	your company provides inaccurate information and lists the part as a fit for my make and model and i have to pay for the mistake ?
negative	you should know better ...
negative	the second one i ordered does come with the correct electrical connection but does not fit with the stock alternator brace .
negative	go figure ...
negative	i should know better i suppose for ordering from you again .
negative	combine these issues with unpredictable delivery ( took a week and a half to receive the second one eventhough it came from a few hours away ) and that '_s why next time i order parts online , it will be through amazon ... not partsgeek , sorry .
negative	in the immortal words of willy wonka , " you get nothing .
negative	you lose !"
negative	guessing it will also take a month to refund me the money from my rma too .
negative	poor form geeks !
negative	i cannot_believe the incompetence behind rejsekortet ... in which century do the management live in , in order to not make rejsekortet work smoothly ?
negative	rejsekortet could have been such a positive thing , but it is simply too little , too_late .... way too_late , sigh ,....
negative	customer_support was horrible .
negative	i received the wrong part twice .
negative	couldn_'_t reach them by phone .
negative	went to return my parts and shipping cost me twenty_dollars and if i get a refund there is also a restocking_charge .
negative	still_waiting to see what this mistake will finally cost me , without even getting a product at all .
negative	don_'_t buy you , it will cost you in the long run .
negative	purchased a $_00 psn_card .
negative	immediately i enter the issued card number in the ps0 .
negative	guess what ?!?!
negative	ps 0 says card code has already been used , not valid ...
negative	contacted of game_supply , they verified that the code was an original and i was the only one to receive that code .
negative	so , guess i get screwed out of 00 bucks ?!?!
negative	fuming pissed !!
negative	scam
negative	the shipping of this headlight unit was shipped ups then dropped_off at the post_office , who says it was delivered which i never received .
negative	i don_'_t understand_why parts_geek does this .
negative	i live 0 blocks from the post_office i would of had my part by now .
negative	i do not get my mail at my house and parts_geek did not put my po_box number on the package .
negative	the postoffice says that i picked_up the package on friday the 00th of may that was when i inquired_about it , and they could not find it .
negative	not gonna waste my time if partsgeek wants to know they can call me
negative	placed order via website for one of the panel packs & posts , added a half panel .
negative	the main_reason for the order was free delivery and specified delivery date .
negative	delivery date arrived ...... nothing .
negative	the monday arrives , only 0 panel out the 0 and all the posts /
negative	driver has no history of order .
negative	email sent to customer_services , still no reply .
negative	call made to customer_services and no reason was given for screw up .
negative	replacement panels ordered and given no delivery date .
negative	0 days_later , panels arrive .
negative	the upshot was i had to pay to get fence fitted as i was not home to do the fitting myself , hence_why the delivery date was so important .
negative	got recommended from family_member , i will not be doing the same .
negative	i could have placed order locally , been charged for delivery and fitted it myself and still have have cash left .
negative	now out of pocket and no reason given .
negative	ordered multiple parts from partsgeek ( front_struts and an o0_sensor ) and spent all day installing the struts and paid to have my car towed to the nearest shop to get an alignment just to find out one of the struts was defective .
negative	so of course my car is not drivable and of course partsgeek does not have a phone_number to process a return so i had to wait a day to hear back from then about getting another strut .
negative	then after hassling them to call me i finally get a phone_call and the guy is totally rude and tells_me i have to pay the shipping to send it back !?
negative	this is 0000 ..
negative	i had to order another strut on top of paying for another spring compressor rental and take my car apart again and then pay 00 $ to ship the original strut back !
negative	this is a horrible business model and they deserve to fail .
negative	buyer_beware ....
negative	my order was not fully processed and i completed a help ticket .
negative	no one has contacted me to even try to correct it either .
negative	i have made parts orders since but didn_'_t even consider_using them again .
negative	disappointed
negative	having said it was great after payment went through and i was asked to make a review , i will have to totally withdraw that .
negative	absolutely useless waste of space of a company .
negative	valentines only come once a yr like christmas .
negative	imagine christmas day with no toys for your children .
negative	well that '_s what its like today no flowers , explain to you wife where her flowers are !!!!!!!!!!!

negative	i cancelled my order when my 0 year_old prescription was not accepted .
negative	you don_'_t need a prescription to get novelty colored contact_lenses with no corrective power , so why do you need one for corrective lenses ?
negative	the prescriptions only last a year , but vision insurance only covers one exam a year .
negative	that means that if you have glasses and contacts , you ' re only covered for one or the other .
negative	this practice is designed to make more money for optometrists and it ends up hurting businesses like yours .
negative	you ' re requiring a prescription from the last_year , but there are plenty of canadian sites offering the same lenses for similar prices with no required prescription .
negative	you ' re losing my business thanks to the fairness to contact_lens consumer act ( 0000 ).
negative	part was broken in two places , have been calling to get replacement . no answer .
negative	i order flowers for my girlfriend for valentines_day , how do i look when they never show up .
negative	i call last night to see what is up since they have 00 / 0 customer service well apparently thats a lie because when i called there customer service is only open from 0am - 0pm .
negative	i sent an_email , i have yet to hear_anything back .
negative	i have called at_least ten times this morning and have either been hung_up on , or the call cuts off .
negative	this is a disgrace of a business .
negative	never use teleflora !
negative	!
negative	the controllers i ordered had sticky buttons and they didn_'_t send me instructions on how to set_up the controller .
negative	i had to fix them myself , overall they had good service and friendly , nice people to talk to .
negative	this was a costly experience .
negative	when initially booking the round_trip flight , i mistakenly booked the wrong outbound_flight .
negative	after looking into the " terms and conditions " i determined that there would be no refunds and no opportunity to change the reservation .
negative	so i booked the correct outbound_flight as a one - way , expecting to use the existing return flight that i had already booked .
negative	upon_arriving at the airport for the return trip , i was told that travelocity had canceled my entire trip because i did not use the outbound_flight .
negative	this incredibly frustrating .
negative	i was never notified by travelocity that this would happen , or that it did happen .
negative	i ended_up buyiing a one - way return flight at the gate , which was about 0x the price of the flight as originally booked through travelocity .
negative	it would seem reasonable that if travelocity were going to cancel my flight / order they should at_least let_me know they had done so .
negative	terrible experience
negative	trying to return part to exchange for the correct part that i can use .
negative	will not answer phone .
negative	no way to correspond with company .
negative	would not recommend this company to anyone unless i hear back .
negative	i ordered past for a 0000 crew cab gmc searria
negative	and recevied parts for a 0oo0 ext cab
negative	and they expect me to pay for the return
negative	online order information was neither timely nor accurate .
negative	tracking_information provided was not accurate .
negative	there '_s no customer service telephone_number ?
negative	email responses to customer service questions are slow and not helpful .
negative	very frustrated , will not purchase from again .
negative	i received the wrong_size air_filters .
negative	i sent email to notify .
negative	i was told to take pictures of label inside box .
negative	i followed instructions but never have received the order i paid for .
negative	i will never order again from this company .
negative	food was finally delivered after 0 . 0 hours , take away blamed takeaway . com saying they only got the fax 0 . 0 hours_later grrrr
negative	i started_using rebtel around march_0000 , and gave it a try because of their pricing .
negative	it worked out okay until they could not trace my funds wired from paypal into my account .
negative	their customer service did a horrible job by deploying delay tactics from friday 00th 0000 and as i write this review , they are yet to credit $_00 . 00 back into my account to reflect the funds as being available in the account .
negative	the most annoying part is the scam like emails which they keep sending when your email them . such as " our support is currently unavailable " or email us back in 0 days as we are adding new tools and improving our routines to offer a better support !
negative	all together i have sent approximately 00 emails , in which i get such responses about how their " engineers " are working round the clock .
negative	my $_00 . 00 is yet to be posted to my account .
negative	what a scam of a company !!!!
negative	by the way i will not advise anyone to use their credit_card on their website ..
negative	ordered a windshield_washer_fluid reservoir for a 00 dodge 0 / 0 ton 0x0 v00 - i received a lower engine_cover for an 00 - 00 prius .
negative	what an insult .
negative	after_contacting customer service through email - i find out - even_though it is their shipping error - as a " customer " i '_m responsible for the return shipping and the correct part has not been shipped .
negative	it will be the last time i use parts_geek - my advice is - go some place else .
negative	don_'_t waste the time or effort .
negative	then they '_ll send a request to rate your experience - for a $_00 coupon that i find out later is only good on orders over $_000 .
negative	thumbs down in oregon .
negative	robert fordice hermiston , oregon
negative	i ordered a set of headlight_assemblies , i selected the correct year and make and model , they sent the wrong part , i hope they will make it right , but i emailed them 0 days ago and today finally got a response asking what part number and what car i drive , it is the part i ordered and the car is attached to the description if the part , so i replied with the info and now i '_m waiting again ...
negative	they have no phone_number and have not called me , very annoyed ....
negative	i received the product without a product manual ........ or guide ..... and its very difficult to configure the internet since there is no internet icon on the apps ..... toooo bad
negative	i '_m really surprised travelocity is selling this hotel .
negative	it is not up to the par .
negative	very run down rooms , 0000 '_s floral bed comforter with a hole in the middle , chipped furniture , very old tv worked only for the first 0 minutes then just died , broken security latch at the door , dirty bathroom etc .
negative	feels very out - dated and unsecured .
negative	we booked a room with an ocean_view , but of course we did not get it .
negative	while asking the front_desk agent about the ocean_view room , he rudely replied that we should complain to our travel_agency , because he is not going to give us a different room .
negative	the beach was not nice either .
negative	we left after 00_minutes and booked a room in a different hotel , we ended_up losing money but there was no way we could spend our vacations in such a place .
negative	when i receive my order i can give a review .
negative	0 / 00 / 0000
negative	bought a £_000 freestanding duel fuel cooker suk00 in black .
negative	delivered fine by appliancesonline .
negative	when fitted , found the grill does not work .
negative	tried to book an engineers visit to be told they don_'_t do out of hours or weekend call outs .
negative	told them i would be returning it if they didn_'_t sort it at my convenience , was basically told , " go_ahead ".
negative	trying to return it now .
negative	the grill doesn_'_t work .
negative	smeg will not do an out of hours or weekend call out .
negative	returning it .
negative	will warn all ( god willing ) next to be parents to think_twice before placing orders through this site , personal and next door neighbour '_s experiences .
negative	our order was placed on 00th of jan , after finilizing purchase we rang straight to confirm delivery estimate , and we were promised within 00 days but not 00 as stated on their website .
negative	today is day 0o and no comms from the retailer , you ring their number ( 00000000000 ) it rings non_- stop and sometimes after couple rings you can easily feel someone has just cancelled your call and you get told by the automated vm your respondent can '_t be reach ...
negative	this almost_half a grand of your hard_earned money spent folks the least you will expect from a decent * company is to have someone picking_up the bloody phone and give you head up about your order .
negative	we have decided to cancel this order no matter what , they don_'_t deserve this money and they can go f off with their bed .
negative	will d . e . f . i . n . i . t . e . l . y not be recommending .
negative	product shipped to wrong_address and needed to be rerouted
negative	product arrived with the wrong connectors - incompatible with us plumbing
negative	0 phone_calls later ( 0_weeks ) they discover they shipped the wrong connectors and promise to send the correct parts
negative	0 phone_calls later ( 0_weeks ) they send replacement parts
negative	replacement parts arrive and are still wrong - i request a product return
negative	0 calls ( over 0 months ) to various support people later , i eventually reach a manager who arranged a ups pickup of the product
negative	0 calls later ( another month goes by ) i am told that the products never arrived back in their warehouse and thats_why i haven_'_t gotten a refund
negative	my call today - i '_m told that the products did actually arrive in their warehouse , but the refund process failed .
negative	i '_m promised refund and an_email back tomorrow to confirm it '_s done .
negative	i doubt i '_ll get an_email or a call back because during every_single interaction i '_ve been promised a follow - up from hudson_reed employees and i have never ( not one single time ) ever received that call or email back .
negative	i wait still hoping for a refund that i am now fairly sure will never arrive .
negative	this is the worst company i have ever_dealt_with in my life ( this is the first product review i '_ve ever written in my life ) - i feel so passionately screwed over by these_people that i '_ll make it my passion to tell the world !
negative	never got a reservation cancelation email confirm called two times
negative	been with frooition for about 0 years_now .
negative	back then they were good .
negative	you could talk to the designer via_email , customer service via_email etc etc .
negative	now when you have a problem its virtually_impossible to get anything sorted_out .
negative	the prices are getting ridiculous for what they do .
negative	the design is ok ( template based with limited personalisation ) and delivery of the show / website was fairly prompt .
negative	however the recent changes to customer service in my opinion are the start of the demise of frooition unless they get their act_together .
negative	in todays_world of it companies fighting for your business customers need full and fast support for website problems , its their living frootion !!
negative	take_note of that !!!
negative	no website working .... no income !
negative	!
negative	for now i ' d totally recommend you go elsewhere and avoid frooition at all costs until they make customers a priority and not trying to make as much money as possible
negative	booked and paid for parking for my holiday , then the confirmation booking says they don_'_t do between 0000 and 0000 hours , but i was still able to book even_though i had put my flight details on the booking so i rang them only to be fobbed_off with an_automated answering message , they don_'_t want to talk to you if there is a problem they want you to email .
negative	so i emailed them , one day later still no response .
negative	they rang me after i gave this review , and said that they would be refunding the money i paid .
negative	however that was over a week_ago , and still no refund has_been processed through my credit_card account .
negative	its a bit worrying ,
negative	jeg_købte_en lumia 000 i telia sidste år med_et 0everything light abonnement det hvor_der_er forsikring .
negative	jeg finder så senere ud_af , at telia af_en eller anden grund har nedgraderet mit_abonnement til noget mindre .
negative	jeg_ringer straks til kundeservice_og_får lavet det om igen , og han forsikrer mig på_det_er forsikring på telefonen igen .
negative	jeg_kommer så ud for det uheldige , at min telefon er gået i stykker og skal laves via forsikring .
negative	men_nu fortæller de mig så inde ved forsikrings selskabet at der_ikke_er noget forsikring at finde , og_jeg_skal snakke_med telia .
negative	jeg går ned i butikken for at høre hvad_der_sker .
negative	han tjekker så og kan_se jeg betaler 000 hver måned .
negative	og han siger jeg_skal ringe_til kundeservice .
negative	jeg_får fat i kundeservice som tjekker min sag igennem , han kan godt se at det_har_været nedgraderet mit_abonnement og_det_er derfor der_ikke længere er forsikring .
negative	da_jeg prøver at forklare ham , at det_er_deres skyld og_jeg_havde snakket med_dem engang før , hvor_de sagde at det_hele skulle_være okay igen .
negative	ja men_det kunne han da_også godt se at der_var skrevet en note , men_det_var altså ikke okay alligevel .
negative	så han kunne_ikke gøre noget og_der_var_ikke rigtigt noget at gøre ved det , udover jeg_kunne give en klage .
negative	det_kan simpelthen_ikke passe at man ringer der ind_og_bliver lovet det_ene , også når_man endelig har brug for det , så_kan_man pludselig ikke længere bruge det .
negative	nu står jeg med_en telefon som_jeg_har betalt 0000 kr .
negative	og kan_ikke få_den lavet fordi telia har lavet en_fejl .
negative	jeg_har ingen telefon så_jeg_kan_ikke afbestille spotify som_jeg åbenbart skal_betale ekstra for nu , og_jeg_kan_ikke få_en låne telefon .
negative	dårlig service .
negative	og ekspedienten i butikken var fuldstændig ubehjælpsom og blev ligefrem provokerende da_jeg_blev sur over deres service .
negative	det her firma er fuldstændig ude at skide hvad angår internet .
negative	lige meget hvor meget jeg skriver ind_og ringer , om mit problem med at mit internet er nede hele_tiden , så forstår de bare_ikke problemet og_bliver ved med at ignorer hvad_jeg skriver .
negative	kan_ikke anbefales
negative	did not have a good experience with parts_geek .
negative	purchased part called handle cable , shipping was more_expensive than part .
negative	part arrived as handle , not cable .
negative	more_expensive to return than part cost .
negative	unable to talk to anyone live .
negative	finally after several emails , was told that the part i needed was not carried by parts_geek .
negative	i '_m now out $_00 . 00 and still looking for a door_handle cable .
negative	i ordered a shipment .
negative	shipped almost_immediately .
negative	called customer service within an_hour or 0 of receiving the usps confirmation number .
negative	the order was shipped with the apt number only .
negative	clearly there is no q / a check .
negative	i told the customer service agent the situation .
negative	he sent an immediate email .
negative	i too sent an immediate email .
negative	never_heard a single word .
negative	i updated my contact information again in your system immediately .
negative	still shipped incorrectly and i have heard a single word .
negative	i also had emailed the usps with the confirmation number and correct information .
negative	not a single word from them either .
negative	now , the package is back in florida and 00 days have passed .
negative	no_idea if i will ever see my order .
negative	i will never again order from your company .
negative	when pyurchasing a item from partsgeek , i expected one charge for what i had purchased .
negative	well there were mutiple charges on my account which one of the charges was unknown .
negative	i choose to purchase the part from another warehouse due to this error .
negative	i purchased an unlock for orange uk ,
negative	when i wrote an_email before i purchased the unlock , i spoke to a guy call james ( company director ) he assured me at the time there was no issue with orange uk unlocks and they are going through in the time advertised which is 0 - 0 days .
negative	on my order status page my imei was submitted to the unlock server on the 0st of may , now its the 00th of may and my iphone still isn_'_t unlocked .
negative	the next_day after i purchased my unlock james seems to have vanished into thin air , although he was writing to me quite often before the money changed hands .
negative	now the unlcok for orange uk seems to have been withdrawn from their service and i '_m being told by stephanie i should wait_till the service resumes .
negative	( they have offered a refund now though )
negative	my issue is , why was i told by james there was no issue with orang uk unlocks and literally 0 days after i purchased my unlock the service was stopped for that carrier
negative	very unhappy and feel i '_m being lied to .
negative	was told my item shipped 000 $
negative	0_weeks_later i called to see what '_s going on
negative	and was told it will shop that day another week_later i call again and was told the item is 0_weeks back ordered from the supplier ( schluter ) so i call a different supplier if mine he says he can have it over night at his ware house that schluter has it in stock at their warehouse and the part would only cost 000 $
negative	tried getting a hold if ecomfort but was hung_up on .
negative	i ordered a set of brake_rotors for a dodge_ram ; received a set labled for a chevy ; measurements of rotor thickness is different hat height is different ; not my fault you guys send wrong parts but you tell me i must pay to return something i did not order .
negative	i requested a rma_number on 0 / 00 / 0000 opened ticket 000000 for order number 0000000 and have not heard back from parts_geek .
negative	i do not feel this is good customer_relations .
negative	i order a cd , and a dvd as a birthday_gift , expecting for both to arrive on the same day .
negative	it turns_out , they were out of stock on the cd , i did not find out until i called them .
negative	the feedback was that as soon as it was in stock they would send it out .
negative	i didn_'_t need the cd in 0 - 0_weeks , i needed it when i ordered it .
negative	first off i would like to say you are the biggest rip_off on the web . this is absolutely an error on your part .
negative	if you look up the part number for a 0000_dodge_ram thats the part number but its not the right part for that year truck . that makes it your error not mine .
negative	at this time iam still out $_00 . 00 and no part due to your error . i i wish i had read the reviews because most of them gave you a very poor rating .
negative	if you try and call these_people if you can find there phone_number its a message that tells you to send them an_email which will be read by someone_who doesnt care about whats fair to the customer .
negative	i would advise anyone_who reads this not to deal with this company !
negative	i have been going to mavis for many_years and yesterday was very frustrating to me .
negative	i had to redo my roters and brakes after doing them 0 months earlier .
negative	they claim that the tech informed me that one of my calipers was locking up and that is why my car was making grinding noises .
negative	so now i am paying for work that i shouldn_'_t have payed for .
negative	$_000_dollars to replace my caliper , brake flush , rotors and brakes .
negative	money that i was not expecting to spend .
negative	although they did fix the problem this time mavis let_me down .
negative	everything that was suppost to be final payment to stay at the hotel ended_up to be 000 more !
negative	very disappointed , probly won_'_t every go threw travelocity ever again
negative	we made the mistake of buying a part for my husband '_s truck from partsgeek .
negative	we will never make that mistake again !
negative	ordering was the easy part , getting the order was a completely different story though .
negative	we made sure that we provided the correct mailing_address , but the idiots at the warehouse used the wrong_address , so in order to find our part , we started with the shipper , who were no help as we were told that it was delivered as adressed and that we had to go to the seller .
negative	then things went down_hill from there .
negative	first , we could not get through to a live_person .
negative	we tried every way we could think of to get through to customer service , but could not get through to a live human_being .
negative	so , we created a service ticket , which_meant " hurry up and wait_until we decide to deal with your issue ".
negative	still no contact from the company at this point , and we are minus the money and the part .
negative	then , when i tried once more to get through , i had no joy because i could not get a second service ticket or a live_person .
negative	finally they deigned to give me a refund , minus a " stocking_fee " for a part that we never got .
negative	nice .
negative	and still no contact with a live_person !
negative	so , lesson_learned .
negative	do not waste your time or your money buying from this company !
negative	they are complete idiots and frauds !
negative	we are also filing a complaint with the bbb and our state '_s ag for fraud , because of the " stocking_fee " for a part we never recieved .
negative	you know bob , if you buy a lot or a little parts on - line , then do yourself a favor and keep far away from partsgeek . com they are the worst service that you can get , or try to get , ahold of ..
negative	if you need to ask anything about your order , or if you question if the fitment is right , then you have to email them to get an answer .
negative	i put in an order , then 00min later i needed to change it , as i ordered the wrong part number .
negative	so partsgeek would not allow me to cancel or change it to the correct part , so i had to make a different order with the correct item , so now i have $_000 . 00 invested for my $_000 item .
negative	now i have to go through the hassle of paying to return the wrong item , plus pay a restocking_fee , all because i coundnt get_ahold of anyone to get help on ordering to correct item .
negative	so screw partsgeek , i will never use them again !!

negative	we are still_waiting for parts to arrive
negative	i ordered a replacement_screen from screencountry . com but because i travel a lot , was not able to get around to replacing it within 0 days of arrival .
negative	when i did get around to installing , it connected perfectly and came up correctly , however once the bezel was clipped back in place , the screen displayed an irregular pattern .
negative	i reported this to screencountry and they stated that it must have been damaged in transit and as it was beyond the 0 day period the only_thing they could do was apply a store credit for the shipping .
negative	needless to say , i have sourced my next replacement_screen from somewhere_else ... and will not be using screen_country again
negative	possibly my fault but i don_'_t feel that i was advised that by booking thru_travelocity i can not earn reward_points from the hotel for my stay and also that when i tried to cancel the last day of my stay due to bad_weather , i found that i had to pay for the night regardless .
negative	if i book thru the hotel direct i get the reward_points and can cancel up to 0 pm of each night with no penalty .
negative	as such i will not use this service again .
negative	parts_geek cancelled my order with no specific reason_why .
negative	most_likely , out of stock .
negative	a back order notice would have been more appropriate .
negative	i bought a tent and got a very expensive festival experience ruined .
negative	i do not understand how a company can sell a tent which is not even the slightest bit water_proof ??
negative	a tents main purpose : shelter .
negative	the useless one sold me flooded on the first night .
negative	the rain wasnt even just coming through seems , it was dripping straight through the material !!
negative	i had to abandon the thing at 0 . 00 am , soaked and freezing and sleep in some random persons tent .
negative	absolutely terrible .
negative	and wouldn_'_t budge on refunding me ( i left the tent as it was completely waterlogged )
negative	i regret having to write a bad review but do appreciate the request .
negative	the ordering_process was easy and the delivery was on time .
negative	however , once i opened the package and discovered the part was not as ordered i was very disappointed .
negative	the description did not match what was listed on the web_page .
negative	once the communication started for returning my order the real frustration started .
negative	after many emails regarding the part , if they offered what i needed and the refund / return process i have reached the end of my being understanding .
negative	i have returned the product as required and now waiting on a response for my refund minus restocking charges and shipping cost that i had to pay even_though it was not my fault .
negative	i will never order from this site again and pending on how fast their response is regarding my refund i will rewrite this review and others .
negative	a very disappointed customer !
negative	!
negative	" terrible experience , my worse concerns with the website came true .
negative	after_placing the order the never sent , or send a order confirmation ...
negative	so i was not able to confirm over via_email the color of glasses ordered , then when i called they said they would get back to me ... next thing you know i have a tracking_number for the item in question .
negative	color was wrong and yet they refuse to exchange for correct colorway ... very simple request , and seemingly simple problem for customer service turned into a complete fiasco - the below is an_email response - one of about 0 in a row - from ' becky ' at their company :
negative	" you can do what you want and i will show you how easily i have an open and shut case with amex .
negative	i will fight you tooth and nail boss , i have your live_chat conversation you ordered the wrong item .
negative	it happens , i understand take the hit for it , its your fault not mine .
negative	becky s ."
negative	furthermore , i would not be surprised if this company is all run by the same person , just uses different names to create layers of separation from problem_solving .
negative	i should have paid the difference and just bought the pair at a local sunglass shop ...
negative	furthermore a local shop seems to believe the sunglasses are not even authentic ... maybe knockoffs ... beware
negative	"
negative	trustpilot differs from other customer review websites in that it accepts fees directly from some of the companies being reviewed enabling them to solicit consumer - generated advertising .
negative	i tried to book a flight , they charged my credit_card for over $ 0000 and never received a confirmation # or anything .
negative	worst customer experience in the world , nobody has helped_me out , they hung_up on me multiple_times when trying to transfer my call to another department ...
negative	i wouldn_'_t buy flights from expedia ever again even if they were 00_% cheaper , they will screw you and it will be a nightmare
negative	choosing big_bus was the worst decision that i made in planning my trip to london .
negative	they have a very unprofessional staffs that drop you out of the bus and send you to meet other staff 0 bus_stop further , finding no one over there .
negative	after i went back to the same bus back 0 bus_stop before , i found the same staff that puts me in an overcrowded bus without a specific estimated departure time and we were eventually sent by them to walk a few blocks down and take the underground to go to the london_eye .
negative	on our recent christmas holiday trip to cebu , philippines , we had a horrible hotel experience with absolutely no help from agoda .
negative	on the agoda website we discovered the ( deceptively marketed ) grand regency hotel and towers in cebu city .
negative	there is no mention anywhere that this facility is not affiliated with the regency hotel group or hyatt regency .
negative	it is another cheap philippine “ knock - off ” – fraud – which is so common in that country .
negative	yet , agoda does not intervene or provide warning .
negative	the following recaps our experience :
negative	after booking with agoda , i immediately discovered that we were being charged $_00 .
negative	usd per_night extra for our 00 year_old daughter , even_though the hotel ’_s policy was children under 00 stay for free .
negative	after arguing back & forth via_email , agoda finally conceded and credited my visa_card the overcharged amount .
negative	secondly , i found that asiatravel . com offered a rate totaling_$_000 .
negative	usd less_than agoda .
negative	when challenged under their “ price guarantee ” program , agoda cited “ ever - so - slightly ” different verbiage in their policies .
negative	it was insulting , agoda has no “ price guarantee ”, it is just a scam .
negative	it was however my error for not shopping ( in depth ) the competition ahead of time .
negative	agoda : never again , they are deceitful .
negative	after driving for 00_hours , we arrived at the regency hotel & towers .
negative	it was immediately obvious that we had been scammed : all around poor quality , banking on the name “ regency hotel ” to draw unsuspecting customers .
negative	we arrived at the check - in counter shortly_after 0pm on december 00 .
negative	the staff seemed confused with the agoda booking .
negative	they were unable to find our reservation .
negative	it took over an_hour for them to provide us a room .
negative	throughout the check - in process the defective overhead “ air con ” rained water down on us and the paperwork .
negative	never a mention of it , or word of apology from the staff for the “ rain ” or lengthy wait .
negative	check - in staff said that there was one , not two queen_beds as_advertised , but they would have a bed brought in for our daughter .
negative	there was no valet_parking , and the parking garage was full .
negative	we had to wait in our car , in the garage for over 00_minutes until attendants “ found ” a space .
negative	we finally got into our “ corner room suite ” at 0 : 00_pm and found no extra bed .
negative	at 00 : 00 , and after 0 phone_calls to the front_desk , still no bed .
negative	the front_desk did not answer the phone on our 0rd call to them for over 0 minutes .
negative	we just put it on speakerphone and let it ring .
negative	at 00 : 00 , housekeeping delivered a cheap foam pad and placed it on the floor calling it “ a bed ”.
negative	at 00 : 00 the it staff telephoned , wanting to come up and manually connect my laptop to the hotel ’_s lan since they offered no wireless connection .
negative	this connection procedure would remove the isp configuration we use at home .
negative	we were already in bed trying to sleep when this call came in .
negative	at this point we called the front_desk , told them we were very displeased and requested a meeting with the hotel manager in the early morning .
negative	the “ corner room suite ” was not a corner room , although it was slightly_larger than a “ superior ”.
negative	there was one wall of windows and a 0 foot glass panel on the adjacent wall – behind which is an elevator shaft ( hardly a corner ).
negative	however , the room assigned was below the surrounding infrastructure and all you see are industrial plant rooms in the adjacent building .
negative	you cannot see outside of the complex whatsoever .
negative	.
negative	.
negative	what then may i ask , is the purpose of a “ corner suite ” if not for the panoramic view of the city that it supposedly affords ?
negative	the hotel restaurants only serve “ buffet style ” dining , no sit down dinner available for my wife ’_s birthday !
negative	we ordered cadillac margaritas .
negative	however , this “ upscale facility ” does not stock gran marnier .
negative	we also tried to order a simple warm drambuie for after dinner .
negative	.
negative	.
negative	they didn_’ t have a clue .
negative	no kahlua for the coffee in the morning , no mimosa for breakfast either !
negative	the “ café ” which isn ’ t a buffet style is simply a “ snack bar ” offering nothing more than fish & chips and sandwiches .
negative	there are only 0 elevators for over 00 floors and the wait time is horrendous as the car is full when the doors open & you have to wait again , and again !
negative	the elevators offered no access to our 0th_floor accommodations due to an architectural design flaw in the remodeling of the building .
negative	we had to get off on the 00th floor and take the stairs back down to the 0th_floor to get to our room .
negative	this “ special birthday ” for my wife was turning into a disaster !
negative	the following_morning , december_00th , we were out of the room with luggage in our car well before 0 : 00 a . m . after a considerable wait , we spoke with the hotel manager at 0 : 00 a . m .
negative	he instructed us not to check out until they contacted agoda .
negative	at 00 : 00 , he informed me that they had made several_attempts to contact agoda , but were unable to do so .
negative	he specifically stated that : “ agoda is extremely difficult to contact ”.
negative	at that point , he instructed me to contact agoda via_email and to enter urgent in the subject line .
negative	i composed a detailed email and mailed it off to agoda shortly_after 00 : 00 .
negative	agoda failed to respond until after 0pm .
negative	later , agoda attempted to blame me for the delay !
negative	the one night that we did stay there was because at 00 : 00 at night it is difficult to book elsewhere !
negative	agoda claims 00 / 0 service .
negative	however , i emailed agoda 0 times after their 0pm response , asking for help in booking elsewhere .
negative	i received no reply until 00_hours_later and was forced to make other arrangements myself .
negative	as a result of agoda ’_s misrepresentation and incompetence , my family spent most of the first day of our vacation in the “ low end ” quality lobby of the “ grand regency ” .
negative	.
negative	.
negative	on my wife ’_s birthday .
negative	agoda has since refused to refund our payment .
negative	we instructed our visa_card company to cancel payment .
negative	we should be demanding compensation from agoda in addition to a full_refund !
negative	charged me for 0 plugs ( 0 . 0 v - 0 toyota t - 000 0000 ) and shipped only four .
negative	had to run to the parts store as they were closing to get the other two .
negative	never again !
negative	i place an for a radiator on 0 / 00 and on 0 / 00 0000 u cancel the order
negative	but didnt even give a courtesy_call ??
negative	thats fucked up i will take my business elsewhere from now on !!
negative	!
negative	i ordered 0 parts .
negative	i received 0 of the parts very quickly within 0 days .
negative	however , 0 of the parts have never been received , but partsgeek and the shipping company says the order is completed and delivered .
negative	i received two packages with the shipping labels for the 0 parts , but one of the sealed packages was completely empty and the second only contained 0 of the 0 parts .
negative	within 00_hours of receiving the empty_box , i submitted a customer service notice on the partsgeek webpage and also faxed a copy to them .
negative	i never received a reply or call back and they made no attempt to address the issue .
negative	therefore , they left me no choice but i had to file a dispute for the payment with american_express .
negative	i had hoped that my disputing the credit_card payment for the partial amount would get them to contact me , but i have yet to hear from them .
negative	i will not pay for empty sealed boxes that they said they sent parts to me but did not .
negative	it has_been two_weeks , and have not yet heard from parts_geek .
negative	now had to file a complaint with the better business_bureau .
negative	ordered 0 sun loungers , web_page said in stock , paid_extra for next_day , did not arrive .
negative	got a phone_call after the delivery date saying they only had one .
negative	they offered an_alternative at more money , we accepted and had an_email to say next_day delivery .
negative	only one turned_up , the other arrived the next_day !
negative	the product is fine they just need to use a better courier .
negative	have asked for compensation for lost time waiting in but has fallen on deaf_ears , will have to county court them .
negative	they need some lessons in customer service .
negative	make you own decision when ordering .
negative	i was impressed with price , however if you cant get said item price doesnt_matter .
negative	the website showed item in stock .
negative	( 0 ) i ordered item .
negative	wasted 0 days trying to figure_out why i was not contacted .
negative	my credit_card was charged .
negative	i tried to contact the company by phone .
negative	good luck with that .
negative	turns_out you have to use a ticket by email .
negative	i was finally contacted by email and told item was out of stock and that i had been emailed to that effect .
negative	all i know is i never received the email to that effect .
negative	now the credit charge againist my card was withdrawn by company , thank_you .
negative	bottom_line i cant reccomend this company and i wont use again .
negative	due to no fault of mine , between march and may i received the wrong parts for two orders .
negative	i was required to ensure the parts were returned and the initial shipping_costs that i paid were not refunded .
negative	no way to do_business !
negative	a .
negative	performance generally good though not fantastic .
negative	testing the download and upload at different parts of the day , good for most of the time .
negative	b .
negative	0 outages within 0_weeks though fixing it is fast .
negative	reason backend changes .
negative	in the first place , backend changes shouldn_'_t affect client or at_least validate it does not impact client .
negative	c . customer service needs to improve .
negative	wrong billing and when contacted , bouncing call to different party .
negative	no single point of owning the issue .
negative	d . given the issues and contacts experience so_far , it doesn_'_t warranty the high premium paid compare to other_providers .
negative	e . poor to extremely low technical competency staff to resolve issue .
negative	internet could be down with more than 00_hours without resolution .
negative	booked a trip to new_orleans march 00 - 00 .
negative	they offered a free jazz brunch @ court of two sister which never happened because they screwed_up our reservations .
negative	even after my wife and i showed_up the day before just to make_sure their was no confusion with our reservation .
negative	they said we didn_'_t have one i tried to remake the reservation again and they said they were booked .
negative	so i went to my hotel around the corner printed the confirmation_email along with the voucher went back to show them and they wouldn_'_t talk to me .
negative	i asked to speak with the manager and they said no !
negative	and made us leave the building .
negative	something similar happened to us last_year in jamaica with a excursion we book online with bookit . com were that company canceled our boating trip with them the day of the trip via_email .
negative	i don_'_t think bookit . com realizes who they ' re setting_up with once they get to there destination
negative	these_people promised me a battlefield_0 origin product code .... what did i get ?
negative	a product code to receive a battlefield_0 code from the amd website which by the way was invalid ... i immediately submitted a ticket only to get the response that it was now out of their hands ... thanks for screwing me out of 00 some odd dollars guys dont expect anymore out of my wallet , and hopefully i will save others from getting duped as well ... i '_m pretty sure that rating is not quite right .... so disappointed ....
negative	i was two mile across town and wanted to make_sure i had a room before i drove over .
negative	i searched best western and called what i thought was reservations .
negative	she quoted me best rate of $_00 . 00 the bill came to $_000 with all their charges , including $_00 . 00 booking_fee which i told her better not be on there .
negative	when i got to the check in the rate should have been $_00 plus_tax .
negative	they overcharged me , charged me a service fee and i could hardly understand the dialect of anyone i talked with .
negative	they are rude and very pushy .
negative	she badgered me into committing into approving the charge to my credit_card .
negative	do not use travelocity !
negative	i order a set of struts and the struts are worst than the set is already on it so i watn to sent it back and get a better set and now they want me to pay to ship it back i will never buy from this company again
negative	it was a guessing game when . i received my . emaim about by . order .
negative	it just stated grill assembly which did not describe my . order .
negative	i attempted to contact u guys thru e_mail and was sent four words not . even a full sentence .
negative	i really want my friends to use u . guys but it really means alot when a company takes time to do .
negative	a little more one on one with customers
negative	booked a 0 - star_hotel in covina , and got a rat - nest ( stayed there before , i have pictures to prove it ).
negative	customer service will read you a piece of paper with at standard reply , no matter if you talk to the first person or next line of defence ( brandon , thanks for nothing ) .
negative	they simply do not listen to their customers , and they simply dont care .
negative	use priceline at your own peril !
negative	hotwire is better if you are willing to bid blind .
negative	never received confirmation on booking .
negative	the day before my travel , i received an_email_requesting that i buy insurance .
negative	surprised , i mailed back that i never received word that the booking had gone_through , and i therefore had booked another car .
negative	they wanted 00 dollars for cxl the booking they never confirmed .
negative	i guess they are just one of the many cowboy companies on the web .
negative	well , this is one horse i will never ride again .
negative	thanks for nothing .
negative	and send me an_email thanking_me for my money !
negative	!
negative	and , heheha ...
negative	this poor lady must be the busiest person in the universe !!

negative	unfortunately , my try - on glasses never arrived .
negative	after two_weeks of waiting i checked the facebook_page and learned that they '_ve closed shop .
negative	too bad .
negative	i order a fan_assembly for a /_c condenser on dodge_ram on friday , thought it would be here in couple of days took a week . box was crushed part look like it was re - manufactured 0 / 0 painted . i called got recording , then e_-_mail get a auto - e_-_mail letter . very poor customer service .
negative	part works , but if it didn_'_t i would have returned it . don_'_t spend your money with this company .
negative	the reservation process was confusing and took too_long , approximately 00_minutes .
negative	the representative asked questions that were irrelevant and he was unwilling to negotiate or offer discounts such as aarp .
negative	would prefer to call hotel_directly and will do so in the future .
negative	i spend so much on calling without_any help
negative	thought prices were unbelievable compared to usa firms and my email questions are always answered_promptly given the time difference , however , about a week after the components arrived i received an invoice from ups package services for over $_000 for customs fees and brokerage .
negative	this pushed the whole_transaction into being more_expensive than several us mail order firms .
negative	worse yet , the extra_cost is a total nasty surprise .
negative	nowhere in the ordering_process were the customs fee mentioned nor was there any suggestion of a separate billing from any other agency .
negative	additionally my recent_purchase of a set of wheels arrived in oem packaging that had been opened to put a cassette in the same box as the wheels .
negative	the cassette box was not well secured and the wheel packaging was torn and sloppily repacked .
negative	no damage occurred but still ... not really what i expected .
negative	merlin is not a place i recommend or will be using in the future .
negative	ok , so i purchased a tub of ' complete probiotic ' price wasn_'_t fantastic , but i had a code for a fiver off .. delivery was within a couple days , but i had to pay for delivery .. oh well ..
negative	i had opted for the larger sized tub ( 000 tabs over the 00 ).
negative	on the back of the tub it recommends taking 0 a day .. so approx 0 months worth .
negative	they arrived on the 00nd march ... but had a use by date of 00th_june ... this was a little too close to comfort for me as i hadn_'_t planned on almost_immediately starting to take these , and some days you forget , and i have 0_weeks hols booked etc etc a month or twos grace would be nice .. meaning that they will be out of date before i finish them .
negative	expecting them to have the same proactive approach other_companies i use do ( isupp , myprotein , muscle_foods , the protein_works etc .. i spend a lot on stuff like this ) i got in touch with bulk_powders and explained this situation , saying it wasn_'_t great and my friend who also purchased these a few_months back has a bbe date of 00 sept ..!!
negative	how does that work ?
negative	so i wait a few_days for a reply .. and nothing ....!!
negative	great customer service !!
negative	i then got in touch again saying this wasn_'_t very good please reply to my initial email .
negative	they did later that day , weren_'_t hugely apologetic and said they are in date .
negative	so obviously didn_'_t really read my problem .
negative	they did offer me 00_% refund in the form of bulk powder points .
negative	i didn_'_t accept this as it was a pathetic gesture and didnt really resolve my problem , and on top of that their customer service was slow and half hearted .
negative	i won_'_t be using them again .. never had a problem with myprotein or any other company .
negative	take_note bulk_powders , you '_ve lost a potential regular customer .
negative	bad_experience ordered product and waited several days .
negative	fairly received an_email_saying out of stock and order cancelled .
negative	looking to other website to fulfill my order .
negative	incorrect parts received .
negative	what could have been handled in a brief phone conversation has dragged on for more than a week .
negative	despite providing our phone_number and repeated_requests for a phone_call partsgeek continued to respond via_e : mail only with up to 0 days before receiving a response .
negative	finally received an address and return number to return 0 of the 0 parts that were in error .
negative	have received no communications on the other part .
negative	very disappointed with the service we '_ve received and the inability to discuss order issues via phone .
negative	everything was fine from ordering but the flowers arrived as a birthday_present were not good quality .
negative	the flowers arrived in a small box , some of the flowers were dead and some of the flower heads had come off .
negative	i don ` t think that i will be using iflorist in the future .
negative	when i tried to order the parts , i got no aknowledgement of the order , and i received no parts , fortunantly i was glad to see the money was returned to my credit_card , and i was able to order the parts i needed somewhere_else .
negative	i can not and will not refer partsgeek to anyone_else looking for car parts
negative	spoke to 0 reps . and 0 superviser , charged more than i was supost to .
negative	all said they would fix and none followed thru .
negative	the stuff i needed came
negative	over a week late .
negative	had to go buy chlorine tabs from local pool store .
negative	finally got a hold of customer service and got the price ajustment
negative	and handleing charge back .
negative	your guarntee is worthless as well
negative	as the customer service and randy the superviser .
negative	i have placed five orders with wowcher , mainly presents for my girlfriend .
negative	the first was a bra .
negative	it was not made clear from the description that this firm specialises in bras for big girls - the smallest they had was 00dd .
negative	as she is very petite , no good to me .
negative	the second was for a bracelet .
negative	it turned_up on time , and was just as_described , but for weeks afterwards i was bombarded with e_-_mails_asking me why i hadn_'_t placed the order yet .
negative	the third was for a pair of silk knickers .
negative	order went through perfectly , and arrived on time .
negative	the fourth was for a set of towels .
negative	some sort of computer glitch prevented me from placing the order , so i complained to wowcher .
negative	they offered to do it for me , and i accepted that offer .
negative	no towels .
negative	eventually i complained , and was told that my wowcher had expired .
negative	i reminded them of their promise , and was given a naff reference to the law of contract , while in fact my issue had to do with the law of agency .
negative	after taking the matter a bit higher in the company , i got a refund , but no towels .
negative	the fifth was for a set of jewellery .
negative	i got an e_-_mail telling_me to complete the order by clicking on the links provided .
negative	there were no links , only lifeless text .
negative	i complained , and got an e_-_mail containing live links , which i have used .
negative	i just hope i get the jewellery .
negative	if not ...
negative	i have already alerted my mp to wowcher '_s organisational shortcomings , and will keep him updated .
negative	birthdays for germans are holy days .
negative	if you don_'_t congratulate a german on her / his_birthday you have insulted that person .
negative	a week in advance of a friend '_s birthday , i ordered flowers from floraqueen to be delivered on may 0 .
negative	the flowers were not delivered .
negative	i complained .
negative	floraqueen said they tried to deliver the flowers and left a note , but this was not the case .
negative	my friend was at home all day waiting .
negative	there was no delivery notice .
negative	no delivery on saturday .
negative	no delivery on monday .
negative	after sending floraqueen some 0 irate emails , i was told that my friend had to call dhl to arrange for the delivery or just pick_up the flowers himself .
negative	this is an insult to me and my friend .
negative	this is not what i paid for .
negative	the whole_process has caused me tons of grief when it was supposed to be a happy joyful surprise .
negative	stay_away from floraqueen .
negative	any other florist but floraqueen .
negative	partgeek let_me submit a part of the order with 0 day shipping , and shipped everything ground refusing to credit me for 0 day shipping .
negative	nad customre s
negative	slow service , car needs parts , received one of three , 00 days and counting .
negative	parts_geek sucks !
negative	i can '_t get a hold of anyone to change my flights due to cancellation .
negative	the flights i need will be full by the time american_airlines calls me back .
negative	the first car vw i thought it would breakdown on the way to our first meeting .
negative	i planned on booking thru hotels . com , to get my free rewards there ..... but i called this number , thinking that i was calling the hotel , because i wanted to ask about the parking situation there .
negative	instead i reached this booking company .
negative	the representative said he could book the room for me and assured me that the booking would be reflected on my hotels . com account to go towards my free room .
negative	well , to make a long_story short ... he was not truthful , and the credit has not shown up on hotels . com account .
negative	wont use them again .
negative	i received the wrong part three_times and now moust wait 00 days for my money back .
negative	i had to go to a store and pruchase the part and wait over amonth for my car to be fixed .
negative	i should have received my refund immediately after sending the inccorrect part back .
negative	part different than factory original ; upon close examination ( not possible from a picture ), replacement cover is missing tabs to hold bolt clips in place , and also holes do not line up as the factory original does .
negative	if you ' re looking to do the job correctly , use the factory original part .
negative	microsoft is a money leach !
negative	!
negative	horrid is a good word to sum it up .
negative	im basically told that wepay will dictate the income of my business and i have no guarenteed course of action to change the extremely low limit put on my business .
negative	everywhere it is advertised that after a payment is processed the funds are deposited_into my account the next business day .
negative	something that is completely untrue .
negative	wepay puts the money into a " pending " status for a number of days .
negative	in my case thursday , friday , sarturday and finally released om sunday .
negative	we all know no business occurs on sunday so this is obviously a waiting period that is no where near the industry_standard .
negative	i could go to [_external link ], have my funds availble instantly on thursday withdraw the funds and have them deposited by friday , the latest monday .
negative	after you hold my money hostage for a long time , then only 000 is released to my bank_account which doesnt arrive monday , it takes 0 business days and arrives tuesday .
negative	when i realize my cash_flow is being held hostage , i call the company to ask what recourse i have and im consistently hung_up on no matter what option i choose in their ivr .
negative	after waiting more than the guarenteed 000 mins for a response from email support im told its due to the " trust level of my industry ."
negative	i fear wepay understands nothing about my industry because they would realize no company can survive on 000 a week when dealing_with guarenteed credit_card transactions .
negative	the only reason im given is it is an industry_standard , which is a lie .
negative	no payment_processor from [_external link ] to [_external link ] holds funds for up to a week " incase of chargebacks ".
negative	wepay is cheap , uneducated and has zero connection to their customers .
negative	i tried every kind of payment : credit_card , paypal , skrill , ukash .
negative	and always order cancelled .
negative	then completly suspended my account .
negative	now i am using [_external reference_].
negative	i am very happy with them .
negative	if you are filtering orders based on countries , why saying worldwide service .
negative	remember there was a movie with tom hanks - the money pit .
negative	he bought a really cheap good - looking house but after that everything started to fall appart and he realized that it was broken , and it costed him not only money but time , relationship and more to fix it .
negative	using this site - allcdkey . com , is the same experience !
negative	you are dragged by the cheap price , but what you receive is comparable only to nightmare .
negative	i ordered diablo_iii ros yesterday .
negative	got confirmation mail that i will need to provide information back - like id scan , photo and such .
negative	usual practice of such websites because they are targeted by scammers and credit_card / paypal frauds .
negative	i do understand in someway their intentions .
negative	so i did provide what they wanted .
negative	of course removing the sensitive information .
negative	0h passed and still no key .
negative	so i decided to contact their " 00 / 0 " support .
negative	oooo my god !
negative	what a terrible support !!!
negative	after - sale , pre_- sale - the same person !!!!
negative	only one person !
negative	and i waited for like 00_mins before i received an answer .
negative	the answer was and i quote since i saved the conversation : - " plz hold on ".
negative	wait what ?
negative	you are telling_me to wait more ?
negative	i waited and my frustration was getting high .
negative	while i waited i had time to look through their website .
negative	there is no and i will state it again so everybody can read it no information if this is real company !!!!
negative	0 phones listed , couple of mails and that '_s it .
negative	looks_like complete scam .
negative	so i got an answer from the nice lady - amy lee who was really bad with english .
negative	she told me to send a picture of me holding the id ( only my hand holding the id ).
negative	i did .
negative	then asked me to send the address .
negative	i did .
negative	of course again removing all sensitive information .
negative	and you can '_t imagine what she told me next - plz send this to softislandfifa @ foxmail . com ( yes i do hope spammers will go to this e_-_mail !!!!).
negative	i asked why not checking the support @ allcdkey . com ( spammers target here too pls ).
negative	because she doesn_'_t have access to this mail .
negative	wait how is this possible ?
negative	the support doesn_'_t have access to the support mail inbox ?
negative	are you kidding me ?
negative	for real ?
negative	but wait , before i had even time to say something she wrote - can you contact us after 00_mins .
negative	my shift is over and we are restarting the system ....
negative	i was like ??!?!?!?!?!?!?!
negative	couldn_'_t believe it at all .
negative	and imagine - she even closed the chat !!!!
negative	!
negative	i was astonished by this rudeness so i fired up my phone and started dialing the two numbers listed in their website under contact us section .
negative	yes , if you '_ve red until here you would know that nobody picked the damn phones !!!!
negative	the second one actually connects you through some kind of a modem .
negative	hope it '_s not a scam telephone_number , but hey my bill will come soon so i will update you .
negative	i didn_'_t give up of course .
negative	went to their site and opened a dispute with them for refund .
negative	but while waiting and believe me it was around 00_mins i decided to contact the support again .
negative	this time nicole answered ( again after 00_mins of waiting 0 people before me ).
negative	i explained gave order information and what she replied back was amazing - what country are you in - i gave it to her .
negative	but you made the purchase from another country .
negative	wait what ?
negative	another country ?
negative	then i remembered that i really made the purchase from another country .
negative	my working laptop uses vpn to connect to intranet and internet and probably was because of that .
negative	and for the second chat i moved to my own laptop .
negative	anyway made a whois gave her the ip and she said - plz send the id to softislandfifa @ foxmail . com .
negative	i was again really frustrated because this was total bull @ hit .
negative	but i sensed it was close to finally get my key and sent the info there .
negative	after around 00_mins she replied - we approve .
negative	wait what ?
negative	approved ?
negative	did i read that correctly ?
negative	and ta daaa my key was in my inbox .
negative	i couldn_'_t believe it !
negative	it took me 0h hours , 000 of phone_calls to phones which nobody picks_up , 0 chats ( 0 in total because on the first one my i - net connection dropped me ), sending photos to mails and a looooooooooooot of nerves to get it .
negative	compared to their statement that key is usually sent in 00_mins !
negative	total lie !
negative	just a lie !
negative	so if you want to go through all the above , please head on to their site and order a key .
negative	just remember , your life will be a lot shorter after that because of the nerves you '_ve spent with this so called merchant !
negative	i have had the worst experience of my life with your company .
negative	i called choose a room on tuesday may_00th to book a room for two at the holiday_inn express in lynnwood , washington for 0 nights ( june 00t , 00th and 00th ).
negative	this reservation was handled by carlos .
negative	first of all , i had trouble understanding him , which i let him know .
negative	he tried to book me into a hotel in longwood , washington .
negative	i had to repeat the name of the town and even gave him the address to make_sure he booked the right place .
negative	he allegedly was having_trouble with his computer , but , eventually got the booking completed .
negative	i was charged $_000 . 00 on my account .
negative	an_email was sent to me confirming the booking for that amount and the dates i wanted .
negative	he had a post_office box number as my mailing_address .
negative	i do not have a box number .
negative	i have a street address .
negative	i have no_idea where he came up with the box number .
negative	he only asked for my zip_code .
negative	when i checked my account the following_day , i discovered that it had been charged 0 times for over $ 0000 .
negative	i immediately got on the phone and called the company .
negative	they gave_me a different number to call to resolve the problem .
negative	after calling the new number , i was given yet another number to call and was told to ask for a manager , which i did .
negative	his_name was allan .
negative	i lost the connection and called back .
negative	at that time i asked to speak to allan as i was just cut_off .
negative	the agent refused to connect me to him .
negative	this annoyed me to no end .
negative	she then gave_me yet another number to call .
negative	at every number i called , i was told they only showed one charge .
negative	when i checked my account again on may_00th , i discovered that there was 0 charges on my account for $_000 . 00 .
negative	i called the phone_number showing on those transactions and talked to peter .
negative	i explained the problem to him and he said the reservation was booked twice , when everyone told me they only showed one charge .
negative	i did not book 0 rooms . i told peter i wanted $_000 . 00 credited back to my account immediately .
negative	he said it would take 00_hours to complete the transaction .
negative	in the meantime , my account was frozen by your company .
negative	i was embarrassed when my card was declined at a local merchant , knowing that i had more than enough funds to cover the purchases . i cannot and will not give any sort of favorable review to your company .
negative	one is the lowest rating you have , but , i would rate you less_than zero .
negative	all my friends and family will be informed of what to expect from your company .
negative	the better business_bureau will also be contacted .
negative	i tried_calling the phone_number you listed in an_email to me for this review .
negative	i was on hold for over 00_minutes and never did talk to anyone .
negative	was everyone on lunch_break ?
negative	most of the agents i talked to were very hard for me to understand and i mentioned that to them .
negative	your company needs english_speaking people who can speak fluently .
negative	i '_m sure nothing will come of this review , or if i will hear back from you .
negative	your link to this review also does not work .
negative	thank_you for making my blood_pressure rise and for embarrassing me at the merchants store .
negative	if you should choose to contact me , my phone # is 000 - 000 - 0000 .
negative	this place was horrible .
negative	first off it seems like there were drug deals going on in some of the rooms .
negative	my shower was louder than a jet taking off .
negative	my bed sheets had what looked like bullet holes .
negative	i felt_like i had to sleep with one open the entire time i was there .
negative	my daughter and i placed my order for a helmet and pads on 00 / 00 / 00 hoping to receive them before or even after christmas .
negative	my daughter was super excited and would check the website everyday to see how far the process has_gone along .
negative	it never moved pass the second stage .
negative	i then found out that the money i had spent on the gear was put back onto my card .
negative	i tired using the " live " help on the website to try and figure_out why this happened .
negative	after two attempts and no answer to my questions i had to tell my daughter that the helmet wasnt coming and i couldnt tell her why .
negative	this website has poor service and lack of information .
negative	next time ill just order from amazon
negative	i was told when i placed an order that the pool_cover would be five feet wider on each side in order to fit over pool .
negative	that was a lie .
negative	i ordered cover for 00x00 pool and got a 00 foot cover .
negative	useless to me .
negative	a crappy way to run business .
negative	guess what i will order from this company in the future ?
negative	why would they not want repeat_customers ?
negative	after email contact with a represenative , i was offered less_than half of my purchase price .
negative	he was very nice and courteous .
negative	he seemed like a super guy .
negative	however , i personally talked with customer service and explained what i was needing to order before i made an online purchase .
negative	i was assured by the represenative that she understood what i was wanting when i ordered my pool_cover .
negative	in my business when i make a mistake , it does not cost my customer anything .
negative	half of my purchase price is not a way to correct their mistake .
negative	the pool company can print whatever they want and say i misunderstood but that is not correct .
negative	in no way do i think customer service lied but they did make a mistake .
negative	it should not cost me to fix their mistake .
negative	that is a poor way to run a business .
negative	don_'_t order from any company that you can '_t call about your order .
negative	email reply is terrible , need to talk to live operator .
negative	i have already sent better_bathrooms an_email regarding a totally_unacceptable delivery service or lack of it i received . i think having over £ 0000 worth of stock i purchased dumped i my driveway even after getting a phone_call asking what time suited for delivery unbeleavable . to make_matters worse it was raining and everything had got soaked .
negative	i hope better_bathrooms review my email .
negative	well it takes too_long and then when its approved wheres the code ??
negative	to redeem
negative	the labels were not standard wine_bottle size , to small , perhaps beer_bottle but unusable for a wine_bottle .
negative	placed my order for 0 drontal tablets on 00 / 00 / 00 , checked 0 days_later and it still said processing , emailed customer_services who said item sent 00 / 00 / 00 but still no sign of order 00 / 00 / 00 .
negative	will never use this company again , order number 0000000
negative	this company does bad business .
negative	i accidentally ordered the wrong part and they will not let you cancel the order .
negative	i emails them hours after the order and they coincidently fails to respond until after the order shipped .
negative	so i got stuck with all the shipping cost .
negative	edited 0 / 0 / 0000 so now 00 days_later i finally received my money after an_email sent from this joke stating that not only were they going to refund all my money , but there would be no wire fee .
negative	well once again they lied .
negative	not only did they charge me , they charged me more then they said they would .
negative	i was charged over $_00 and have received much less then my intitial investment , even_though silver has gove up since i bought / if you deal with this company you are an_idiot and you will be robbed and don " t say i didn " t warn you !.
negative	for the idiots that do , please come_back here and read this !
negative	!
negative	i told you so !!
negative	!
negative	_______________________________________________
negative	edited 0 / 0 / 0000 well to support the truth of my review and the lying of their reply , bullionvault has still not sent me my money back .
negative	they claim i didn_'_t wire the money when i did and now when i want my money back , which they clearly state on their site , is wired back to your account , i still do not have my money and they no_longer reply to any contact i make .
negative	so not they are clearly ripping me off and because they are in the uk , there is nothing i can do .
negative	please do you research on this company and you will find i am not alone .
negative	also why are they now posting about peoples concerns that they are not a us company ?
negative	oh and why aren_'_t they replying here , in response to my allegations ?
negative	______________________________________________________
negative	edited 0 / 00 / 0000 .
negative	please read the comments to bullionvaults response and my response to them at the bottom of this review !
negative	this company does not operate in the us and therefore you have no legal_action available when they screw you over !
negative	______________________________________________________
negative	original review .
negative	i would love to know where to find any research , because i have searched the net and found nothing , with the exception of places like this , where people make reviews based on hearsay .
negative	lesson_learned !
negative	no reviews is just as good as no reviews , because like anything_else , trust needs to be earned !
negative	i registered for this site using my real name and email address , to give validity to my experience .
negative	i have had an account with this " business " for three months now .
negative	in this time i have wired money three_times .
negative	now when i say wired , i mean wired , so please do not question how the money was sent like their extremely unprofessional , so called " representatives " have every time this situation has occurred .
negative	wired has one definition .
negative	the sender goes to their bank in person , pays a fee to wire money directly from the senders account into another account .
negative	this takes no_longer then 00_hours and today , with computers and any quality bank , takes as little as an_hour .
negative	since the bank you are required to wire money to is bank of america , i seriously doubt the problem is the banks fault .
negative	when money is wired , it posts immedietely to the senders account so please do not ask when the money posted to my account .
negative	in all three situations , it has taken a minimum of 0 business days for the money to be deposited_into my bullionvault account .
negative	in the last situation , the money was wired on 0 / 0 / 0000 and the last reply i received from this company was that they would deal with it on monday .
negative	how convenient when the price of all the metals they deal in have risen dramatically .
negative	in every situation i have gotten the absolute most unprofessional responses from their “ staff ”( i can '_t even refer to them as “ customer service ”).
negative	they treat you like you are a child , they do nothing but give you the run around and they love to delay things further by taking_advantage of the time zone difference_between the us and the uk , where they actually operate .
negative	the fact that they operate in the uk is the primary reason_why you should not deal with this company and should only deal with a us company .
negative	like others , i have not had any_problems once they actually acknowledge that they have your money , but having delays on every deposit , with no acceptable explanation except to blame it on the banks , when this problem never occurs with a us company , is a clear sign that this is not an uncommon practice .
negative	seeing just one other person having the same problem is enough for me to also say that this is not uncommon .
negative	i strongly_recommend that you avoid this company at all costs .
negative	when it comes down to it , there are no advantages to dealing_with a company such as this and there are plenty of disadvantages .
negative	when it comes to investing your hard_earned dollars and you do not find any reviews positive or negative , be very very cautious as no good news should be assumed to be good news .
negative	when it comes to a company that doesn_'_t even operate in the us where our laws protect us , i would recommend not using them at all , because there are many companies like these that take_advantage of the trust we americans have in the laws that protect us here in the us that don_'_t elsewhere .
negative	if you are a metal investor to avoid what may happen if a system fails , then i would not trust this company because if a system failed , their system would definitely fail and the money you invested to protect yourself will be gone !
negative	( for you anyway )"
negative	_______________________________________________________
negative	response to bullionvaults first reply ;
negative	this reply is a lie !
negative	i have the emails and even receipts from this lame company that prove it and i would be glad to email any eveidence one may want to prove it .
negative	today is friday 0 / 00 / 0000 .
negative	in an_email from them on 0 / 00 / 0000 they sent me a copy of a receipt showing they received the money on 0 / 00 / 0000 .
negative	they also stated in the email that they would wire the money right back into my account and since it is 0 : 00_pm eastern time on friday , the soonest i may see my money is monday 0 / 00 / 0000 making a total of 00 days that i have had no control of my money !
negative	hey bullionvault , please post your lame_excuse as to why it is taking so long to wire the money back to me and why i have had no control over my money and why you are claiming to have not gotten the money until 0 / 00 / 0000 when the receipt you sent me which i attached says it was received on 0 / 00 / 0000 .
negative	should we start a separate website so i can post all of the evidence and emails replies you have sent me ?
negative	i have attached the receipt you sent me for everyone " s own judgement .
negative	why don_'_t you explain_why you also sent me the attached receipt from lloyd " s bank showing it was received on the date you claim , 0 / 00 / 0000 , when the money wasn_'_t even sent to lloyd '_s , it was sent to bank of america where your website gives the account info to send it to ?
negative	?
negative	the attachments were attached in the comments which has a link above their reply .
negative	i ordered here a couple of times & both_times i received wrong items plus i had to pay shipping & handling to send parts back when it wasn_'_t even my fault ...
negative	i think it '_s ridicules & i won_'_t be shopping here ever again cause i gotta worry if im receiving the right part & paying shipping to return it .
negative	oh also there is no # to contact them either , u gots to send email then wait !?
negative	!
negative	my part was delivered by ups broken , in my opinion it was not
negative	packaged very well
negative	i ordered a side_mirror , thought i was getting a great deal just found out part was broken and box was open .
negative	shipping company is investigating damage .
negative	picked_up after 0 days , rebooked 0 times , had very upset client .
negative	if it '_s reliability you need stay_away from this lot .
negative	i can not write this note as if i am speaking to a friend because you have violated my trust in your agency .
negative	i ordered and i paid you to ship to me a sunroof switch for a 0000_bmw , and what you sent to me was a sunroof switch for a mitsubish .
negative	the part number that i ordered was : w0000_- 0000000 .
negative	your shipping receipt indicated that you were shipping part number : w0000_- 0000000 .
negative	this part was not received .
negative	also , it is very frustrating not to be able to phone and speak to a service represent in a more timely_manner , and to have to rely_upon your receipt and reply to an electronic message , and your reply , does not address the matter that has_been brought to your attention .
negative	please provide part return instructions and please mail to me the correct part that i have paid you for .
negative	currently i am totally dis - satisfied with your provided service .
negative	how can an agency such as you not have phone contact services ????
negative	this is a very negative implication .
negative	do not buy from these idiots000
negative	bad part .
negative	they sent us a head_light which could not be alligned .
negative	the lights worked .
negative	i tried to book our reservation directly through the hotel company that we were going to stay with .
negative	there was not a single place that is said this booking was through expedia !
negative	they were misleading and when i tried to change reservations , i was unable to because it was through expedia !
negative	beware !!!
negative	!
negative	never rent a car from dollar la depot in your life
negative	i order a part with all the information you guys need and you send the wrong part and now you want me to pay to return it .
negative	so what i want now is the exact part that i should of gotten in the first place without_any charge .
negative	this is my order number 00 - 0000000 and ticket ## 000000
negative	i am still_waiting for a refund from paypal .
negative	you lost all my registration info .
negative	i booked my room myself with the hotel .
negative	i try to be fair when writing reviews - one star is fair .
negative	i bought an office_chair .
negative	first , my order got lost ... a week after i placed the order i called , and customer service saw that it hadn_'_t been shipped yet .
negative	then , they sent me six chairs on accident .
negative	a customer service rep named noah called to ask if i wanted to buy the remaining chairs or ship them back ... whaaat ?
negative	it '_s not my fault they shipped extra cases , now they are just lying here and i don_'_t know what to do with them .
negative	the group started out good but fall flat on their face .
negative	no email with confirmation number or receipt .
negative	when called , they could not send me my receipt and told me to call the hotel .
negative	the hotel stated it would come from the place i made my reservation with .
negative	what a circle jerk !
negative	well ordered a dipstick for my 0000_trailblazer [ chevy ] because my had broken off a few_years back [ 0 ] kept putting off buying one , finally went on line to buy something else , order it came in thinking people who sell parts would know what they were doing and the fact i didn_'_t have old one to compare it to just slid it down the tube and tried to pull it out to check fluid level .
negative	guess what it won_'_t come out and wont seal up tube so now drit and water can get in my trans !!
negative	!
negative	when i booked on line the right dates were put in and when the itinery came up as booked it came up 0 days_later .
negative	i called travelocity right_away and was told that a change was made but my price for the booking was almost 00 . 00 more .
negative	i enquired why and was told that i made a change .
negative	to me , it wasn_'_t a change , it was a correction for a problem that they made !
negative	makes me wonder ........... did they delibertly make this mistake so that they could make more money , ie .
negative	$_00 . 00 x 0000 customers equal ??
negative	?
negative	my order for a glider wing dolly was in october_0000 for £_000 and a delivery of about 0 days .
negative	this has still not arrived .
negative	initially there were reasons and ways ahead given and i was tolerant and understanding .
negative	as time progressed responses became less and less and now emails and answer machine messages asking for contact or refund are generally ignored .
negative	not being_able to talk to anyone any more leaves few options for me .
negative	probably my worst retail experience ever .
negative	i spent over £_000 with better_bathrooms and i had to return a pan and soft close lid and seat . the staff there do not reply to any email you send them .
negative	also when you do get to speak to them on the phone they say one thing to you over the phone and do nothing to help with the item in question .
negative	i would never use better bath room ever again .
negative	stay_away from this internet bathroom seller if you know whats good for you .
negative	i made the reservation for an employee of mine obviously a different name the guy was so rude i couldn_'_t believe it .
negative	never had someone so slow and unhelpful over the phone in a long time .
negative	decided to use a different hotel chain when i needed to book mr . diaz another room for a different location later in the day .
negative	be warned .
negative	ive bought many small items from this company which is normally okay .
negative	however i needed a tuner for my ecm this time around .
negative	the first arrived broken and the replacement screwed_up my bike .
negative	when i sent it off to return i was then hassled by having to contact the manufacturer of the product for a return_authorization_number that was then sent off to denniskirk ( im soo happy i could do their job for them ).
negative	it has_been 0_weeks since i returned the item and still have not received a refund .
negative	ive dealt_with their slow and incredibly rude customer service for weeks now with the same answer " we have to wait for the manufacturer ".
negative	the no_hassle return_policy is bs when it comes to electronics .
negative	they have essentially stolen my money and not even returned the defective piece of junk they sold me .
negative	ive had to buy another item from a different company to get my bike up and running since this has taken so long .
negative	i will never do_business with denniskirk . com again .
negative	arrival procedure has changed since my last trip to stansted and the instructions from our " uniformed " driver were sketchy and required 0 calls .
negative	on return our car had not been valeted for which i had paid £_00 including parking .
negative	i was told this was due to the weather .
negative	which may be true as it was cold .
negative	however it again took two calls to get my car delivered which involved us waiting in the said cold and when the car arrived with again a " non uniformed " driver i was offered £_00 for the lack of valet !
negative	we were given some water which the guy appeared quite pleased about
negative	rubbish service .
negative	i will avoid in future
negative	did not receive correct item as it was described on the website .
negative	it was said that i was promised an exchange only to be told later that i was wrong and that the website had described the item i received correctly and was them given a refund after instead of an exchange .
negative	poor services !
negative	!
negative	bought a living_room cabinet from very - when opened the mirrored backing was broken .
negative	i wasn_'_t too bothered as i recognise that accidents happen and it looked as if it has_been dropped in transit as the corner of the packaging was dented .
negative	i expected that a company the size of very was big enough that it would be a smooth_transition of simply replacing the broken part or replacing the whole cabinet .
negative	i have heard every excuse under the sun - but its down to the third_party supplier they use or the courier - i don_'_t care who is causing the delays , i bought the cabinet from very and therefore consider the contract to be with them , making it their issue to fix .
negative	in the meantime after a month we are still sitting with the huge packaging in the middle of our living_room floor while we wait for very to come up with another reason for not collecting it and / or replacing it .
negative	on the basis of after sales service i certainly would not recommend .
negative	i '_m still_waiting .
negative	it '_s been 00 days .
negative	parts_geek erroneously listed oe replacement wipers for my 0000_subaru tribeca ltd which i ordered and promptly received .
negative	they are not the correct wipers and do not fit my vehicle .
negative	to date they have refused to reimburse me the shipping_charges to my address even_though the error was theirs .
negative	in addition , i incurred return shipping_charges which brings the total over $_00 . 00 for shipping .
negative	i was informed they do not reimburse shipping so i requested the opportunity to speak with a supervisor but have not had a response .
negative	i can accept an error but not the poor customer service or unwillingness to take any responsibility for same .
negative	i ordered valentine '_s day flowers for my girlfriend in oxford .
negative	but arenaflowers did not deliver on feb 00 .
negative	i called the customer service trying to cancel my order but the woman answering the phone was in really bad attitude .
negative	i was trying to explain my reason to cancel the order , but she kept saying it was my fault as i tried to change the delivery address on valentine '_s day ( my girlfriend has another address which is easier to deliver ).
negative	i specifically left my girlfriend '_s phone_number for them to call in case any problem with the delivery but they never even try to contact us .
negative	i have already filed a formal consumer complaint with oft .
negative	you spend $_00 extra for overnight shipping and it comes 0 days_later ?!?!?!
negative	never will use fedex ever again ...
negative	terrible customer service .
negative	very long wait time .
negative	i did a search online and found this company rushmypassport . com .
negative	i completed the online form and made the payment .
negative	( this was a long holiday_weekend ).
negative	when i was in the process of gathering the paperwork required i realized that i didnt need this service from rushmypassport . com .
negative	i could go to a local county office or the local state_department office and i would get the passport the same date this company promised without the additional_fees and extra work .
negative	so i asked for a refund .
negative	note that at this point i had not sent them any info / paperwork , i just filled the initial form online with basic info .
negative	so there is not much passport processing they could have done .
negative	they initially agreed to give me my refund but said i had to contact their accounting_department , i contacted their accounting_department and asked for the refund .
negative	they said now i had to fill_out an_additional form that was going to be sent via_email to request the refund .
negative	this is fishy at best , a form to request a refund ?
negative	i had already sent them an_email_requesting the refund !
negative	that email ended_up going to my spam_folder and i didnt notice it until after i called them back and they confirmed who was the sender of such email .
negative	this was about 0_weeks after the initial payment i made .
negative	i completed the form and they refused to refund all my money !
negative	they decided to keep about 00_% of the fee because of their work on this case .
negative	they didnt do any work , i didnt send any paperwork .
negative	i do not recommend this company .
negative	the service they provide is something one can do by going to a government office for a much_lower price and less headaches .
negative	we ordered some hockey_shoes for my wife and a stick and bag for my nephew as a present .
negative	firstly we had no comms for 0 week and no delivery .
negative	i emailed and requested progress .
negative	told there was a prob with shoes , do we want a different size ?
negative	hello !!
negative	why would we want to wear sports shoes too big .
negative	then the story was changed to there was a problem with the stick .
negative	eventually after a string of emails that they seemed to forget what they had said in previous mail .
negative	we asked to cancel order and have money back .
negative	we were told the money would be with us by the end of the following week . strange !
negative	why so long ?
negative	finally we contacted visa and they said that they would reimburse us . 0_weeks after we should have got the money from hockey direct they contacted us to say they had made the payment .
negative	i don_'_t know if this was pressure from visa or just late and poor customer service .
negative	never again and i have warned all our hockey colleagues to stay well clear .
negative	this wasn_'_t worth the money .
negative	the ac only worked when it wanted too and the be was horribly uncomfortable .
negative	there was trash in the hallway when we arrived and when we left the next_day .... the trash was still there !
negative	it has_been three_weeks since i ordered my moded controller ( ordered 00 / 00 / 0000 ) and it still_hasn_'_t shipped .
negative	i have had no communication about the reasons_why this is taking so long .
negative	i ordered this for my son '_s christmas and they told me that everyone was upgraded to priority shipping .
negative	upon my last login to their website ( 00 / 00 / 0000 ) it still shows it hasn_'_t shipped .
negative	with the lack of communication on their end , it '_s hard to say why this is taking so long .
negative	to their credit , i ordered a mod last_year and received it promptly .
negative	i don_'_t understand_why they dropped the ball this year .
negative	their website says it could take 00 - 00 days to ship .
negative	i am now in my fourth week of waiting and with no response from gamermod .
negative	very disappointed !!
negative	!
negative	i am not at all pleased with the service i '_ve received .
negative	my part has still not arrived , or even left the warehouse according to ups , more than 0 days after i ordered it .
negative	and since there is no way to just call and talk to a customer service rep i emailed , and now have been waiting three_days with no response .
negative	i will not recommend partsgeek to friends and will not use their website either .
negative	i ordered a denso radiator for my toyota_tundra .
negative	great price .
negative	order was confimed , payment was confirmed .
negative	after 0 days and no radiator , i checked my order status on the web_site and noticed it was cancelled .
negative	i sent an_email to the customer department to confirm this status since i did not receive any notice .
negative	i have yet to receive any confirmation back from the company .
negative	one thing i did receive was a request to share my opinion .
negative	so here it is .
negative	refused to refund me after the shimano 000 chain that i purchased from them broke within 0 miles .
negative	hid behind shimano '_s reluctance to view it as a warranty claim .
negative	despite spending nearly_£_000 in total with them and my consumer_rights , obviously keeping me as a customer isn_'_t important to them .
negative	despite their low_prices , will never use them again
negative	took my money and ran .
negative	i want a full_refund , i ordered since halloween and still never got it .
negative	i think their website is coming_back up too .
negative	they sent the wrong items .
negative	they would not send replacements until i paid for them and then offered to credit me after returns were received i gave in and ten days_later i have no replacements .
negative	bad_experience overall .
negative	two_weeks to get frames which didn_'_t fit .
negative	then a restocking_fee deducted from refund !
negative	have these_people heard of zappos ?
negative	?
negative	this place is shady , terrible , and i will never park here again .
negative	i parked here for 0 days and upon my return on sunday , i noticed that one of my tires was different .. i have 0 continental pro tires that i recently_purchased and when i picked_up my car , one of my tires was replaced with some used piece of crap .. none of the employees had any answers for me and i was told to call the manager the next_day after filling_out an incident report ... i have no_idea what happened here .. they either stole my tire , or somehow flattened it and tried to replace it with some crappy tire hoping i wouldn_'_t notice .. i will never ever ever use this parking_lot again .. on top of that , the shuttle takes_forever to pick you up from the terminal and there were three drivers in the shuttle talking_about raves and doing drugs .. this place is as ghetto as they come ..
negative	twice covent_garden fx have been unable to fulfil my order and wasted my time .
negative	they are amateurs with scant regard for customer service , falling back on an , ' it aint my fault gov ' nor ' attitude .
negative	the web_site says the shop opens at 00 . 00 but you '_ll be lucky if the doors open much before a quarter past nine as " they ' re in the cafe ."
negative	if you value service and reliability , my advice is take their rate and see if a competitor will match it !
negative	no warning of roadworks which caused great difficulties .
negative	at 0 . 00pm in morning we finished in wrong car_park which we hadn_'_t realised until our return .
negative	this cost us an extra £_00 in order to retrieve our car .
negative	you have been warned !
negative	i paid for new parts and you sent me a use part greasey and dirty i tried to call you could not get in touch with and i think that was wrong
negative	cannot get their parts right .
negative	cannot even get their credit_card details right .
negative	not a clue ...
negative	i was sent the wrong part .
negative	the part sticker was correct but the part was the wong part .
negative	i have to pay return shipping for an error partsgeek made .
negative	ordered a package of radio_knobs for my 00 - yr_old daughters first vehicle since she had a couple missing .
negative	the website showed clearly that the package came with a volume knob , a tuning knob and four small knobs for fade , balance , treble and bass , exactly_what my daughters truck needed .
negative	when they cam in the mail the package had a volume knob , a tuning knob and only one of the smaller knobs .
negative	when i went back to the website to find a customer service line to call , none was to be found of course .
negative	i start to become irraitated already as i don_'_t like to deal with email complaints or reqests when you feel you have been mislead or even ripped_off .
negative	i want to immediately reach a human_being that can fix the issue .
negative	when i send an_email about my problem i get an out response saying it will be 0 to 0 business days before someone gets back to me , by email of course .
negative	a day or so later i get the first email response from partsgeek that simply states that " the knobs that i ordered only come with 0 knobs ".
negative	now i '_m furious b /_c that did nothing to satisfy my issue .
negative	so , i have to email again stating that the picture clearly shows on the website 0 total knobs ( the 0 larger ones and the four small ones ) and i include my phone_number and request that a service rep call me .
negative	a day or two later i get my second email response acknowledging the errent picture on the website and offering to refund my money with no " restocking " fees or i could by yet another knob package and they would waive the shipping .
negative	they also stated to send my phone_number so they could call me !!
negative	hello ???
negative	i did send my phone_number , damn it !!
negative	so i angerly sent a third email over a weeks timeframe sending my phone_number again .
negative	it has_been more than 0 business days now since my third email and i have yet to receive a third email response or single phone_call .
negative	horrible customer service , blatantly misleading pictures on website .
negative	totally_unacceptable !
negative	!
negative	it will take a very long time to overcome the bad feeling created by boilerjuice price gauging in the winter before last .
negative	i only use the service infrequently now whereas it had become my preferred choice previously .
negative	boilerjuice needs to make a john_lewis type no_quibbles price promise , as a minimum to regain trust .
negative	also , stop insulting me with offers of rubbish wine that should be used as fuel .
negative	servers are down every month and support does not help .
negative	we lose 00_hrs / month to convince them what is wrong
negative	i purchased a 0 month_xbox_live code , received it digitally within 00_minutes , and it was shown as invalid when i first attempted to redeem the code .
negative	all characters were entered correctly .
negative	i rented a small van for use in a recent tuscany trip .
negative	the website showed a mercedes viera which would have been perfect .
negative	the price i paid reflected a mercedes .
negative	when i checked in as indicated , there was no mercedes until the next_day -- so i got the renault .
negative	it worked_fine but i paid a mercedes price .
negative	the renault was very basic -- no features -- four tires , an engine , bench seats and a ride like a truck .
negative	at the right price , a workable vehicle .
negative	i had a five day rental and i think i paid a weekly rate .
negative	i returned the vehicle about 0 hours after i had scheduled and was billed an_additional $_000 .
negative	auto_europe will not get my business again .
negative	flight was canceled .
negative	called to rebook , they couldn_'_t figure it out .
negative	told me to call delta directly .
negative	i did .
negative	they worked it out great .
negative	travelocity , however , kept sending me emails with different itineraries , often with multiple flight segments that were duplicated .
negative	eventually , i just started deleting any email i received from travelocity , and went with what i worked out directly with delta .
negative	calling travelocity costumer service is a complete_waste of time and effort .
negative	the part ( an air_filter ) did not fit .
negative	the rubber ( probably neoprene ) gasket was too thick , and i could not close that canister that holds the filter .
negative	i finally trimmed quite a bit of the rubber off , and was able to close the housing ,
negative	if it had been a more_expensive part , i would '_ve returned it .
negative	as it is , i '_m just going to use it til i get the right filter .
negative	second problem with justeat .
negative	placed an order .
negative	accepted .
negative	then refused .
negative	still don_'_t have my cash back .
negative	what else is there to say ?
negative	!
negative	as mentioned in the title , it '_s never their fault .
negative	they can '_t actually rectify problems either .
negative	the general response is something along the lines of " tough , deal with it ".
negative	read other reviews ...
negative	same nonsense .
negative	reply :
negative	i have already called .
negative	the manager can '_t do anything .
negative	it '_s the bank '_s fault that justeat accepted an order , changed their mind , and i don_'_t have my cash apparently .
negative	if it isn_'_t back in my account on monday , i have to chase it up with the bank !
negative	really !?
negative	here '_s an idea ... don_'_t take money if you can '_t deliver !!!!
negative	is that so hard ?!
negative	and cut the insincere " sorry " nonsense .
negative	that '_s all people get from justeat .
negative	hows about some actual resolutions ?
negative	the fact of the matter is justeat has chosen a system of refund that is inadequate .
negative	possibly non_- existent .
negative	i can transfer_money instantly .
negative	so can justeat .
negative	they chose to conduct their business in that manner .
negative	well , i will chose to go elsewhere .
negative	ripoff ...$ 00 hidden activation_fee on itunes_card
negative	i had one late payment , though i had informed them well in advance and they agreed to it .
negative	however when the day came for me to make my payment i noticed the payment_options were not available ( either server down or they just disable them in late payments , why ?
negative	you would have to ignore common_sense to understand ).
negative	so after emailing them saying payment is ready and receiving no reply my server was shut_down the very next_day .
negative	so i went to their live_chat , made the payment only to hear " our sync server is undergoing maintenance and it should be 0 - 0 hours ."
negative	this made me a little angry as i am a web_developer and have work to do and i need a live environment to properly test ( http request times and such ).
negative	so after waiting the 0 - 0 hours ..... nothing .
negative	thinking something might of went wrong on boot i initialize a restart through their system .
negative	then about an_hour later ...... nothing .
negative	at this point im kinda ticked so i email them and get a somewhat fast reply saying i just initiated restart 0 mins ago ( um over an_hour ) and am asked to wait .
negative	so because its late i go to bed , wake_up and ........ nothing .
negative	at this point we start an_email battle them asking dumb questions that have nothing to do with it and me replying with all they ask , the whole_process takes a week before they finally figure_out " oh it just needs to be rebooted " ( it was already rebooted twice and the mtr showed their router down ).
negative	so i finally get my server back after a week ( not being_able to test my code as well ) and i proceed to demand a free month due to it being on their end this all happened .
negative	they proceed to say that i failed to use the ticket system properly and replied to them late ( its my time not theirs , i am the customer , that and we are across the world they reply while i sleep and take 0 days sometimes themselves ).
negative	so in the end i told them i am going to write this review and that they can cancel my services for next month ( if they say anything about that or try to charge me there is gonna be hell to pay ).
negative	after calling for three_weeks with no answer went online and twice pulled the so call problem tickets , still to this day waiting ... the only reason i bought from them was because the original order was missing these parts but do not recommend to my worst_enemy .... ughh bad_experience
negative	0_stars was not an option .
negative	i paid for a $_000 phone , plus express shipping to replace a phone i had lost in an_emergency .
negative	after waiting 0 days with the charge " preauthorized " on their books ( effectively freezing the money in my account without taking it ), they notified me that the item i had requested wasn_'_t even in stock .
negative	after electing a replacement , they still took an_additional three_days to authorize the charge and ship .
negative	unacceptable for an express delivery selection .
negative	after receiving the phone 00 days after order , i set it up .
negative	less_than 0 days_later , the battery began failing / not accepting a charge .
negative	i brought this to the company '_s attention and expressed extreme dissatisfaction .
negative	they referred me to request an_rma refund .
negative	however , the 00 day period had already passed .
negative	i could only get the phone 00 days after my order .
negative	i had 0 days to verify the phone was working .
negative	in less_than 0 days , it was not .
negative	and they referred me to a return_policy that is no_longer available due to extremely slow service that i paid to expedite .
negative	never shopping here again , and will do my best to make it worth their time to fix this disaster of an experience in broadcasting this everywhere possible .
negative	not the right part , unable to return because of partsgeek policy .
negative	i ordered a bath on the weekend and phoned the branch on monday to ask for a phone_call off the delivery driver so i could get time off to meet for delivery
negative	the person_who took my call told me that this was not possible as a courier firm was used and a 0 hour time_slot was the best they could give me
negative	she then went on to tell me that if i was not there at the correct time i would incur another delivery charge
negative	very very poor telephone skills
negative	horrible , i never got my package .
negative	your delivery option should be ups or fed_x .
negative	i wrote the following email to customer_support .
negative	please read !
negative	any help you can be to me would be appreciated :
negative	dear_sir or madam ,
negative	i cannot " return " the side_view_mirror without making my vehicle " illegal ' to drive .
negative	i paid the full purchase price and i was short changed .
negative	i didn_'_t do anything wrong , and yet i have to suffer .
negative	i want a better solution .
negative	send me another new side_view_mirror with " all " the parts that i have already paid for .
negative	you guys are quick to collect your money upfront , but you have no compassion on the poor people who have to live with your mistakes ,.
negative	when you send me ( at your expense ) the complete part , with nothing missing , i can then install it on the vehicle .
negative	then , i can return the defective product .
negative	if this matter does not get resolved , i will have no choice , but to not only discontinue using your service , but i will tell_everyone i know about my dissatisfaction .
negative	and , i have a lot of facebook friends .
negative	glenn fratto
negative	geeks that '_s right !
negative	they are a bunch of losers .
negative	they sent me the wrong part .
negative	i tried_calling they don_'_t answer the phone ever .
negative	so i can rereturn part .
negative	i filled_out their stupid ticket 0 times and they never get back to me .
negative	even if you return part you have to pay for shipping and their is 00_percent restocking_fee .
negative	what a bunch of morrons .
negative	first and last time i get anything from god dam internet .
negative	i ' d rather pay a little more and go to an auto_parts store .
negative	i '_m going to tell all my family and friends so they don_'_t ever buy their ever
negative	as an orbitz - owned company , i thought that cheaptickets would be a trustworthy site to book through .
negative	however , that was far from the case .
negative	we had to cancel a flight and reschedule our trip due to a medical emergency .
negative	we spent about 0 hours ( not an exaggeration ) on the phone trying to process this request .
negative	we were disconnected about six times and each time we called back there was at_least a 00min wait time .
negative	they do not give out direct phone numbers so that you can reconnect with the customer service person with whom you were speaking .
negative	i requested after the first disconnection that they call the number on file , confirmed to be correct , if we were disconnected .
negative	they never called back .
negative	not once when disconnected six times .
negative	each person we spoke to provided us with contradicting information and fee amounts .
negative	being lied to is not acceptable .
negative	they were unsuccessful with scheduling our hotel stay in time and we were charged the full_amount with no refund by the hotel .
negative	luckily , we purchased trip insurance , but cheaptickets was completely_useless in helping_us with out situation .
negative	they also could not provide the fee amounts ( their own fees !)
negative	that we would be charged for cancellation .
negative	we were told that we had to deal with the insurance company even_though they had our full itinerary and it was their fees that we were asking about .
negative	stay_away and book through the airline and hotel_directly or find a site you know you can trust .
negative	did not recieve a shipping confirmation_email nor did i recieve the part i ordered .
negative	opened a support_ticket and customer service has still not responded back
negative	i am very disappointed in this online company do to the fact that you guys had extremely rude service on the phone and .
negative	that you guys lost my order spent over 000 $ got nothing at all yet order was suppose to arrive on
negative	0 / 00 / 00 and here it is 0 / 00 / 00 still no order are you guys ever gonna send it .
negative	why is it so hard to ship something to a paying customer apparently you guys cheated me out of my money .
negative	and not given me what i paid for and have missed several rugby games and practices do to the fact that you guys lost my order i risk being_able to play for a high end team because of the simple fact that you guys can '_t complete my transaction i paid for .
negative	so to all reading the reviews don_'_t ever buy off here anymore it '_s the worst service ever .
negative	more like worldsworstrugbyshop that lies and steals from you .
negative	when i originally placed my order i requested it shipped to another address .
negative	the next_day i received an_email_stating my order was on hold because they wouldn_'_t ship it to another address .
negative	why wasn_'_t this stated when i placed the order ?
negative	not a very good way to do_business .
negative	i didn_'_t have the time to contact my credit_card company to get there approval .
negative	i therefore placed my order with another company who had no problem shipping it to another address .
negative	therefore i will not be placing any other orders with this ompany .
negative	the pillowcompany is a very frustrating company to work with .
negative	once you hand them your money .
negative	you won_'_t hear_anything back from them .
negative	you will recieve an order number , however no way to check the status of the order or an estimate of when the product will be shipped .
negative	you will also never recieve a ups_tracking_number .
negative	contact customer_support ?
negative	don_'_t expect a response .
negative	the item did arrive .... more than 0_weeks after order .
negative	i will not purchase from this company again , nor will i advise others from doing so as well . the length of time to get the pillow to me was not of ups '_s doing , but the pillowcompany .
negative	ups had no hold ups in getting the product to me .
negative	the complete order was wrong .
negative	mirrors were to small .
negative	order rear tailght receive front headlight_assembly needed rear .
negative	lost funds !
negative	would not recommend
negative	i was quoted £_000 for my samsung_galaxy_s0 about a week_ago .
negative	i have sent it to them and just like everyone_else , this mythical " excessive wear and tear " has reduced the price of my phone to £_00 .
negative	obviously this is unacceptable and in no way am i paying the £ 0 . 00 to have it returned .
negative	i will spend all day on the phone to customer service if i have too and after i get my money i will be contacting every watchdog there possibly is .
negative	i hope people read these stories in the future , i wish i had before i used these fraudsters !
negative	i ordered 0 new cv_axles 0 seals new tailgate hinges and 0 tie_rod ends .
negative	i recieved the hinges tie_rod ends and seals on time .
negative	after a week of not recieving my axles i contacted cs and opened up a ticket and they sent an_email_saying theyll get back to me in 00 - 00_hours and they never did .
negative	finally a week after i was supossed to recieve my axle one arrived at my doorstep and the box it was in had a fork lift fork puncture throught it .
negative	it wasnt damaged but i '_m still_waiting on my 0nd axle !
negative	wont do buissness again !
negative	i will never buy from this company again & have no trouble telling all i know how i got screwed by " partsgeek " order #_000000 i would spend the time to tell you about my stupid horrible experience with partsgeek but i '_ll just sum it up to dont buy from partsgeek because they do not care about you .
negative	this must be a temporary " flash in the pan " business to take all they can & split .
negative	ordered rear passenger interior door_handle in black ..... got a brown right rear handle .
negative	first of all they charge you an extra seven bucks to so called activate the card then you find out that it is the same card they probably had in stock and are simply reselling it .
negative	when i was finally able to follow their instructions , that they told me in the emails i sent ; completely ignoring what i was saying , i get a message_saying their inbox is too full .
negative	they lucky to get the one star .
negative	they do not seem legit or sincere .
negative	from now on i am researching everyone before using their service .
negative	pc_game_supply should be shut_down .
negative	order part 0_weeks_ago was sent wrong part can '_t get_ahold of any human_being , was told i can purchas .
negative	e the same part i already purchased and they would credit back to me my money in up to 00 days .
negative	fool me once shame on you fool me twice shame on me .
negative	they have my money i don_'_t have my part .
negative	i '_ve done business with them in the past and it has_been good .
negative	will revisit this valuation after remedy to this current unbelievable situasion .
negative	if no immediate resolve , then i will_definitely never do_business again .
negative	i have the audacity to ask me to buy the part again !!!
negative	!
negative	i recently_purchased a radiator from partsgeek and after receiving it i installed it within a right a way upon getting it .
negative	right after installation and running the car for few miles i noticed that radiator is leaking from its body .
negative	i contacted the partsgeek to obtain a rma_# and i found out although the parts arrived defective that i '_m responsible for shipping it back .
negative	this is bunch of none sense .
negative	partsgeek should be replacing it wi0ht no additional ; cost to their customers .
negative	the part did not fit the car .
negative	very disappointed !
negative	!
negative	i paid you 00 bucks , and got very little for the honor
negative	these_people are mindless robots
negative	customer service is awful , sunglasses not delivered at all but go on the website and they are not discontinued .
negative	try to contact them service levels are 00_hours this is a poor respones time considring they state their an international company .
negative	i am not even waiting for them to repond now i will dispute the transaction with the bank would recommend people do the same because these_people do not respond .
negative	vd0000000000g .
negative	night before flight , united_airlines cancelled flight arranged via travelocity .
negative	could not get flight reconfirmed or timely help from travelocity in arranging new flight .
negative	non_- responsive to assist in getting refund from united or travelocity .
negative	similar prior experiences -- if something_goes_wrong with travel_plans arranged by travelocity , travelocity is not responsive to solving problems .
negative	recommend that anyone planning to use travelocity use other travel arranger .
negative	will not use again .
negative	and desire no more e_-_mails or contact of any kind from travelocity .
negative	so , far , i '_m not sure .
negative	they sent me a " finished " file which only contained approximately 00_minutes of a 0 hours 00_minutes file .
negative	i had no option but to collect from the depot ( dwp ) i think .
negative	i missed the delivery , i had asked to be texted an_hour before but didn_'_t get a text until two hrs after
negative	firstly the depot was really hard to find and on the email i got it , just asked for the delivery card ..
negative	i got up there to be told i needed a passport and proof of address .
negative	i was refused at first to be given my item and had to wait 0 / 0 of an_hour to speak to the manager , to get my goods which i eventually did , after much stress , rudeness from their staff , and wrangling .
negative	my advice to pdh_sports is change your delivery company - i would not buy from here again even if it was more_expensive to find someone_who used the good old royal_mail ..
negative	what can i say , they returned my car with the alarm going off , lost my immobiliser reset styles so i cannot reset alarm ,
negative	remote central locking is not working because of this .
negative	dealer says immobiliser reset styles is unique to alarm_system .
negative	no customer service , called to see if they could look for styles no return call although promised , called a further three_times nothing .
negative	read the terms they have a waver only responsible for key nothing else should be left on key ring .
negative	left me to foot the bill don_'_t know how much yet .
negative	would i use them again not on your life
negative	gave them one star although they were not rude .
negative	made purchase then unable to pay or contact , what is this site ??
negative	?

negative	not at any point was i told that i was speaking with expedia .
negative	i was under the assumption that i was speaking with the hotel that i had tried to call .
negative	i was booked and made reservations without ever being told that it was expedia .
negative	sorry my order never arrived lneed may mony for back
negative	windcheater of poor quality , zips were difficult to zip .
negative	very hard to return , cost me £ 0 to return faulty goods .
negative	tried to return in - store , but found that they would only exchange or give a credit note for in - store .
negative	i ordered a book for class but it was not delivered .
negative	i had to order it elsewhere and now it '_s late as my class has already started .
negative	school is tough enough without starting out behind .
negative	high prices and usual mass treat .

negative	will never buy another part from them ...
negative	i ordered 0 taillights for my truck and after almost 0_weeks i receive my order and i receive 0 taillight and a 00 cobalt headlight_assembly .... been trying to get in touch with someone for 0_weeks to straighten it out and no call .....
negative	i gave up finally
negative	i ordered a right and a left brake calliper the part numbers on the boxes were right but both boxes contained right brake callipers .
negative	i had to do a return and im still_waiting for the correct part
negative	was sent the wrong atomizer heads the where sold to me as vision atomizer heads but what was sent was some counterfeit rubbish that did not even fit inside my official vision clearomizer .
negative	customer service was appalling when i rang i was lied to and bombarded with irrelevant information to my issue .
negative	they advertise far more stock than they ever have in .
negative	awful avoid avoid avoid
negative	i ordered a cam positioning sensor on 0 / 00 .
negative	my credt card was charged on 0 / 00 .
negative	i still have not received the part .
negative	what is up with that ?
negative	parts_geek sucks
negative	i chose to purchase a hp multi function laser_printer from printware due to the price and free next_day delivery .
negative	after_placing my order i received an_email from them saying that the item ordered was actually out of stock and that they can either source it for me or cancel the order .
negative	as i needed the printer in a rush , i asked to cancel the order which the customer service rep confirmed quickly and also mentioned that the money would not be taken from my account .
negative	checking my bank balance the following_day i noticed that i was £_000 short and after_speaking with my bank , learned that they were waiting for a cancellation_notice from printware .
negative	i emailed and called printware to resolve the matter as i needed the money to be available to purchase the printer from another supplier .
negative	it is now 0 days since my initial order and i '_m still_waiting for the funds to be made available .
negative	i '_ve been told that i " should " have the money available early next week .
negative	printware failed on 0 levels here ; the first being that they did not update there website with stock availability , making visitors to there website believe that they have more than they actually have .
negative	the second being that even_though they did not take the money from my account , they have made it impossible for me to purchase the printer elsewhere due to a very slow transactions process .
negative	i guess my mother will have to wait for her_birthday_present this year .
negative	thanks printware , great job ( sarcasm ).

negative	agoda cancelled all my booked hotels which i booked couple weeks_ago the during my flight to vietnam .
negative	found out when i had to stop at san_fran .
negative	i panicked of course .
negative	my vacation was set and agoda ruined it .
negative	i didn_'_t realize agoda had the power to " hack " into my acct and on my behalf initiate the cancel transaction without my knowledge or approval .
negative	i will complain to them after m vacation as their number is in jolly old england .
negative	they will get an earful from me n i expect some sort of compensation from those idiots .
negative	already spread the word , none of my friends will be using agoda for vacation_planning .
negative	i called my bank and had e them monitor all transactions from them .
negative	i gave them all my personal information n credit info as well .
negative	i have little confidence in agoda and have fear of them since they have my personal info .
negative	people do not use use agoda , go to the other ones like expedia
negative	having ordered two keyboards , two keyboard stands and two_sets of headphones to complete a classroom suite of keyboards , i was somewhat dismayed to have the headphones and the keyboard stands arrive first with an_email_saying that the keyboards will be delayed .
negative	this is not a new experience for me using gak .
negative	on ordering a bass_guitar and amp bundle that was in stock , i received an_email_telling_me it would be delayed .
negative	this took weeks to arrive .
negative	on the whole , i will not be using gak again and wouldn_'_t recommend anyone_else to either .
negative	product was boxed incorrectly , the front_struts were in the rear_strut box .
negative	therefore these are not the boxes that they came in from monroe !
negative	they did not have the bolt and washers with them as well .
negative	i will never buy anything from you again and will tell anyone_who will listen the same thing .
negative	i '_m not even sure these are really monroe_shocks .
negative	when the product is delivered in mixed boxes that are not from the factory something is not right .
negative	shipping was very slow also .
negative	heading explains it pretty well , i '_m only a college_kid that loves jeeps and they screwed_up an order now i '_m unable purchase the item i wanted because i '_m on a tight
negative	budget .
negative	so thanks 0wd for screwing me over !
negative	it was great .
negative	search the fender , input with year ( 0000 ) and correct model , and the invoice and receipt describe the same information .
negative	when i received the item with the same item no ., but the label stick at the parts describe that is for 0000 - 0000 !
negative	that is definately big problem for the inventory management , not the responsibility of the buyer ........ but i have to pay for the return shipping cost , also 00_% restocking_fee !
negative	horrible experience .... how could i trust to buy the correct stuff from you !
negative	i bought a body part for my truck and paid $_00 . 00
negative	when the part arrived is was incorrect do to a catalog error on your part . i contacted you and was gived a rma_number to return
negative	ups charged me $_00 . 00 to ship the part back .
negative	when you received the part back you charged me a 00_percent restocking_fee $ 0 . 00 refunding me $_00 . 00 for a part i paid $_00 . 00 for a part you shipped me in error .
negative	my out of pocket_expense totaled $_00 . 00 .
negative	when i expressed my concern with your customer service dept they pritty much told me to get lost .
negative	i can not see you staying in business .
negative	when you treat_customers like dirt !
negative	just for the record i ordered and received the same part form another online seller and the part arrived corret and fit like a glove .
negative	wrong parts i have to wail over a week to send me a return receipt .
negative	nobody to talk to .
negative	you call stay on the line for hours and then hang_up on you .
negative	i have received this fan and have installed it .
negative	i had reliable electric ( jeff sharkey 000 - 000 - 0000 ) come out to connect the electricity .
negative	it is installed in a sun room as a replacement for a similar fan .
negative	the fan kept destroying the fuse .
negative	there is a short somewhere .
negative	i would not let him take the unit apart , it came completely together .
negative	.
negative	do you have someone in the area ( dayton ohio ) who could come to fix the problem ?
negative	it took me half a day to install the fan ; i would rather not replace it .
negative	below is the response to an_email i sent to the company from which i ordered the fan .
negative	thank_you !

negative	i ordered flowers for my girlfriend for valentines_day ( this was our first one together and she is in spain for study abroad ).
negative	i ordered them two_weeks in advance so they had plenty of time to set it up and i even gave them a number to call incase nobody was home when they tried to deliver the flowers .
negative	the day came and no flowers showed_up so i sent them a message asking why ( because their online service wasnt up for several days ).
negative	when they finally got back to me they claimed the flowers were delivered when i knew they hadnt been .
negative	i asked again and they didnt respond for several days so i had to get up throughout the night until i saw they were up and had them call the florist they had delegated the delivery to .
negative	they said the flowers were never delivered and iflorist apologized and sent the flowers that day .
negative	at this point i thought it was over but then i found out they sent the wrong flowers .
negative	i am tired of fighting with them over this so i have stopped going after them but i felt the need to warn everyone especially about their attempts to lie to me about the product .
negative	i would never suggest this place to anyone or ever use it again .
negative	the only positive was when i did get in contact with an actual person they were very nice
negative	can not get a hold of them after ordering .
negative	parts were shipped but never arrived even_though fedex said they were .
negative	have been unable to get in contact partsgeek to resovle issue .
negative	i worked with fedex in tracking package but after they couldn_'_t find them they told me to contact vendor .
negative	there is no phone to call and the on - line customer_support tickets don_'_t work i have put 0 in over 0 days and no one has contacted me .
negative	$_000 later with no parts and no signs if i will get my money or parts .
negative	although the website said there were 00 waterbutt taps in my local store , none could be found , by staff , when i arrived .
negative	ordered them online to collect - only to find they were different from those on the website .
negative	was told made call for three hours 00_minutes 00 seconds , said impossible was told thats it !
negative	!
negative	bought a book that was in high_demand , the price was very good .
negative	after order was made , and money taken from paypal , they cancelled my order saying . "
negative	item not available ".
negative	book was available on site but at a higher price !
negative	i sent email to customer service and they said there was nothing they could do .
negative	well i thought partsgeek was the greatest place ever to order parts .
negative	saved almost 000 bucks on first couple of orders .
negative	but then my last order has_gone straight to hell !
negative	ordered an ignition_coil for my 00 windstar .
negative	part shows up and the wife was getting happy cause she was going to get her van back .
negative	pulled it out of the box and set it next to the old one and guess what ?
negative	not the right part !!
negative	the shipping box had the right number written on it .
negative	the shipping paper had the right number on it .
negative	but the actual part box and part were wrong !!
negative	thought i was going to be saving around 00 dollars .
negative	but now that '_s not happening .
negative	had to go my local_auto store and paid 00 bucks for the right one .
negative	now i find out i '_m going to lose the money i paid for shipping and insurance .
negative	about 00 bucks .
negative	and i '_m responsible for the shipping and insurance to send it back .
negative	don_'_t know what that damage is yet !
negative	if i had ordered the wrong part i can see me losing money .
negative	but when your parts picker picks the wrong part and ships it ??
negative	i think its wrong to force the customer to eat the cost of your mistake !!!
negative	this was probably the last part i ordered ( shall i say tried to order ) from partsgeek .
negative	this is not how you treat your customers when you make a mistake !!
negative	not happy at all in ohio !
negative	!
negative	you guys suck balls !
negative	my order was completely wrong ( not even close ) and i '_ve tried_calling numerous_times and left many voicemails and emails and not one response from you at all !
negative	i '_m reporting you to the bbb and filing every claim i can against you .
negative	you guys are the biggest rip - off company out there !
negative	your lucky i '_m not in nj , but if i ever come that way , i will throw my wrong order in your face !!!
negative	you suck !
negative	ordered and paid for shoes they never arrived , phoned help line held on for almost one hour voice_message repeatedly said all our agents are busy we will answer shortly ............. well no one did answer .
negative	then sent e_-_mail got reply ' shoes out for delivery ' hmmm checked tracker said goods damaged returned to sender from courier depot .
negative	sent email_saying this , got reply got reply should get your parcel today what a joke !!
negative	hold them to cancel order and refund money was then told it would take 0_weeks to get my money back .
negative	hardly got an_apology , told them wont shop with again ecco will also advise my friends , also said it would be good if md or sales director knew what was going on ...................... guess what no reply .
negative	very dissatisfied customer
negative	bought the dewalt dc0pak v0 0 peice cordless kit , had for 00 or so days and was dissapointed from the start with the performance but felt it may improve with time , so after a the circular_saw failed to complete a simple task of cutting some 00mm fence_panels , i decided to ring my tool shed , emma the so called manager , basically told me the if the kit cant perform to the standard i expect then tough_luck , i would never buy from these again and hope they cease trading very soon
negative	bestilte to langærmede t - shirt som i følge hjemmesiden skulle_være 000_% bomuld .
negative	det viste_sig at de var 00_% bomuld og 0 % lycra .
negative	så skulle jeg have ulejlighed med at returnere dem_og_få handelen annulleret .
negative	aldrig mere .
negative	like i said before great parts and lots of then for a fair price .
negative	but not really sure about the shipping i '_m not completely sure if it was parts_geeks fault or ups who shipped the wrong part but the way of communication is terrible for parts_geek .
negative	the phone they never answer and the support_ticket takes to long and it makes it some what more difficult to explain and then you have to wait 00_hours then an e_-_mail that they are going to send you an_rma_number or something in another 00_hours that just to much waiting its unacceptable .
negative	i wanted to order some probiotics for around $_00 -$ 00 per bottle .
negative	they were out of stock on one , and the other needed $_00 + for shipping because it needed to be cool .
negative	i wnet to another web_page , puritan , and got 0 bottles , 000 capsules each for $_00 total with shipping .
negative	customer reviews looked good .
negative	let_me begin by saying that i '_m a regular customer of bp and generally think they ' re very good .
negative	but i bought the bcaa in response to an_email ( 00 july ) with two discount_codes .
negative	i was eligible for a free pack of multivitamins + 00_%_off the bcaa .
negative	but when the bcaa arrived there were no vitamins .
negative	i phoned bp customer service and spoke to [_name ].
negative	he was completely unapologetic and unhelpful , explaining ; ' you can only use one code per order - read the small_print on our website !'
negative	i observed that the email offer does not mention you can only use one code and the online booking does not make this clear either .
negative	[_name ] didn_'_t seem remotely bothered .
negative	bp products are good but be warned that their customer service does not match up !
negative	this company has the worst customer service i have ever_dealt_with in my life .
negative	i simply had to return a product that does not fit on my vehicle even_though their site says it does .
negative	upon requesting return_authorization , i received authorization for another part of my order , not the part i need to return .
negative	i emailed the company back and told them about their error , but not have heard from them for over a week .
negative	not having a phone_number on their website , i did a little digging on the internet and found one .
negative	when you call the number , which is correct , you will never get to talk to anyone because they are " experiencing_high call_volumes " ( wonder_why ).
negative	the recording just suggests going back to their website and filling_out a service ticket causing a reoccurring process .
negative	when ups came to my house , they said i had a c . o . d .
negative	for 00 dollars even when i had free shipping .
negative	i had paid the full_amount otherwise for the order .
negative	i wasn_'_t able to collect the package given that i had to be home to pay the extra 00 dollars .
negative	the shipment was automatically returned after the third try , and i have not received a refund after returning 00 days after purchase .
negative	i would be apprehensive to use them again !
negative	several phone_calls and e_-_mail went_unanswered .
negative	poor quality control received one part damaged and the other was a cheaper part in the more_expensive parts box .
negative	poor packaging and horrible phone system .
negative	i give them a - 00 rating
negative	groupon voucher von prentu ist ein betrug .
negative	nie wieder ...
negative	the worst possible purchase ever !!
negative	!
negative	not happy at all not with the service not with the way the glasses are packed and not even with the after care what a load of rubbish its my 0nd time buying and now i have 0 pairs of glasses sitting on the shef collecting_dust .
negative	i would not recomend selectspecs . com to my friends or family .
negative	its a big company that dosnt really care about there small and potentional customers
negative	i have tried to explain to customer servise that my glasses are bent or broken so they glue it back together and send it back , am i that stupid or what ???!!!
negative	the glue is visible its still bent i had to pay for postage .
negative	not like it says on the website if any problem the cost to send back they will pay .
negative	it is the worst based online company i have ever_delt_with
negative	i didn_'_t even bother complaining again it will just cost me mor time and money so i just accepted the fact that i had to loose that money but its a shame it went to them and not for a good charity cause or so ..
negative	please please please don_'_t bother
negative	many_thanks
negative	we were traveling with another couple to hawaii and wanted to all sit together .
negative	we booked our flights and picked our seats on this site so we could travel together .
negative	well ... when we checked in at the airport , our seats had been changed and we did not get to sit together .
negative	the airline said that travelocity should have notified us of the change prior to our flight , which didn_'_t happen .
negative	we were very disappointed !
negative	don_'_t know why we bothered picking seats when they were all changed without our knowledge .
negative	don_'_t offer this service if you can '_t provide it !!
negative	!
negative	i was not impressed they sent me the right box with the wrong item inside
negative	their customer service is very unorganized and i will never recommend them to anyone .
negative	they do not have a customer service number where a representative can be reached and their ticket system is ridiculous .
negative	their e_-_mail response time is also terrible , it takes them days to respond .
negative	if this is how that business is run the management needs to be fired , or the business shut_down .
negative	i don_'_t know how they have made it this long .
negative	when i tried to order a tea pack , it wouldn_'_t even let_me buy it .
negative	another weird thing was that they sent me a late apology email 0 months later after this happened .
negative	although their products are good , it takes them a long time to ship to my place .
negative	i don_'_t know if it '_s only just me , but i had to wait for more than 0 months for it to arrive .
negative	worst online place i ever shopped and i won_'_t be doing it again anytime_soon !
negative	they sent me the wrong sunglasses and it took me 00 (!!)
negative	emails and 0 . 0 months to get a refund since they couldn ´ t deliver the sunglasses i had ordered .
negative	this included that i had to arrange and pay for the return freight of the wrongly sent sunglasses and it took me some 0 - 0 emails to get a refund for the postage_costs .
negative	this is not a company , this is a joke !
negative	addition after reply from smartbuyglasses ; " vår kundtjänst gör allt de kan för_att lösa problemet på snabbast möjliga sätt ..... på_grund av höga mängder av e_-_mail just nu kan det inneburit lite längre väntetider ".
negative	when it takes 0 . 0 months to correct a wrong delivery , you cannot blaim on " a lot of emails at the moment " or claim that your customer_support " does everything they can to correct the issue asap ".
negative	these are lies from a fraud company !
negative	reading previous comments about smartbuyglasses demonstrates clearly that buying from them is a lottery ; if you are lucky you will get what you ordered in time , if not then you are in deep trouble !
negative	i ordered a mirror for my truck and got the wrong one .
negative	i then wanted to send it back and just swap it for the correct one i ordered , but it was impossible over email and i couldn_'_t find a phone_number .
negative	i wont be ordering from here again .
negative	i will never do_business with these_people again !!
negative	!
negative	i ordered groceries online from asda recently and i didn_'_t receive my order at all despite the fact that they are 0 days late and i contacted their customer service few_times regarding this issue and they didn_'_t respond at al .
negative	customer service in asda is a total disgrace .
negative	i sold things online for 000_dollars .
negative	long_story short the guy wanted to send the stuff back so he opened up a claim .
negative	i never got my stuff and my money was sent back to him .
negative	paypal refuses to refund me .
negative	what a joke !
negative	i even have paperwork from fedex claiming he reversed shipment once refund was received .
negative	what am i able to do ?
negative	ordered parts on a sunday_afternoon , did not ship till wednsday .
negative	did not recieve till monday , 0 days after i ordered .
negative	ordered 0 parts .
negative	0 was right other was wrong .
negative	lookes all over invoice and the wrong part number does not appear .
negative	finally found a phone_number on the net and was put on hold for 0 hour 00_minutes and got a recording no one available at this time please try later .
negative	been trying to get right part for 0 days to no_avail .
negative	guess i am out the money and have to buy part locally .
negative	i will never buy from them again !!!!!!
negative	!
negative	i ordered several parts on this my first order .
negative	the first box came , no problem , waited several days then the next box came .
negative	the main part i need and ordered is not in the box .
negative	i checked my tracking order number for that part , and it shows delivered .
negative	it is not in the box !
negative	i tried to call , however they are closed and the voice_message refers me to go online .
negative	i go on line and it states , " our ticket system is down " what kind of of customer_support_ticket system are you using ?
negative	very unhappy
negative	i bought some bones for my dog and it cost me a lot more than if i were to go to the store and get them because of the shipping fees .
negative	just not worth it
negative	i called the company three ( 0 ) times about an order for radio_knobs for my truck and wasn_'_t quite sure that the package i was sent was the right one .
negative	i have never gotten a call back from the company and like i have told them in my phone_call today which i expect an answer on monday and if i do not hear from them i will write the bbb ( bettter business_bureau ) so that you can understand .
negative	they want their damn money faster_than fast and do not want to have anything to do with the customer after that .
negative	i am going to inform my credit_card company along with the bbb as to the way they do_business .
negative	they are not fooling around with some of their ( in my opinion ) local yokels .
negative	they have got a tiger by the tail and are in for a big surprise .
negative	i ordered a $_00 part that comes with screws and a washer which are necessary to complete the repair .
negative	those screws and washer were not received .
negative	when i asked for them to provide these parts which were listed on the website i received no response .
negative	when i attempted to follow_up on this request i received an e_-_mail titled_" support_ticket denied ".
negative	tonight i am spending my evening making a custom washer and trying to find screws that will fit .
negative	oh , and writing this charming review !
negative	again i am out $_00 for ship to and back to parts_geek on the radio_knobs , malibu 0000 , product did not fit .
negative	i should not have had to pay for the return .
negative	bought erg valve for friend that worked out ok . won_'_t be buying anything_else from these_guys again .
negative	terable terable terable terable
negative	this is disappointing .
negative	i tried to buy a $_00 us psn account but they gave_me a used one or not working code .
negative	when i tried to input the codes in my psn it said " funds could not be transferred to your wallet ".
negative	i have high_hopes for this site but it wasn_'_t really pleasant .
negative	i '_m not planning to buy anymore psn_cards in your site .
negative	this store is very bad , i order transmission pan for a 0000 blazer , advertisement stated that it comes with drain_plug , i receive the part , it did not come with it , i ask the salesmen twice , if it comes with it , he said yes , before i order it , this is false_advertisement ,
negative	would not cover for return shipping , that they should have
negative	because this is their mistake , would not answer my email right_away
negative	finally answer and lied by saying the vendor would not cover return shipping and that i lost the drain_plug when i open the box , full of shit this people are !
negative	very dishonest !
negative	they also have a fake phone_number in their site , i called this number nobody answer it all day long but recording , beware of this seller - parts_geek !
negative	they have a link at ebay watch out for this link !
negative	i order parts from others and they refund my money or exchange , shipping included with no problem !
negative	like i said watch out for this seller !!!!
negative	they stink !!!!!!!!!!!!
negative	!
negative	you cannot talk to a liveperson if u call there cust .
negative	serv .
negative	no you will get a recording after the music that says we are experincing high call_volume right now please try your call again later .
negative	i donot recommend ordering from this website .
negative	the parts look like they fill fit your vechile the way they are advertised online but when u get them there the wrong ones u have to pay to ship them back and wait for them to send you a rma no and if they send u one .
negative	i keep sending them an_email support_ticket and i get no response except for we will have an represnentaive follow_up with you in the next 00 - 00_hrs and they never call you .
negative	they have still not sent an_rma no for everything that we ordered .
negative	the product was broken and when i called to report it i was told to take a picture of the broken part and email it in .
negative	i think this is terrible to put the burden on the customer to rectify the problem .
negative	what you should have done was to offer to reship me another product and take the broken one back when the replacement was delivered or directed me to return the broken product and wait for a replacement .
negative	now i am so pissed_off i am thinking or returning the product and ordering from another supplier .
negative	am i being unreasonable ??
negative	?
negative	product never came & it '_s been over 00 days now .
negative	gearzap have informed me that there is going to be a delay in sending the goods .
negative	they appear to have initiated payment through paypal , but i '_m not clear whether the transaction will complete even if the goods haven_'_t arrived .
negative	time will tell , i guess .
negative	i received the following email from supplementwarehouse . com after_submitting an order and my credit_card info :
negative	your order is currently on hold pending your response .
negative	the price matches you submitted are considered invalid and will not be adjusted as requested .
negative	if you would like to submit alternate price matches you may do so by submitting a help_desk ticket or by contacting customer service at 000 - 000 - 0000 .
negative	your current adjusted total for this order is $_000 . 00 if you would like to submit the order at our pricing .
negative	i followed their directions in regards to the advertised price match .
negative	my total should have been $_000 . 00 if they honored their written price match policy .
negative	their website claims that if a price match is denied , a written statement notifying the buyer as to why the denial was received would be provided .
negative	here is their statement regarding price match denials :
negative	if price matches submitted are not approved / declined :
negative	you will receive an_email regarding the status of your order and reason for disapproval .
negative	your order will be kept on file and can be reinstated with our posted prices .
negative	you may also submit a new and valid price match for the price match team to review by emailing the help_desk or calling our customer_support_team .
negative	as you can see from their email which denied my price match , they did not provide a reason for the denial , they make a shady statement in their email that " the price matches you submitted are considered invalid and will not be adjusted as requested ."
negative	the term " considered invalid " is not a reason for disapproval .
negative	if the price match i provided was false , then that would be a reason .
negative	if the company that i wanted them to match was going out of business or running a short_term promotion that was cutting their regular price down , then that would be a valid reason for supplementwarehouse . com to deny the price match .
negative	i won_'_t do_business with this company and i suggest that you don_'_t either .
negative	ichapple0 @_gmail . com 00 / 00 / 00 wheres my order
negative	eazypark '_s lack of professionalism and poor customer service caused us to almost miss our outgoing flight .
negative	after my initial call to them , i had to wait almost an_hour and a half to have my car collected .
negative	eazypark stated that they would be there in 00_minutes , however the company did not answer my calls after i called them back 00_minutes later to find out where they were .
negative	i finally did get an answer , only to find that , the same as an_hour before , they would be there in ‘ 00_minutes ’.
negative	worried_about missing the flight , i was about to park on the turn - up and pay parking , when my partner , waiting for the company to show themselves , advised that a representative from the company had been waiting there for at_least , ‘ 00_minutes ’, but made no effort to identify themselves or wear any kind of company clothing .
negative	our experience with them on arrival back to manchester was very unpleasant as expected , where the company could not specify a time to collect us and wanted to call us back in , again , 00_minutes .
negative	having insisted that we would not call them back and required collecting immediately , i found that my car had still not been returned .
negative	after some exchange about ' not following their instructions ', my final call to the company stated that if the car was not returned in the ’ 00_minutes ’ they specified that i would call the police to report the car stolen .
negative	my car was promptly returned to me at this time .
negative	avoid eazypark at all costs .
negative	it it worth it to pay £_00 more for parking to have a trustworthy company deal with your car .
negative	or leave it on the long stay .
negative	i didn_'_t make .
negative	purchase wtf is going on heew
negative	i found the bookit . com pricing online through dealnews . com and saw that it was better_than the price i had previously tried to find myself for a total package .
negative	i found the hotel i was looking for and starting clicking through to book the package .
negative	this is where the problems start .
negative	bookit . com hides the coupon entry line at the bottom left_hand corner of the screen .
negative	as i was going through the checkout , i didn_'_t get the chance to enter that code in because i didn_'_t see an entry box .
negative	hence , i lost out on $_00 of room fees and $_000 restaurant . com coupon_code .
negative	i called to ask for assistance on this , but the customer service gentleman that answered was probably the least friendly person you could speak to .
negative	basically , he said " you didn_'_t enter it , you don_'_t get it ."
negative	secondly , i immediately found better pricing after i had made my final booking on hotwire , priceline , hotels . com , and pretty_much any other booking site you can think of .
negative	while clicking through , i noticed that bookit . com had a pricematching option , so i decided to call them and pricematch .
negative	low and behold , this program does not allow pricematching for packages .
negative	nowhere in the language is that explained in detail .
negative	the customer service woman that answered was at_least nice and tried to be helpful , but unfortunately was unable to do anything .
negative	expedia , travelocity , priceline and every other company out there will pricematch package deals .
negative	bookit . com is the only one that refused to do so .
negative	that '_s as bait and switch as it gets .
negative	i probably_won_'_t be using bookit . com in the future .
negative	i '_ve never had this kind of confusion before when using a travel booking website .
negative	overall , i found this site to be much of a bait and switch and i will never use it again .
negative	i highly_recommend people just stick with the basic websites like expedia or travelocity as at_least they honor their price match_guarantee , unlike bookit . com .
negative	it sucks to feel_cheated by a company you just paid a ton of money to .
negative	the only way to get service with avast is through a technical_support line or their online system and there is no customer service number to contact .
negative	they were unable to resolve my issue and just simply stopped responding to me .
negative	they wouldn_'_t even give me a partial_refund .
negative	i even opened a customer service ticket through their online system and never got a single response from them .
negative	i would highly_recommend using another product and wouldn_'_t give these crooks a single penny .
negative	i bought a transmission dipstick for my mercedes from u & didn_'_t fit my car .
negative	i eaimailed u about this & the response i got was that u dont suggest i buy those from u .
negative	no return or resulution offered .
negative	i will never buy another part from u & im telling all my friends that work on cars about this .
negative	despite a phone_call and an_email sent to sports online , i have still not received my refund which is totally_unacceptable .
negative	they assured me 00 days ago that they would shortly process the refund .
negative	i would not recommend this company to anyone .
negative	got $ 0 . 00 for my mobile after being told i would get $_00 as per their website .
negative	tried to cancel and wouldnt let_me .
negative	wouldn_'_t use again
negative	if partsgeek . com sends the wrong part , as they state , they do not correct the matter and issue a postpaid return for an error they made .
negative	phonepower has very friendly people but the tech - support has not followed through well and does not do a good job here .
negative	their tech_support group is going to work with you for hours on the phone so be prepared to spend a lot of time .
negative	then when they have to follow_up be prepared for someone new to start over .
negative	probably the most frustrating thing is that they have different suggestions on every_single phone_call .
negative	meanwhile i still continue to experience multiple dropped_calls and failed outbound calls .
negative	very poor for a page service .
negative	i actually canceled my order that i placed because the final invoice had a ridiculously_expensive service charge included .
negative	that made the cost of the contacts higher , much higher_than your competitor .
negative	the fact that there was no mention of this charge and that it just appeared on the final check out screen made me feel_like i was being extorted .
negative	someone_who is not paying close attention could quite easily get suckered into paying without_realizing .
negative	closed my small unit and moved to a large unit .
negative	they did not prorate the fee for the small unit , they charged me for the entire rest of the month .
negative	i was moving out on the 0th and had to pay for the entire rest of the month .
negative	then had to pay a move out fee even_though i was moving to a larger unit .
negative	moved to a large unit less_than 000 feet away and had to pay all the extra hidden_fees i had to pay when i opened up the first unit .
negative	out of convenience i paid them .
negative	i tried to haggle with the clerk but had no luck in getting any of the outrageous hidden fee waived .
negative	obviously the minimum_wage earner at the front_desk could care less about their job .
negative	can '_t really blame them if i was making $ 0 . 00 an_hour i wouldn_'_t give a shit either .
negative	if i had a truck i would have relocated to another storage place .
negative	would never choose public_storage again or recommend them to anyone .
negative	i feel i was taken for a ride .
negative	website does not state if mirror is for left or right side , only an image , which was left_side .
negative	then they shipped a right side
negative	mirror , claiming that '_s what i ordered .
negative	then they charge a 00_% restocking_fee .
negative	later views of the same product does not state if left or right and has no image .
negative	before ordering i attempted to call their 000 # ...
negative	i waited for long_periods of time without their answering .
negative	then when attempting to contact them after receiving the wrong part , i was unable to get an answer on the 000 #.
negative	the 000 # is a joke .
negative	this is a scam to get the 00_% restocking_fee which is significant on $_000 item .
negative	plus it cost me over $_00 to return the part .
negative	this company is crooked .
negative	customer service acts like it '_s not their problem .
negative	i paid for the " need it now " service and still didn_'_t ship on time .
negative	paid for 0 day shipping they didn_'_t use that method .
negative	they will not admit they made a mistake .
negative	was hung_up on numerous_times even by they " customer service manager " ( don_'_t think it really was one ) because they couldn_'_t answer my questions .
negative	blamed everything on the shipping department that they supposedly didn_'_t have access to communicate with .
negative	lots & lots of extra fees .
negative	wrong part , and it said i would get all the studs i only got two .
negative	we still_haven_'_t received the snugg ipad_cover we ordered over a week_ago .
negative	when we '_ve ordered from them before the product was received in 0 days .
negative	the order status said it was in stock but to date it has not appeared .
negative	not at all pleased .
negative	the reservations specialist had such a thick accent ( spanish , i believe ) that she was terribly hard to understand .
negative	she ended_up booking my knoxville tn reservation in clarksville , tn .
negative	then it took her forever to figure_out how to cancel the reservation she just made and switch it to knoxville .
negative	after 00_minutes i hung_up .
negative	purchased a rebuilt power brake_booster for my 00 plymouth fury .
negative	they sent a bendix instead of the midland the part number specified ( and pictured ).
negative	i made it work but it '_s not the same .
negative	the real problem : i have made two requests for a core_return form with no response .
negative	they have a 00 day core_return_policy with no exceptions and you can '_t return the core without the form .
negative	this looks_like a scam to me to keep your core_deposit .
negative	i '_m a first time customer and last time customer so i guess it '_s back to rockauto .
negative	don_'_t have a clue if travelocity is any good , since my wife had an_emergency gall bladder operation .
negative	i due know that i tried to contact travelocity 0 days before we were supposed to go and was put on hold for 00 to 00_minutes and i just gave up and tended to my wife ....... very disappointing to say the least .
negative	one month on still no glasses , simple prescription becomes long drawn_out experience .
negative	try to fob you off with all_sorts of terms and conditions when you ask for your money back , so they take your money off you and then you just have to wait , tough !
negative	they hold all the cards once they have taken your money and the back and forth emails to get anything done are a time_consuming nightmare .
negative	at the time of writing this i still have not received anything for my money , and i am still being fobbed_off , do not use unless you want to wait , and wait and receive nothing .
negative	but of course it is not their fault it is yours for not reading the terms and conditions .
negative	like i said more than 0 month and i am still_waiting and still being fobbed_off , another email today i suppose , just another dodgy company
negative	well been trying to change flights but can '_t contact your company emailed you with no reply now how would u rate u i want my ticket refunded now as i am going to loose the new job that i was ment to fly home for nice your customer survive sux
negative	paid more for a better part they sent the cheap part and are now unresponsive to any return or getting the right part , it '_s my problem .
negative	well for starters , quality inn had my initial reservation screwed_up .
negative	they put me in a room with two beds and i had reserved a room with a king and a sofabed .
negative	the desk gal was new ( two_nights ) and had to call her_supervisor .
negative	a tattoed lady showed_up , but said my reservation number was not valid .
negative	luckily i had me email_confirmation .
negative	they finally got us the room we reserved .
negative	however , it was dirty and hairy in the bathroom .
negative	we were too tired to complain .
negative	it got worse , there was no food for breakfast , but the did make more , witha delay .
negative	when we returned our key would not work , they graciously made new keys .
negative	the second morning , more of the same with breakfast , not nearly enough food .
negative	when we returned that evening our room was not made up at all and our key would not work .
negative	the room was never made up but they did make new keys .
negative	the second night a party in the room next to us , very loud however they did quiet down about 0 : 00 in the morning .
negative	the next_day we ate a perkins .
negative	we did have a hassle on the third night since our confirmation was different , we were not scheduled to be there , but the main supervisor ( with only one piercing ) graciously comp ' d us for the third night .
negative	will never stay at quality inns again , and will use all known websites to avoid making_reservations through you ...
negative	confirmation # 000000000000 and 000000000 , nice ....
negative	despite the various 0_star reviews , i purchased a kitchen_sink and monoblock tap unit .
negative	within minutes i received an_automated email explain the one of the " in stock " items were not available for 0_weeks , so i cancelled the sink from the order and waited for the tap .
negative	0 days_later it arrived ( next_day delivery evidently has a different meaning to tapsuk !).
negative	0 emails and 0 phone_calls ( at £ 0 . 00 a minute ) and i am still owed a refund of over £_000 .
negative	no - one will call you back , it '_s like chasing a ghost .
negative	i wouldn_'_t use this company again if my life depended on it , my worst online experience of online shopping in over 00 years of buying online !
negative	!
negative	correct product ordered , invoiced and on delivery note - wrong product in the box .
negative	how basic an error can you get ?
negative	warehouse monkeys , no apparently the different product code was the manufacturers fault .
negative	the fact that the packer couldn_'_t check that the product code was the same on the packing note to that on the item couldn_'_t possibly have been the answer , could it ?
negative	five weeks from order to refund , if you buy from these_people you better pray that nothing goes_wrong , the worst customer service i have ever come_across .
negative	i will never think of buying from these_people again .

negative	would not recommend need to get act_together on whats_going on out there
negative	terrible customer service !
negative	have emailed them five times to return an item and no response !!!
negative	it is unbelievable .
negative	this has happened over the course of a month .
negative	five emails , not a word back .
negative	do not shop_here !
negative	ordered a part came in damaged and not from shipping , tried to call hour and half on hold , finally received credit , minus a restocking_fee , which they told me not to return .
negative	will never use partsgeek again .
negative	good luck if you do .
negative	this has to be the worst car company rental out there total_rip - off .
negative	being unable to get the car due to an insane amount required as a deposit of $ 0000 . 00_usd , the company refuses to refund the amount pre_- paid .
negative	also they are based out of the uk , so good luck trying to get a hold of them .
negative	i had to dispute the charges directly with my bank and let them handle the situation .
negative	i already have paid paypal and still have not gotten my working gamecards purchased 00 days ago ... already emailed support with all the needed screenshots and requested information but to no_avail .
negative	( we need 0 screenshots showing webpage where you are redeeming your code with code written into input field , but not submitted yet and than screen with an error_message after_submitting a code .
negative	- several_times already )
negative	please return my money
negative	order filter , paid with paypal and paypal responded .
negative	confirmation from splash quick but haven_'_t heard a thing about shipping .
negative	sent email this morning to customer service with no responce after 0 hours .
negative	how can i cancel this order ?
negative	also site has coupon_code but not valid with items ending with $. 00 per person i called .
negative	advertized as a great deal , it looked very good on paper .
negative	but , by the time all was said and done , there were no discounts ; in fact i lost money .
negative	don_'_t do it !!
negative	!
negative	i put in the make , year and model of my car and order the recommended gas spring .
negative	it was the wrong one .
negative	have used in the past without problem , but despited repeated reassurance that i will get my amazon gift_certificate it has yet to arrive ( 0rd july ) i will not be using them again !!
negative	!
negative	lange zeit keine_probleme , und_dann eine rechnung über 000_euro , bei 00 euro monatlichem tarif .
negative	unvorstellbar , das handy ist auf gms eingestellt und soll auf einmal für 0 tage daten empfangen haben .
negative	in diesen 0 tagen sind gebühren für daten auf 00 euro angelaufen .
negative	zumindest ist_es auf_der rechnung so ausgewiesen .
negative	natürlich war es über weihnachten , wo andere leute neue handys ausprobieren und ihre karte anders nutzen .
negative	dies war bei uns nicht der fall , aber wehe dem_der hier eine masche sieht .
negative	diese firma ist auf keinen fall zu_empfehlen , da lieber direkt zu_einem anbieter , der hier und da kulanz als lösung sieht .
negative	bei debitel gibt_es_nur standard schreiben und antworten und zeit ... gut auf zeit spielen , der kunde hat ja schon bezahlt , der betrag ist sicher abgebucht .
negative	vielen_dank , ihr macht handy nutzung richtig teuer !!
negative	!
negative	this company is rediculous and i will never shop there again .
negative	i got my new motorola droid on 00 / 0 .
negative	i checked out their site and ordered a case and a screen_protector for it on the same day .
negative	it said the screen_protector was on hand and would be shipped out immediately but i ' d have to wait_until 00 / 00 for the case to ship .
negative	no big_deal , i '_ll place the order .
negative	i check the order status on 00 / 00 .
negative	the screen_protector still_hasn_'_t arrived and the case hasn_'_t shipped .
negative	what happened ?
negative	i checked their site and now they say they aren_'_t shipping the cases until 00 / 00 ... why would they lie ?
negative	i '_m not waiting an extra 00 days for a case , so i asked for a refund .
negative	the cost of the case was 00 $+ 0 $ shipping = 00 $.
negative	their policy says they refund your purchase minus 0 $ or 0 %, which ever is greater .
negative	they refunded me 00 $ even_though the shipping cost never occurred since nothing was shipped so i should not be charged for it .
negative	don_'_t shop from this place unless you like slow shipping , being lied to about shipping dates , and ridiculous policies .
negative	ordered goods online ( 0th_nov ) , all goods showing as in stock .
negative	rang next_day just to confirm order had been received & was told 0 item ( bath ) was out of stock but would definitely 000_% be in on tues 00th .
negative	went_ahead and arranged & booked in builder and plumber to refurbish bathroom .
negative	chased again on thurs 00th as hadn_'_t heard_anything only to be told bath still out of stock & " might " be in on 00th !!
negative	not happy at all .
negative	jon
negative	they set_up an account , even a trial one , refuse to provide the service requested but if you stay with them they will charge you .
negative	it '_s a scam .
negative	informed the parts dept .
negative	that i had a rear_wheel camber alignment problem on my ' 00 mb e000 .
negative	instead of sending camber kits with adjustable cam angle bolts , they sent two new camber struts and 0 sets of regular bolts .
negative	my original struts are good , i just need to adjust the angle of these struts .
negative	the parts they sent are useless to me , and no one will answer my calls or return my messages .
negative	the service i am receiving is terrible !!!!
negative	!
negative	i want a refund !!!
negative	!
negative	it has_been a full 00 weeks since i sent payment to keys0iphone to unlock my at & t iphone_0s .
negative	my phone was never unlocked .
negative	repeated_requests for refund have been denied .
negative	further , keys0iphone appears to be busy disputing my negative trustpilot review .
negative	do not trust keys0iphone .
negative	do not send money to keys0iphone .
negative	you have been warned .
negative	having ordered a product ( bike storage shed ) that was described as 0 - 0 day delivery i became frustrated when after 00 days i had not received any notification .
negative	this was frustrating as the order was planned to coincide with people being at home to take delivery of a large item .
negative	multiple e_mails are unanswered , impossible to get through on the customer service line .
negative	i am trying this as a final resort as i have seen responses to others complaints here .
negative	update
negative	after multiple conversations with a customer service rep i finally received my ordered product 00 days after ordering .
negative	this on a 0 - 0 day delivery product .
negative	after being promised a notification from the courier of delivery the bike shed arrived unannounced and by pure chance i was able to take the order having been for a doctors appointment .
negative	if this had not been the case i would have again had no_idea about where my delivery was .
negative	finally the product is at best average with many of the components of poor quality .
negative	luckily i am from a building background and made various design changes and added materials and fixing to make the shed usable .
negative	this adding substantially to the cost .
negative	moral of the story is to use a reputable online store and pay a bit more for quality .
negative	never again worldstores .
negative	further update .
negative	the 0_star reviews are becoming more and more dubious for this company .
negative	look at them carefully and with a massive pinch of salt !
negative	it is strange how the 0_star reviews have shocking grammar and spelling .
negative	coincidence ?
negative	the box i got was torn to shreds and had ton of clear tape holding the fragments together .
negative	after opening the box the axle looked in good shape so i tore my car apart and found the the had the wrong axle in it .
negative	part # was right checked 0 times on the web_site but the axle in the box was 0in too_long .
negative	i submitted a ticket because the do not answer the phone and 0 days_later still no response , but they gave_me this handy your opinion email , so here it is service blows , customer_support is the worst i have ever_seen and i will go out of my way to steer anyone i can away .
negative	bought a grill assembly or i thought i did .
negative	comes to house only one piece of the grill .
negative	turns_out the pictures shows a complete grill assembly but only got half they sell it in two pieces but picture or description doesnt state that .
negative	i was able to purchase other side at another web_site after waiting for a replay for two_days and the other side of grill was cheaper on another site as well as freight .
negative	people ddos you when you visit this website
negative	my website crashes all the time , it also has zero ddos protection /.
negative	this website is a phishing website
negative	paypal is not willing to do anything about the 0 - 0 times i '_ve been scammed , they also charge you immense fees on top of the regular paypal transaction fees
negative	i ran_out of my storage_space in 0_weeks .
negative	their team was very rude to me when i opened a support tikcet
negative	the support_team is super slow , took me 00 days for a response
negative	please bring the old comments back !
negative	connection sucks , cannot connect at all at times
negative	too many robot responses and transfers take up to a month

negative	i yhink your customer sevice sucks because i get no human responce and i have been having_trouble i can change my point of view if i got one from you .
negative	either my timing chain is bad which it is a new double roller or the cam is wrong i will comment when i figure it out
negative	i ordered all the front_end parts for my ranger upper_control_arms with ball_joint combinations , and the lower_ball_joints .
negative	i recieved the lowers first that went well then the right upper_control_arm assembly that went well .
negative	i received an_email that i was refunded the money for the left upper_control_arm i ordered as it was not in stock .
negative	i called to see if there was a replacement , i gave my vehicle description again 0000_ford_ranger extended cab 0 . o with coil_springs .
negative	the said they had a doorman .
negative	they said they would ship .
negative	great !!!
negative	this is where it starts to suck .
negative	i need that part because i am moving across country and need to drive that truck , i have one week to spare and the control_arm arrives .
negative	i went out to place it on the truck , and it looks wrong , the ball_joint stud is too big for the spindle .
negative	i look up the part # at advanced_auto_parts , you guys sent me one for a 0 whelk drive ranger .
negative	i called in got no one , i emailed support and this is what i got .
negative	you can send back the part for a full_refund but you must pay for shpipping , yeah right i must pay for shipping because of your screw up . i don_'_t freaking think so .
negative	i went back to advance_auto bought what i needed , and took the part to sell , at auction .
negative	oh by the way i was decent enough to list it as a 0 wheel_drive ranger left upper_control_arm .
negative	this could not have sucked more .
negative	horrible customer service .
negative	after_placing the order , i sent my prescription right after .
negative	i also paid for 0 - day delivery as well .
negative	after not receiving the product in a week ( 0 - day shipping , gave extra time to the company ) i called and was told that they have not received my prescription , despite having all my contact information no one emailed or called for the prescription .
negative	i sent the email again and within_seconds it was received and i was assured that i will receive the product next business day .
negative	0_weeks after_placing the order i finally got really tired .
negative	i called customer service as i was upset by this point instead of being apologetic i was told that i can return the product .
negative	customer service agent said she will send an_email with return_label , did not receive any email , after waiting 0 week called back again and the agent sent the email which was received within 00 secs .
negative	i still have not received the product due to which they will not credit me for the original order .
negative	i asked for the supervisor and was told that she is on lunch .
negative	when i finally got to talk to the supervisor ( sara ) she blamed me and said that people make mistakes .
negative	she did not apologize and put the phone down while i was talking .
negative	now i am taking this to my bank .
negative	i thought i was getting a high side pressure switch with ac hose .
negative	i placed an order for flowers to try and cheer up my girlfriend '_s day .
negative	i placed an order for the flowers on a friday_night ( 00 / 00 / 0000 ) and requested they be delivered the following_day ( 00 / 00 / 0000 ).
negative	after receiving an order confirmation_email which stated the flowers would in fact be delivered on the 00th , they were not delivered .
negative	i sent in an_email on the 00th requesting information from customer service on what happened with the delivery to which i never received a direct response .
negative	on the 00th i received an_email in the am stating that due to technical_issues the order was never filled .
negative	a few hours after this email i received a direct email from their customer service team asking if i would like the flowers to still be delivered .
negative	unfortunately my time zone is a few hours different from theirs and my response was received at 0pm .
negative	the company did not fill my order until the following business day , tuesday 00 / 00 / 0000 .
negative	i '_m definitely dissatisfied with the service i received .
negative	the fact that the flowers arrived 0 days late completely negated the reason_why i ordered them .
negative	i would not recommend their services and will try to use a local_florist from now forward .
negative	aside from their poor service , the flowers were allegedly nice and my girlfriend did enjoy them .
negative	the ink_cartridges that were bought did not work as_advertised , had to go back to oem ( epson ).
negative	bought a $_000 part and they sent me the wrong one .
negative	they dont have a phone_number which is ridiculous .
negative	the only way to contact them is to use their " customer service ticket " they said they would contact me in 00_hours or less , it took them 0 days to reply .
negative	i had to buy the part from my local_auto_parts store .
negative	i sent it back for a refund and i had to pay the shipping and they charge a 00_% restocking_fee !
negative	will never do_business with partsgeek again .

negative	as you can imagine , my prescription is pretty strong compared to those with perfect vision , and any minor mistake in it can cause pretty bad results .
negative	i sent them a valid prescription , a valid pupil_distance , and they sent me a pair of glasses that were completely blurry , and i was unable to see unless looking at the very bottom of the lenses .
negative	i contacted framesdirect , and an employee , lori , told me that maybe my prescription was wrong , and that i should get it checked .
negative	my prescription is fine ( less_than a month old ), as i have a pair of glasses from a retail_store that work flawlessly .
negative	after not listening to my complaints , and assuring me that the lenses were okay , she told me i could send them back for a refund .
negative	the refund process requires you to take a loss of roughly 00_% of your initial purchase price .
negative	this is fine , because it is outlined on their website .
negative	what i have a problem with is the fact that : 0 .)
negative	the glasses were of a bad quality - the lenses were not ray - bans , but generic ones without the etching , 0 .)
negative	the prescription / pupil_distance was horribly off , and as a result , i have to take a loss in both a product and money , 0 .)
negative	when i attempted to contact framesdirect about it again , they never responded , 0 .)
negative	they didn_'_t post my honest review on their website , which was of course only a 0_star_rating .
negative	luckily , i received a link to review them on here .
negative	the bottom_line is that many people appear to have a good transaction on framesdirect .
negative	their prices are okay .
negative	however , be cautious about what you purchase .
negative	the ray - ban prescription_glasses do not ship with etched ray - ban lenses , leading you to wonder_if they are generic ones like the ones lenscrafters sells as a cost saving option .
negative	nowhere on the page is this mentioned however .
negative	also , if you have a strong prescription , i would not order from here .
negative	pupil_distance doesn_'_t matter with prescriptions + 0 . 00 to - 0 . 00 , but anything over them does .
negative	i would go to a real store and deal with them , because the customer service , the guarantees , and refund process here is not worth the hassle at all .
negative	managed to select a hotel with the same name , but at the wrong location .
negative	called travelocity to attempt to switch reservation to the correct location .
negative	was told it was against policy .
negative	finally canceled the reservation and ate the loss .
negative	hello beginning i was exited to order ink for my printer because it was cheap comparing to other_places and it was also fast delivered but quickly i became disappointed because the ink was terrible and not readable .
negative	i ended_up buying another altenator and had it nstalled 0 days before this one arrived .
negative	granted i had to pay $_00 more for it but i was in the middle of a roofing job and needed the use of my truck .
negative	i will probably not order from partsgeek in the future since it takes so long to get the product .
negative	i now have an extra altenator .
negative	the ( ebay ) stores themselves are fine .
negative	it '_s ebay that '_s the problem .
negative	the company offers no customer_support for either buyers or sellers .
negative	they do list a phone_number , but calling it only gets you put on hold until they hang_up on you several hours_later .
negative	ebay has contracted with app developers , one of whose apps has taken the liberty to commandeer other people '_s ebay stores and listings , and won_'_t go away no matter what the seller does to get_rid of it .
negative	all - in - all , if you find an item you like via an ebay store , i would strongly_suggest googling the company '_s name and buying it directly through their website instead of through their ebay store .
negative	iwas visiting my son in another state for the thanksgiving holiday .
negative	i had ordered parts from partsgeek .
negative	i had expected them to be on the way .
negative	however , when i arrived home and checked my email , i found that nothing had happened at all and that they would not process because my credit_card and home address were not where the items were to be sent .
negative	in the meantime my wife had a heart_attack and this was not what i wanted to deal with now .
negative	i tried to correspond with partsgeek only to receive a message that they would get back to me within 00_hours .
negative	i then cancel my order and got the parts elsewhere .
negative	there is no customer service from this company .
negative	i was later relaying this story to a buddy of mine only to find an even worse story with dealing_with partsgeek .
negative	i will not even look at there site again in the future .
negative	the website is clear and quite appealing .
negative	my cdkey has_been sent in just a few_minutes ...
negative	...
negative	but , it is not matching the description made on the site .
negative	i have bought " civilization v gold edition " during my order and they have me " civilization v goty edition " sent .
negative	the problem is that the goty edition does not include all the dlc that the gold edition contains .
negative	the support has_been contacted , but for now it is a terrible experience on this site .
negative	i '_ll update this review after the support '_s response .
negative	købte sidste sommer en_hel kitepakke fra dette firma .
negative	da pakken ankom med_posten var alt som_det skulle_være og pakken blev tjekket efter for skader inden posten fik lov at køre som_man jo skal , hvis_man vil gøre sig nogle forventninger om erstatning .
negative	da_jeg åbner pakken bliver jeg selvfølgelig glad for alt det nye udstyr , men glæden bliver lynhurtigt afløst af_en frustration , da_jeg opdager en skade i den_ene ende af boardet .
negative	eftersom jeg tjekkede pakken var jeg jo sikker på at det måtte være sket før forsendelsen .
negative	jeg kontakter omgående kitedanmark med_den klare forventning at man_bliver mødt med forståelse for problemet og en løsning , men i stedet nægter de at skaden kan være deres skyld og_vil ingenting gøre ved det .
negative	det resulterer i at jeg_har_brugt 00 . 000 kroner i deres butik for at få_et produkt der_er ødelagt før_jeg overhovedet har_brugt det .... det_er_ikke i orden .
negative	mit råd : køb aldrig noget fra dette firma !
negative	shopping on the internet is definitely a valued convenience our dealership utilizes .
negative	we purchase only new oem parts to maximize dependability issues as well as having certified repair facilities perform the installation .
negative	your advertised product was slightly less_expensive than your competitor and fulfilled our new , oem requirement .
negative	there was no difference_between you and your competitors until your part proved defective on installation .
negative	then we immediately learned you separate yourself from your customer with no possible human contact - only internet .
negative	then , unlike your competitors , the customer must pay the additional_costs for return along with insurance , no pick_up , thus causing your price to be very expensive , time_consuming , and undesirable .
negative	all this being said , as of today , we have not been refunded and do not know if we will actually receive a refund for up to 00 days according to your site .
negative	nothing like your competitors , who do not penalize a purchaser for purchasing a defective product they have sold .
negative	they have earned our business , even if their price is slightly_higher because they stand_behind a product should it prove defective .
negative	i am leery to purchase future products from your site .
negative	to this day , no possible way to talk to a human about the issue , unlike your competitors .
negative	poor business model for customers .
negative	basically i have ordered quite a few items from you now and on a few occasions i have paid monies over to you and then after you have taken my monies you have stated that you no_longer stock the items .
negative	surely a company as big as yours knows what stock you have .
negative	please do not advertise things in your brochure or website and take monies if you do not have the items .
negative	also i have not been told whether you have refunded my monies yet or not for the items you do not have .
negative	very unprofessional .
negative	mr coates
negative	i applied to unlock an iphone_0s which came out " not found " after 0_weeks saying the phone ain '_t in at & t network , then they just emailed saying that at & t changed their policy so wait up to 00 business days more or ask for a refund !
negative	i accepted waiting more .
negative	also i had one free unlock right which i asked them to unlock an iphone 0 but it just disappeared from my profile right after i contacted them !
negative	i asked them to proceed my requests however they just refunded the money without giving any notification !
negative	it '_s true that at & t changed their policy and it is harder now to imei_unlock the iphones but att - iphone - unlock . com is not the door you should knock !
negative	i paid for overnight shipping only to get my items over a week after i placed the order .
negative	they owe me a shipping refund .
negative	tried_calling on there hopeless phone system only to have it hang_up on me .
negative	most_likely the last time i ever get parts from you .
negative	never received my parts .
negative	disappointed
negative	its been 0_weeks and have not received my product .
negative	i emailed them and have not got a reply
negative	i asked for a specific part and was quoted .
negative	i ordered the quoted part and was sent a different part number and it was for the wrong year of my vehical .
negative	two_weeks of going back and forth and still don_'_t have the correct part number or any indication of if it has_been sent .
negative	won_'_t ever use partsgeek . com again .
negative	all my parts came at derfrent times , one part came a whole day latter then everthing eles .
negative	also i was sent the wrong part and there is no phone_number to fix this , you have to send a ticket from and then wait 00 to 00_hours you them to respon to you .
negative	the chicken i received in my first order from muscle_foods was top quality at a price that was hard to beat .
negative	the chicken i ordered in my second order just didn_'_t come ...
negative	to be fair , it wasn_'_t directly muscle_foods fault , it was due to the fact of the very unreliable yodel service that they use that don_'_t seem to know their eyes from their a *** and deliver your perishable goods in a van that '_s not even refrigerated .
negative	simply due to muscle_foods choice to use such a rubbish delivery service means they have one less customer .
negative	invoiced higher amount than agreed for a different bike .
negative	did not respond to order cancellation .
negative	it seems like a . scam
negative	i have been a bitdefender customer for four years , and was offered a renewal price of $_00 . 00 for a year of internet security 0000 .
negative	after being overcharged ( at $_00 . 00 ), your customer service department has refused to refund me the overcharge and is blaming me for not catching the mistake within a 00 - day refund window , even_though this is not a " refund " situation .
negative	it is a flat - out overcharge .
negative	it is bitdefender '_s mistake .
negative	what terrible customer service .
negative	my family and my company will not use bitdefender products in the future .
negative	my facebook and twitter will spread the word of your terrible treatment of your customers .
negative	asked for a gas_cap for a 0000_bmw_000i . sounds pretty simple
negative	the one you sent absolutley , doen '_t fit ?
negative	i could waste so much time to say the issues i have with is company .
negative	bought a tablet for my wifes_birthday last september .
negative	since then its gone wrong , the charge plug .
negative	went into the shop in southport .
negative	the way my wife was dealt_with was a disgrace .
negative	have never had or experienced such bad customer service .
negative	everyone should be warned don_'_t buy anything from this company and we should all highlight how bad this company is .
negative	i have been looking at other_sites and so many people are having the same problem .
negative	we all need to post how bad currys are on all the web sites we can
negative	i called the hotel number on the internet thinking this was the website .
negative	i was never told otherwise and when i requested the corporate rate , i was told that only one room was at a rate $_00 higher .
negative	i booked that room and then asked if another employee was staying and could they book a room .
negative	i was told that i was lucky and someone just cancelled and the room was open .
negative	then i find out this was not marriot and i could have contacted them to get the $_000 per_night rate .
negative	this is very unethical to represent marriot this way and i will inform them .
negative	received a damaged item and they have a long process to resend a back ! there is no ownership toward the damaged item and sending me another .
negative	very inconsiderate company !
negative	not so bad on departure , just very hard to understand the telephone operators poor command of the english_language .
negative	when we arrived home it took numerous phone_call attempts to get through to sky one and then we were kept waiting for over 00_minutes for our car to be delivered .
negative	when i asked why it had taken so long i was told by the laughing driver with a shrug , that the traffic was bad .
negative	no one else seemed to be waiting for long and when we left we encountered no traffic problems .
negative	i could have taken the bus to the long stay car_park and got away home much_quicker .
negative	i shall not be using sky one ever again .
negative	i still have yet to be contacted .
negative	the site sent the wrong part not matching the description .
negative	i have no way to contact them and there is no support system .
negative	i have filled_out their so called ticket numerous_times with no response .
negative	i have a part no good and a waste of money
negative	i still_havent recieved package !!
negative	!
negative	i purchased one ink_cartridge from inkfarm and another from a different vendor at the same time .
negative	the cartridge from inkfarm came in and was installed first .
negative	the printer signal to " check the ink_cartridge " started blinking and would not accept a print job .
negative	the remanufactured_ink_cartridge from the other vendor , when installed , worked great , as if it were a new cartridge .
negative	i will not be buying any more cartridges from ink_farm for this printer
negative	i ordered a smittybuilt front_bumper with the stinger and full_length end caps , warrior fender_flares , hood latch , and driving lights .
negative	0 days after i placed the order i was not notified it shipped .
negative	i called and found out that though they billed me for everything the only items they had in stock was the driving lights .
negative	then i discovered they did not even ship the one item they had .
negative	the lead time on all of the items was weeks not days .
negative	i had to cancel the order and wait to be refunded .
negative	needless to say i was pissed .
negative	i placed the same order with quadratech and all items were in stock and shipped same day .
negative	very disappointing !
negative	ordered parts week before last - mailed check sunday a week_ago - waited_till thursday to call - geek phone rang for 00_minutes before electronic prompt came on to direct me to do a supportr ticket - so i did one - recieved email that said my support_ticket had be turned over to someone to take_care of it , i would hear from someone in 00 - 00_hrs - i '_ve heard_nothing .
negative	track order says waiting for check - my check should have beeb there by last wednesday and posted by thursday and my order should have bee shipped no later than friday_afternoon .
negative	i don_'_t want to press one of your stars yet , but if that is the only way so be it .
negative	you tell me .
negative	i made an order for a game which has already been released over 0 years_ago and a week_later still not received .
negative	i read that if i placed the order before 0pm that day , it would be dispatched on the same day .
negative	a promise which is made throughout the website .
negative	i placed my order around 00 : 00 and kept checking on my order status which was on processing .
negative	it stayed like this and at 00 : 00 i checked the site again and carried_out a search for my game and it was no_longer listed as in stock it was there for a back order .
negative	i called the next_day and was told my purchase would be dispatched that very day and at the end of that day my order process said completed .
negative	here we are a week after_placing the order for a game that has_been out over 0 years_ago and was a best seller so not like it ’_s hard to get hold of ( my local game store had 0 copies in for just a pound more - where i eventually ended_up getting it from )
negative	i had a bad_experience with shopto before .
negative	with another game order which i wanted on release_date and ended_up going to the shop and buying it myself which ended_up quicker_than getting the game from shopto .
negative	i have friends who swear by this place as this was the reason i gave them a try again after the first initial bad_experience .
negative	i '_ve either been really unlucky or i live in part of the world which they have issues distributing to ( north west england ) but the report in all honesty of my own experiences its been ( which i hate to say ) painfully disappointing and have ended_up doing something which i initially came to shopto to avoid which was go and actually buy the game from the local town shopping centre .
negative	*****************************************************************************************
negative	******************************************************************************
negative	update after reply from shopto
negative	******************************************************************************
negative	*****************************************************************************************
negative	good morning ,
negative	i '_m not too sure how i can contact shopto but hopefully i can communicate through yourselves or you could kindly pass the message on or direct me in the correct location .
negative	firstly the order was stuck on processing for over 00_hours and remained so after the 00_hours which prompted my phone_call to the centre .
negative	if it had showed as completed then why would i have called the desk ?
negative	not likely .
negative	so there is some kind of issue there which is not on my part .
negative	i understand that royal_mail delivery is out of your control , however , i have placed an order for a game which is readily_available in any gaming shop , it ’_s over a week_later and no sign what so ever of the game .
negative	what can i say ?
negative	that '_s just not service someone is going to rave_about and recommend is it .
negative	as for the back order business .
negative	what you explain is exactly the reasoning for which i ' d like to think for the game showing as there and available and then on back order .
negative	it '_s easy to state that when you are at the side of the company involved but just think ( which any successful company should do tbh ) how things would like from the customers point of view .
negative	with the scenario i explained .
negative	game that i want at a reasonable time .
negative	check it is stock which it is .
negative	check delivery details and i copy and paste directly ...
negative	delivery
negative	uk orders placed before 00 . 00pm ( mon - fri ) are usually dispatched the same day and 00_% are delivered the following working day .
negative	( uk and mainland only )
negative	now i know the word usually is prominent there but with the 00_% delivered the following_day that to me says that within 0 - 0 days 000_% that game is going to be on my doorstep .
negative	all of the above suggests nothing else , unless .
negative	i am informed from the company i am dealing_with .
negative	so it '_s gone over 00_hours and my order is still on processing , not completed , processing , i check my mails and shopto account expecting to be informed which i have landed in the 0 % unlucky bracket and there is nothing .
negative	so therefore i am going to call the centre , which i did and was informed it would be posted out that day .
negative	time taken from my dinner and more money onto my phone bill .
negative	so now i '_m not only charged for a game ( which i still don_'_t have ) i '_m adding to my phone bill and taking a shorter dinner break .
negative	doesn_'_t all add up to stellar service now does it .
negative	i won_'_t end that with 0 exclamation marks like you have yourself and as it '_s kind of keyboard warrior ' ish ' which is a minor matter i know but still it ’_s not positive is it , it '_s passive aggressive and working in an arm of customer_services myself on a government contract no way in the planet would i ever even contemplate using 0 exclamation marks for any reason what so ever to the person i would be mailing .
negative	you will see on my review i was fair and unbiased and even at the end made excuses and to just put it down to an isolated_incident or due to my geographical location .
negative	i still don_'_t have my game , the only communication that i have had is a mail pushing me to change my review and ending it with a dismissive tone .
negative	nothing about improving my experience or even checking about if i have my purchase or what measures can be made to improve the service shows you don_'_t care what so ever about the " so - called " bread and butter which is getting good games out at a reasonable price you just care about nice fluffy reviews saying how great you are .

negative	the agent i spoke with lied to me about the availability of the hotel i requested .
negative	he told me that he was able to get a room reserved due to a recent cancellation when in fact he actually reserved a room at another hotel in a different city .
negative	he took my payment knowing that he was lying to me .
negative	i will never use your services again to book a hotel_room .
negative	i order apart_from n . j . 0 day ground on 0 / 0 / 0000 / to 0 / 0 / 0000 it comes from c . a .

negative	0 . this is the only on - line service i have used which refuses to honer optical prescriptions provided by the customer , only from the optometrist , but they don_'_t say that until you have bought the glasses .
negative	they wouldn_'_t even accept them from me , a physician licensed to write the rx '_s .
negative	0 . after asking for my money back , they reluctantly agreed to " expedite " the rx , took three_weeks to get them .
negative	0 . interestingly , i ordered the same day a rx for my wife from coastal and received her glasses in 0 days .
negative	longest ever waiting for me from zinni was 0_weeks .
negative	i ' l never use
negative	awful company who we paid and they didnt organise any of our events .
negative	it took 0 months to get money back and we only got it because a mate who is a solicitor threatened them with legal_action !
negative	i also started a massive facebook hate campaign against them amd they were worried abouy the damage it was doing !
negative	i had to remove the campaign as part of the deal struck to get the cash back but its worth doing if your having_trouble .
negative	they also work under some other company names so be_careful !
negative	i was very disappointed , i have been using travelocity for many_years , i decided to go book one of their secret_hotels , and it was the worst place i have ever stayed in .
negative	i tried to get the issue resolved with travelocity , and they said that the ratings are based on information given to them , so it wasn_'_t their fault ..
negative	i told them that their ratings are wrong and would like to have this issue resolved .
negative	they said there is nothing they can do .
negative	i will never use travelocity again , nor will my friends or family .
negative	i tried to buy some rapala walking waist waders from this company as they said they were coming in stock .
negative	i wasted over a week waiting for the confirmation that they were in , only to be told suddenly they don_'_t know when they will be available and are out of stock .
negative	but they still took the payment beforehand .
negative	their phoneline doesn_'_t connect to anyone despite it saying call us if you have problems and you must use the websites contact box for a reply .
negative	although i did get always get a reply to my questions .
negative	they also didn_'_t understand the products measurements and tried to compare them to swimming trunk sizes .
negative	i could have bought some others elsewhere in a fraction of the time and it could have messed_up my plans .
negative	the only good thing was a refund in 00_hours like they promised .
negative	my order is still not filled after 00 days .
negative	i purchased spintires hoping to get the key to play with some friends and i never received the key .
negative	i can '_t get a response from support and their live support hasn_'_t been online one time since my purchase and they are supposed to be open 00_hours a day .
negative	this site is a joke and i would use one of the many other_sites that actually follow through with the sale .
negative	this type of service and support is not acceptable .
negative	i will be sure to submit as many reviews as possible to let others know to steer_clear of this website .
negative	since submitting this review i have received a response from support that only states " we are working on that order , please be patient ."
negative	i have responded to this reply with some questions and they simply reply stating the same thing .
negative	i wish i had used paypal instead of bitcoin so i could issue a charge back and get my money back and purchase the game elsewhere .
negative	i had ordered many things on line , and never ever got anythings like your business .
negative	i ordered the hood_struts and you sent the trunk_struts .
negative	and now i have to send them back and have to pay for the fee and take 00 days to get the money back .
negative	i don_'_t want the money back just wanted my parts .
negative	now you just think who fault is it ?
negative	this is absolutely the worst business i had ever deal with .
negative	i will do what ever it take to make_sure the world will know .
negative	how can i had to pay for your mistake , it doesn_'_t make any sense .
negative	i m still stunt about it .
negative	i have to pay it again to order the right parts and if you make a mistake again then i have to pay the again .
negative	you just think is it right ?
negative	believe me it will catch up with your business soon or later .
negative	i ordered two air_filter for 0000_ford_escape but they supplied wrong rounds air_filter insted of flat one , so i was thinking i made mistakes and i ordered another one but unfortunately they supplied again wrong one .
negative	we thought we were talking to the hotel_directly .
negative	the person gave_us a rate that was lower if we opted for no cancelation option .
negative	we asked if they had a government_rate and she said no .
negative	at check - in we found that the hotel did have a government_rate that was $_00 lower but we couldn_'_t get the rete because we used this service .
negative	i tried to call the number to discuss and i have been on hold for 00_minutes ... so i decided to type this while i waited listening to the same music over and over and over .
negative	extremely poor qulaity product delivered , which_resulted_in electric shock .
negative	no concern at all shown by staff , who were diinterested in the extreme .
negative	avoid , and buy your lights elsewhere
negative	it refuses to accept email_addresses nor does the post code look up work .
negative	switch to internet_explorer to get round this .
negative	flowers delivered with no hitch otherwise .
negative	i booked a hotel for 0 nights through travelocity for approx 000 $, while the actual rate for the same hotel at other_websites for same travel dates were about 000 $ less .
negative	i went to access my unit , i found that the doors were changed and had a different lockers .
negative	the guy mentioned something about break and told me to come the next_day to the office and they will give me a new key , i came the following_day they simply gave_me the new key and acted_like nothing happened , they didn_'_t say why the doors and lockers were changed or why didn_'_t they notify me !!
negative	i was charged for an extra day in advance no refund .
negative	note_: when i checked my unit everything was there .
negative	i didn_'_t ask for refund for that day !
negative	took everything and left .
negative	staff were very friendly and professional !
negative	but i think they false advertise , the sign says $ 0 for the first month but it magically becomes $_00 when you go in : d
negative	i purchase a k_& n filter system for my f000 with missing hardware .

negative	a customer_support staff_member has replied to your support request , #_000000 with the following response :
negative	hello ,

negative	good afternoon ,

negative	the rotors came in 0 business days and look fine , but the ball_joints and brake_pads have yet to arrive and are way behind schedule !
negative	i ordered a clutch_master_cylinder for my 0000_honda_accord , the part came to me in a timely_manner but was no good .
negative	i took the part to a local shop to have it installed , the shop called me and told me the fitting bore was not correct and ended_up having to buy another master from a local parts house .
negative	the one i purchased from partsgeek turned_out to useless .
negative	received my eyeglasses and was appalled by the inaccurate / poor correction and / or fit :
negative	my vision was worsened by several degrees ( diopeters ) and i could not use the glasses at all .
negative	i searched the mailing contents and could not find any paperwork pertaining to the original order -
negative	none at all !
negative	just three promotional ads from selectspecs .
negative	so now i have no evidence whether the order was properly executed or mishandled .
negative	my trial at cheap glasses turned_out to be a complete fiasco / flop .
negative	would like to find out whose fault it could be theirs or mine .
negative	a bill of lading from the manufacturers could clarify .
negative	thanks for the possibility of feedback .
negative	your customer service sucks !
negative	the 0000 number on the billing information will not let you talk with someone and then it says goto our website but gives no website address !
negative	how stupid !
negative	then , if you do not receive a refund on your cancelled order that could take up to 00 days - call your credit_card company .
negative	what !
negative	i cannot_believe someone thinks a customer service company would even think about putting items like this in any communications with customers .
negative	it is very clear you are trying to figure how to rip customers off and blame it on someone_else .
negative	it was horrible don_'_t go on this site wrong part sent to you .
negative	ordered part . they shipped wrong part but i still had to pay shipping both_ways and wait 00 days for a refund . no_longer a partsgeek customer . several other more reputable places to order parts . worst part was after_contacting them they said i only had 0 options , reorder part and pay twice while waiting on refund or wait on refund and then reorder . well i had another option - go elswhere to get my parts .

negative	i ordered a bag of reflex all in one on the 00 st march and didn_'_t receive until the evening of the 0th_april .
negative	i ordered this with 0 - 0day delivery date .
negative	i '_m an ameture body_builder and planned to have arrive when my current supply ran_out .
negative	i wasn_'_t notified of any delay and to contact customer service for an update .
negative	this is the second time this has happened , last_year i ordered some cla which took a month to arrive .
negative	i '_m just going to use discount supplement from now on .
negative	i asked for 0kg of night protien , recieved 0 . 0kg of whey protien , im using the protien but sceptical_about ordering more if they cant get something this simple right .
negative	your collection of car was late on outward_journey , and on return collection was 00_mins .
negative	late and not where we were told the car was going to be , altogether a most unsatisfactory service , we shall not be using diamond parking again , but i must_say that the drivers were very pleasant .
negative	dropping the car off at_luton airport was a breeze , phoned telephone_number and explained we would be a bit early and this wasn_'_t a problem .
negative	gentleman waiting for us at designated drop_off point , paperwork done , off we go .
negative	return to luton after a lovely holiday at 0 am and wait for our bags ..
negative	bags collected time to call to arrange collection of our car ....
negative	call number and the telephone was off !!!!
negative	!
negative	kept calling and phone constantly off ...
negative	by this point it has_been 00_minutes and with 0 young_children and a 00 year_old i am getting very stresses .
negative	00_mins_later we manage to get through and are told your car will be 00_mins .
negative	we go to drop_off point and car finally arrives , upon asking what the problem was / why phones were switched off ...
negative	reply was " i '_m just a driver "!!
negative	!
negative	would i use again no !!!
negative	my heart couldn_'_t take it .
negative	it seems they can only ship clubs one way
negative	first , unlike_some others , i had shipping difficulties .
negative	the company spent 0 days " verifying " my address and another day packing for shipment .
negative	they missed the delivery date given at the time of order by several days .
negative	second , the packaging they used for camera lenses (!)
negative	is bubble - wrap in a paper envelop ; one of my lense boxes was damaged in transit , so i cannot return it for a full_refund .
negative	third , and most_importantly , for those buying nikon products this company is not an authorized_dealer .
negative	this means , for example , that you cannot qualify for the nikon extended 0 year lens warranty .
negative	shipped within 0 days part works_fine so_far
negative	on december 0st i signed_up for this service .
negative	i received a notification that an individual who i do not know with a female name was associated with my social_security number .
negative	i called your help line and was told not to worry_about it !
negative	i was billed on january_0th and received a notification on january_0th , today is february_0th and that was the last alert io have seen .
negative	i went to update me credit_score and it asked me if i wanted to charge $_00 or $_00 to my credit_card to receive it .
negative	i called the help line and was told to call back during regular business hours !
negative	what kind of company an i dealing_with ?
negative	i live 00_mins from the charlotte warehouse and they sent it to greensboro and back to kannapolis .
negative	then it sat there . for 0 days .
negative	i just don_'_t understand_why .
negative	im returning the part but im going to spend 00_mins instead of shiping , which would probably only take 0 day
negative	well , bought a one way ticket on short_notice for my brother in law to fly from ohio to seattle .
negative	but due to bad_weather , the flight got canceled .
negative	so after calling travelocity trying to get a refund , i had to break through the language_barrier because they outsource their customer_support .
negative	that took about five_minutes to explain to her , that it was bad_weather that canceled the flight and not me .
negative	and all i wanted was a refund .
negative	so then after she put me on hold , if you want to call it hold , more like , put the phone on table , yell to your boss and talk in foreign_language to try and figure_out what i really wanted .
negative	they told me i had to contact the airline .
negative	wow , thanks for wasting my time .
negative	so now i am waiting on a refund from the airline which they say will take 00 - 00 days to process , a refund which i may or may not get .
negative	thank_you for the confidence .
negative	item sent was wrong , another sent still wrong , both items returned ,
negative	ordered a dozen_roses for my partner at the beginning of the week , to be delivered yesterday ( valentines_day )
negative	i got an_email_saying that my order had been successfully delivered .. " great " i thought ...
negative	so i go home expecting to see a happy partner and some roses in a vase on the table ...
negative	i get there and there '_s nothing at all .
negative	i look at the tracking_info and it says the roses were " left in a safe place "
negative	my partner was in all day .. and if she wasnt , her disabled mum certainly was .
negative	i have rung iflorist and they '_ve put up a recorded_message_saying noone is available to take calls .
negative	i emailed last night and today and had no reply .
negative	monday_morning i shall commence chargeback with my credit_card company .
negative	avoid this company like the plague .
negative	i expect to hear of them going bust within the next month or so , as i don_'_t seem to be the only person they '_ve let_down on valentines_day .
negative	first they crapped themselves coz i paid via a different paypal email than my account email so had to wait almost 00_hours for a verification email .. then i had to install a different browser as in chrome i kept getting bad gateway error , then in new browser i had to pass mobile_phone_verification , then i finally got my cd_key that i paid the huge scary amazing sum of £ 0 for .
negative	they should concentrate less on their porn banners and more on improving their very amateur website and processing methods .
negative	shipped wrong part , different from picture .
negative	had to pay return postage .
negative	waiting for refund .
negative	i ordered a pair of prescription_ray_bans which i chased weekly and four weeks after_placing my order i was promised delivery then a note to say they had failed quality control for a small problem with the polarized lens so they would send me those and make a new pair .
negative	they didnt arrive when promised and the following_monday they were said to be ready for dispatch .
negative	not feeling confident i would ever get the perferct condition replacements i cancelled my order and am now waiting for my money back .
negative	dont use selectspecs unless you are prepared to wait a long time for your glasses
negative	to whom it may concern :
negative	poor service is not something that is generally sought .
negative	however , in hopes of providing a clear road map for success , one must first understand how to avoid failure .
negative	here is the partsgeek . com recipe for failure :
negative	0 .
negative	shift the blame : when the package arrived with only 0 of the 0 parts that i ordered , i called partsgeek . com .
negative	once i spoke to someone , there was never a sense of , " how can i make this right ," but rather , " how can we save face ?"
negative	consequently , there was a battery of questions about the package , when it arrived , how it looked .
negative	i come to find that it will take up to 00 days to resolve this claim and i must purchase the part again , and hope for a credit back .
negative	0 .
negative	buy as much time as possible on time - wasting processes : when i called the first time , i sat on hold for 00_minutes , until finally someone answered .
negative	i called two_days_later , and was on hold for 00_minutes before the phone system informed me , with some sort of automated message , that there was an , " extremely high_volume of callers " and to " please use the website to contact " the sales_team .
negative	i called again the next_day , twice .
negative	both_times on hold for 00 or more minutes .
negative	neither time did i did anyone answer .
negative	this left me with one option - use the website to send a message .
negative	the one time i did speak to someone , i was instructed to call fedex and file a claim .
negative	i did .
negative	i was told it would only take 0 days to resolve the claim and , if necessary , to remit payment to the sender for the lost item ( s ).
negative	so , 00 days after the payment is refunded action would be taken by partsgeek . com .
negative	0 .
negative	fail to follow in a timely_manner ( if at all ): the online issue reporting that is answered up to 00_hours_later - 0 days .
negative	i would fill_out the form , each time receiving a new " reference_number " that would only be tied back to the single message , not a chain of exchanges .
negative	i would get disjointed messages that ignored a subsequent request or inquiry .
negative	the latest was yesterday , i was told to have the box and product ready for pick - up , which of course never happened ( let '_s forget the fact that i had 0 of 0 parts , and i was now to send that 0 part back ).
negative	i had someone see that the box was prepared for pick_up , because i wasn_'_t not at home !
negative	regardless , nothing happened .
negative	0 .
negative	be great at sucking : i have been underwhelmed by the service partsgeek . com has provided on this encounter .
negative	from the general malaise of the " support " staff , to the lack of responsiveness to online questions , to the interminable wait times for telephone_calls ; partsgeek . com is great at sucking .
negative	you are welcome for this thorough analysis of your complaint resolution process .
negative	if this is read by anyone in a position of authority , you should appreciate the lessons that are presented here - and thank me .
negative	if you take offense and get defensive , you ' re missing ( yet another ) opportunity to get in front of a problem .
negative	i will give this a week to see how this is concluded from partsgeek . com , after which i will file for a chargeback , and hit the blogosphere with my message of disdain for partsgeek . com ..
negative	oh , and since the parts didn_'_t arrive , i am having to rent a car !!
negative	!
negative	thanks for setting the bar so low ..
negative	case far too tight ...
negative	the cord you use to pull it out scratches the bottom of my iphone ... not impressed
negative	atrocious customer service
negative	0 .
negative	they are 0 days late with a shipment ( i have a flight to leave the country for a few_months ) that is why i allowed for the extra day
negative	0 .
negative	i call their customer service and they say it will arrive a day earlier , just before my flight
negative	0 .
negative	i call ups and they say that the information i got was a lie and in no way would it get their the day before
negative	0 .
negative	i call them the say this and explain to them how angry i am for wasting my time and they don_'_t accept_responsibility for messing this up .
negative	in conclusion , their incompetence causes them to be two_days with a shipment , they waste hours of my time trying to fix their problem and they lie to me ....
negative	seriously .... wth is going on here ....
negative	i ordered a pair of glasses , the lenses i chose were to small for a progressive prescription i received an_email_stating as such then before i could respond they were shipped .
negative	needless to say i had to return them it cost me $_00 for shipping .
negative	reordered glasses , they were sent dhl , not priority post , they are now sitting in heathrow_airport .
negative	i started this whole_process in may it is now the end of august still no glasses , am i happy , not , will i use or recommend this company , never !!!
negative	!
negative	.... and then you want to charge me restocking_fees for returning the items .
negative	ridiculous !
negative	i was having_trouble booking a multi city ticket on line .
negative	i called and talked to a representative from travelocity .
negative	he was very polite and kept offering me different deals on tickets .
negative	before long he stated that my credit_card transaction would not go through .
negative	he had obligated my credit_card for almost ten thousand_dollars .
negative	every option he named he had booked .
negative	it took over two_weeks t get it straightened_out .
negative	by then the ticket price went up almost five hundred_dollars .
negative	the company offered no help or even an_apology for the time or money wasted !
negative	sincerely

negative	jeg_har_nu været i kontakt med modstroem og de_har_sendt den faktura der_ikke figurer blandt alle_de regninger jeg ellers har_fået fra firmaet inde på e_- boks .
negative	fremgangsmåden at de sender_en rykker 0 år efter uden at fortælle hvad_jeg
negative	skal_betale for , det lugter langt væk og ligesom alle_de andre exkunder vil_jeg hermed gerne advare evt kommende kunder om at jeg_er utilfreds .
negative	jeg_skal

negative	i ordered one item to try them out .
negative	they charged almost twice the price of the item for first_class_post .
negative	the item had not arrived after seven_days so i contacted them .
negative	in response i recieved a despach note and the item arrived three_days_later .
negative	at no point did i get an_apology so i will not use them again .

negative	da_jeg_skulle hente traileren var_der ingen de_havde ingen .
negative	og de 000_kr jeg_havde betalt i depositum fik_jeg heller_ikke tilbage .
negative	jeg_sendte to e_-_mails til a @ freetrailer . dk , men uden svar .
negative	tak for det .
negative	0 stjerne for den gode ide , men_det holder ikke helt i længden .
negative	this site took my money but has not delivered my product .
negative	i '_ve tried to reach them by phone multiple_times with no response .
negative	i '_ve left them a few voicemails , with no response and have also tried to contact them via_email - no response .
negative	i filed a claim against them with the better business_bureau , but haven_'_t heard_anything yet .
negative	so now , i '_ve contacted chase to reverse the charge and go after them .
negative	the parts that i ordered did not come in the same package or on the same day although the tracking_numbers on all the parts where the same i called and nobody would answer the phones even_though i waited one day on hold for over three hours .
negative	so i filled_out a customer_support_ticket and gave them my order number and they did not get back to me until four days_later .
negative	then they proceeded to ask me what the part numbers where for the parts i did not receive when i gave that info in the customer_support_ticket .
negative	later that day i received the rest of my order so i guess it all worked out but i thought great someone just took over three hundred_dollars that i paid them and i will never be able to get in contact with them all in all it was a bad_experience parts_geek needs to make their customer reps do thier jobs or hire new ones .
negative	i started out booking a room for $_00 . 00 .
negative	i went to register and the price jumps to 000 . 00 .
negative	tried to cancel and the damn site booked it , 000 . 00 for 0 days .
negative	i called and got it fixed i hope , wont know till mon .
negative	if it says 00 . 00 then jumps to 000 . 00 !
negative	really ?
negative	recieved broken part ( no packing_material in box ) tried to contact parts_geek . i got a refund minus shipping .
negative	if i want a new part i would have reorder .
negative	and pay shipping again . i will order another part , but not from parts_geek !
negative	thought id got a good deal .
negative	checked contract to ensure all insurance included .
negative	got back to find that an extra £_00 had been taken from my credit_card for 0 days hire .
negative	was told by holiday_autos that the extra was for cdw_insurance .
negative	so much for all_inclusive prices .
negative	in short they stink .
negative	my experience was after a change of plans i needed to cancel a hotel booking .
negative	tried their website but it wouldn_'_t let_me , said i was past the cancellation time , wasn_'_t .
negative	next tried their 000 customer service number , it had been disconnected , no new number provided .
negative	when back to their website and found another number .
negative	called that and it rang several minutes until i got a recorded_message_saying they were closed .
negative	gave up and called my cc company when i got home and put the charge into dispute .
negative	they had another number we called and got the run around for a full 00_minutes .
negative	cc company gave them three_days to fix their problem and issue a credit .
negative	the rep from the cc company was already familiar with them and has to deal frequently with problems related to this company .
negative	this company is part of expedia and i doubt i will be using them again as well .
negative	salesman tim was friendly , polite and informative .
negative	collection man brett again was great but we were assured we had enought diesel in the car to get us to the nearest garage and this was not the case .
negative	by the time we reached the dual carriage way immediately in front of the centre , the car was barely in motion , bunny hopping down the road , we ran_out of fuel on the roundabout .
negative	the garage mechanic was rude beyond_belief , and i quote " this is more than my jobs worth to bring fuel to you " and " i '_m doing you a favour !!".
negative	we eventually dragged out a meanlingless apology from the shift manager who made a bad situation worse with his atrocious manner and appalling attitude .
negative	item not in stock , wasted a whole week before i was notified .
negative	muffler was scrached and dinted all over and was not like it was pictured with a welded support from it to pipes on either end for support .
negative	cheap price but cheap product
negative	you advertisement on the website for the hilton was misleading .
negative	i take responsibility for not looking close enough .
negative	i was never told that you would deduct money from my account right_away .
negative	i was told by your agent that i had until 0 :_00pm to decide whether or not i would be staying at your hotel .
negative	i will make_sure never to use your service in the future .
negative	i was home all day on may 00 , 0000
negative	driver lied
negative	he said no one was here to receive the package
negative	now i have to wait_until may 00
negative	this order took more than one week
negative	i will never buy from you again
negative	please get back to me !!!!!!!!!

negative	will not be a future customer of partsgeek . com .
negative	we went with very high_hopes with the rembrantplein 0 apartment .
negative	for the amount of money we were paying we were expecting more of it .
negative	even the apartment description and photos miss guided us to fall for this rental .
negative	on june 00 i sent an_email to the apartment rental company as of today i haven_'_t heard_anything from them .
negative	on that email i stated that the sofa in the family room was dirty , dusty and with a bad smell , tv was not working .
negative	there was a broken iron board and we asked if they had an iron or can supply us with one ( no answer ).
negative	the windows has a bar that doesn_'_t allow you to open them .
negative	while i can understand this could be for safety so no one jumps from a second floor .
negative	that system poises a fire hazard as there is only one way to get out of the apartment .
negative	this could happen as under the apartment you have cafes and restaurants .
negative	the owners never said the amount of cigarette_smoke that comes from the restaurants to the apartment .
negative	it was bad to have a cigarette smelly apartment .
negative	in addition they didn_'_t mention we are next to a disco and on friday and saturday nite you can hear the boom boom of the music in the bedrooms until 0 or 0am .
negative	we wrote the email explaining all these matters and we would had expect at_least an answer and probably a discount for not being honest on the condition of the apartment .
negative	so , anyone going to amsterdam invest your money in another apartment this one is a steal and the rental company really doesn_'_t care bout giving you service .
negative	they just want your money .
negative	reseller ratings allows people to post reviews about your company , even if they have never done business with you .
negative	if you want to respond to a negative_review ... guess what ?
negative	you have to join and pay $_00 per_month to post a response to the review .
negative	they allowed someone to post a review about my company after i cancelled their order , due to a fraud_alert .
negative	don_'_t waste your money buying from this joint .
negative	shady to say the least !
negative	if you have a return forget it , you '_ll stay on their recorded tech line forever with no one even attempting to answer .
negative	i listened to their recording for over an_hour before hanging up .
negative	this was after their customer service agent told me there were just 0 calls ahead of me , and that they had 0 techs on duty .
negative	have purchased cameras , alarms , and other stuff from them for my 0 homes but never again !
negative	below is the content of an_email i sent yesterday to selections .
negative	" this order was delivered last friday .
negative	no one was in and the courier left it up against the front_door which is completely_unacceptable .
negative	if we had been on holiday , it would have been an invitation to burglars .
negative	the packaging was poorly taped up – just a bit of sellotape – and was holed in places .
negative	i opened it today .
negative	the product is the poorest quality i have ever_seen .
negative	there is at_least one piece missing .
negative	several of the pre_- assembled pieces are falling_apart .
negative	i tried to screw them back together but the wood is of such poor quality that it cannot hold the screws .
negative	i did not bother to assemble the product as i doubt it would hold a bunch of feathers , never mind dozens of apples .
negative	putting two and two together , i imagine this may have been delivered to several people before ( hence the state of the packaging ) and they also had the sense to send it back .
negative	0 .
negative	i am not about to change my billing_address ; that would cause un - necessary problems for me .
negative	0 .
negative	i do not have this problem with other merchants ; check it out .
negative	0 .
negative	assuming you did ship to my billing_address , would you be responsible if the carrier left the item on my door_step and it was stolen ?
negative	the last incident left me $_00 . 00 poorer .
negative	0 .
negative	in a snide way , you assume i stole someone '_s identity and was trying to cash in .
negative	i don_'_t need your insult .
negative	0 .
negative	you just lost a customer .
negative	went to rent a unit .
negative	00_%_off first two months .
negative	not .
negative	plus i had to get insurance .
negative	almost doubled my rent .
negative	we can to mallorca island off the coast of spain to enjoy our last_week of vacarion before heading back home .
negative	our expirence renting a car with auro europe was so horrible that it nearly ruined the end of our trip .
negative	the woman at the desk was incredibly rude and forced us into purchasing insurance packages that we did not need just because we were young with the threat that she would charge my card to 0000 euro and hold the money if i did not buy the added insurance .
negative	we only needed a car to get us to our hotel which was 00km away and the car are already been rented online prior to us flying to the island .
negative	i will never rent from this company again and will_certainly not tell anyone to use auto_europe when traveing abroad .
negative	they sent me the wrong part and have still not contacted me to resolve the situation .
negative	i would call them , but they don_'_t have a phone_number , how convenient .
negative	their return_policy is horrible so i '_m not expecting much when they do call .
negative	if the situation is resolved to my satisfaction then i will change my rating .
negative	package was meant to be delivered before_noon service and it still_hasn_'_t been delivered now and its 0pm , spoke to the customer_services 0 times without and any more information or mention of some kind of a refund , one girl denise did offer a part refund for good faith , which i would be amazed if i was to receive this over the coming weeks , just hope the package is delivered tomorrow sometime .
negative	i had to spend 0 calls from africa which cost me a small_fortune to still not get any answers .
negative	if there is manager who would want to call me on 0000000000000 feel free , if pigs can fly !!
negative	!
negative	i ordered a game at the same time as a friend who was around my house and they refused to send me my copy unless i gave them a copy of my id and rather_than refunding me so i could buy from steam only £_00 more ... they said i had to email them and wait a few_days for them to bother processing a refund the guy on support just kept saying the same thing over and over and was not any help at all .
negative	none of my friends will be using them again and nor will i do your self a faviour pay a little extra and save_yourself the grief !
negative	company is horrible , i placed an order on 0 / 00 and my cc was charged .
negative	i believed the filters were in stock and would ship right_away , i was wrong .
negative	i contacted them 0 times via phone , always got automated_response to leave message which i did , no response .
negative	i then sent several emails with the same , no response .
negative	finally used their live_chat on 0 / 00 .
negative	they gave some lame excuses that the filters were out of stock and would ship by the end of the week , which i did not believe .
negative	i asked for a full_refund which they said they would issue , we will see .
negative	this easily would have been resolved by responding or letting customers know if the filters are not in stock .
negative	hope you feel good about the freight charge ... it was more than the product ... last time i shop with you .
negative	i booked and had confirmation of the fit hotel in nyc and when i arrived they had no knowledge of my reservation and they were full .
negative	they said they had turned away 0 other people who had bookings through hostelbookers because they hadnt received anything in terms of a reservation .
negative	while the company '_s terms state check with the property , and they deny any liabilty , i would question why use them in the first place .
negative	if i had arrived late at night this would have been extremely dangerous .
negative	just google the hostelbookers . com reviews and you '_ll see there is a pattern here .......
negative	as a frequent customer , i made a purchase from this site for some parts .
negative	( 0 parts total ) this company had taken the funds out from my bank and had canceled my order .
negative	after 0 days of trying to file a dispute with my bank and trying to reach this company over the phone to demand my refund was absolutely pointless .
negative	nothing but an_automated machine that puts you on hold for 00_minutes or so and then says " no one is avail .
negative	right now , goodbye " too bad i cant give this horrible company 0_stars .
negative	after three_attempts calling and waiting 00_minutes , i finally connected with a representative .
negative	we talked about the part i needed and he insured me that the part would work .
negative	i thought great until it came .
negative	it was not the right part and it would definitely not fit .
negative	i called back only to wait , wait , wait .
negative	finally , after reaching a representative and explaining the situation , he checked and informed me that the original salesperson who took my order was no_longer with the company .
negative	they are a rip_off .
negative	i will never use this site again and have already spoken to others regarding this . site ..
negative	heaven help you if you make one mistake and try to have it remedied ... good luck !
negative	item was shown to be in stock , i was given a delivery date , then at the last_minute was told that in fact it was out of stock , and would i re - order in 0_weeks .
negative	no hope !
negative	frames_direct sent me the wrong glasses , so i returned them .
negative	but i had to pay $_00 to ship them back , and they kept $_00 from me , so i '_m out $_00 .
negative	save your money , just go to a store .
negative	horrible service .
negative	pick your phone up .
negative	tell me to call before sending back .
negative	the wait time plus being transferred from one rep to the next was extremely annoying .
negative	i was glad to get hole in one plaque , but when i opened an undamaged box , i found the corner of the plaque damaged .
negative	i will call monday 0 - 00 - 0000
negative	i was out of town and parked my car here for a weekend .
negative	when i returned i discovered that a pickup_truck had parked right behind me , blocking my car in !
negative	and i was not the only person !
negative	there were literally a dozen other cars that this happened to .
negative	i had to literally wait for them to move the car .
negative	i get that this place is cheap but come on .
negative	i also don_'_t feel_like the place was very safe to leave my car .
negative	overall i ' d say just spend the extra money and park at the airport .
negative	i bought a warranty for my ipod about a year_ago .
negative	my ipod broke and i took it in to bestbuy .
negative	they said they wouldnt replace my ipod .
negative	after arguing with them they said the terms have since changed from when i bought the replacement plan .
negative	what a bunch of phonys !
negative	i think this was a problem with the hotel in india not you .
negative	but .....
negative	i t caused me a lot of time , money and stress to correct it .
negative	calling switzerland , india and hong_kong to correct .
negative	forcing me also to find a much more_expensive alternative at the last_minute .
negative	not a good experience at all
negative	i still have open inquieries to missing parts .
negative	i have yet to hear back from customer service .
negative	there is no phone_number to call and talk to anyone .
negative	just poor communication .
negative	sincerly , steve newkirk
negative	the parts that i purchased upon installation they were determine bad .
negative	a problem t ticket was open and a fax was send but to may regret i had not received a response .
negative	the ticket was open on 00 / 00 / 0000 and the fax sent on 00 / 00 / 0000 and nothing .
negative	i will never buy from this site again .
negative	you fucks didn_'_t include clips with the wheel well liner .
negative	what the fuck ?
negative	by the way how do i call your company ?
negative	?
negative	staff not nice they are very rude and disrespectful
negative	size not true
negative	worst company i '_ve ever_dealt_with customer service is terrible constantly phoning them up as they don_'_t reply to e_-_mails an then had the cheek to offer 00_%_discount a second time .
negative	my advice is don_'_t use them they ' re only going to rip you off .
negative	i was called on my cell_phone 0d ago fri by a moderately accented representative who was anxious for me to approve the second leg of the trip to philadelphia since united cancelled my booked flight cleveland - philadelphia .
negative	i resisted and called back sat and was told by the rep that she could not get thru to the airline , to call back on mon .
negative	today ( mon ) i explained that the connection time in cleveland was reduced from 0hr 00min to 00 min was not acceptable .
negative	i suggested to cancel the indianapolis - cleveland trip and book a usair indianapolis - philadelphia flight .
negative	i got disconnected after a 00 min on phone and now received a e_-_mail simply cancelling the cleveland - philadelphia leg .
negative	now i have to call back - this sucks .

negative	i ordered a part , which was advertised on the parts_geek website , to fit my vehicle .... when i recieved the part i discovered the part does not fit my vehicle , because on the box it clearly_states the vehicles that the part fits , and my . vehicle was not . listed .... this was verified when i called . the manufacturer of . the product .... the part was advertised . incorreectly .... i . am in . the process of returning it however i already anticipate problems becaudeparts geek wants me to pay to have it shipped back , and thats not . happening

negative	they took the order without the item in stock and never informed me .
negative	after couple of weeks when i inquired , they asked me to wait for some more time .
negative	i waited for another couple of weeks before cancelling the order .
negative	they are not refunding the money .
negative	i am still_waiting .. seems like a big scam to cheat people who don_'_t check their credit_card statements .
negative	trolls are everywhere !
negative	very misleading !
negative	i bought the key because cjs_cd_keys said i could play the game instantly .
negative	i activated the key in origin and it says i now have to wait_until tomorrow .
negative	if i had to wait i would have bought the psychical copy for half the price of this download key .
negative	i feel mislead & ripped_off .
negative	never again !
negative	code didn_'_t work .
negative	still no reply to my emails .
negative	i had a terrible experience with this company and will use them again .
negative	they never shipped my order , and then when i tried to contact them nobody_answers the phone .
negative	i like to resolve_issues with a live_person not by email .
negative	do not use these_people because you will never get your parts !!!!!!
negative	try autozone . com or advanced_auto . com they even give a discount and free shipping for online purchases .
negative	i ordered a radiator for my truck from parts_geek .
negative	when it showed_up the box was in perfect_condition .
negative	when i opened the box the next_day to replace my old radiator with the new .
negative	the new one sent by parts_geek was damaged it was bent in i can '_t install a bent radiator .
negative	so what do i do i file a support claim i get no response .
negative	i try calling 00 times no response , i filled_out 0 more support tickets no response .
negative	i shouldn_'_t have to pay to send back a part i received damaged .
negative	its damaged so that they deliberately must have sent me a damaged part .
negative	either way this is rediculous all i want to do is exchange the part for a brand_new one and there is no communication .
negative	i will never do_buisness with them again and i will spread the word of how awful they are if this doesn_'_t get resolved .
negative	i reserved a car and arrived a few hours after my reservation began only to see that my selected car wasn_'_t available .
negative	i had to get a different car that was ~$ 00 more per day which ended_up being about $_000 more total for my rental period .
negative	plus i was told that i " would save a bit because it '_s a diesel and diesel gas was cheaper ".
negative	diesel was at_least 0p more per liter .
negative	thanks , guys .
negative	do not ever make a reservation with reservation_counter .
negative	they charge your card without authorization & when you try to resolve any_issues , you can not get in touch with anyone to assist you !
negative	i was on hold for over a half_hour with the number they provide , so i hung_up .
negative	i sent an e_-_mail over 0 hours ago & they have yet to respond .
negative	this was the worst hotel i have ever stayed in .
negative	who charges over a hundred a night for a room with no fridge .
negative	the cable didn_'_t work .
negative	and the room key failed about five times .
negative	had to get it replaced so much they sent someone to change lock an that still didn_'_t work .
negative	they made me wait in room for almost_half a day before someone could show up .
negative	very bad_experience .
negative	sales_person would not provide us with requested information but pushed only his hotel .
negative	very aggressive .
negative	would not listen to needs of customer .
negative	dont use this company ordered wireless panasonic for rear speakers in april received eventually in june after chasing them
negative	every week . after setting them up found not to work have emailed
negative	and phoned but still_awaiting reply staff very unhelpful and disinterested worst customer experience ever and no end in sight
negative	the base is about 0 inches_shorter than the greenhouse and there were no fixing stakes as per the instructions .
negative	as an aside , we were quite shocked by what we received as a base as it cost £_00 . 00 and we estimate we could have bought the wood ourselves for about £_00 .
negative	the greenhouse is less_than 00 feet long .
negative	the instructions on the glazing panels indicate that they need to be closed at each end with tape .
negative	there is nothing in the greenhouse instructions about this so not sure what to do here .
negative	contacted garden buildings direct and got a simple cut and paste answer about checking whether the parts were all there .
negative	realized a purchase of products , and have not received them .
negative	the items listed are not enrolled in the brazilian post_office .
negative	the website of dhl , not in sending the item from the united_states yet , so i wonder where my products .
negative	ordered 0 hp00 and they dont fit
negative	total rubbish
negative	i chose lenses that were supposed to be a match for specsavers lenses .
negative	i copied all the details straight off the box from specsavers .
negative	the lense on the left clings to my eyeball like a limpit .
negative	arrived the day before my camping holiday , and spoilt it .
negative	don_'_t bother !
negative	your website and an_email message you sent me had contradicting information about when my order would be delivered .
negative	when i telephoned your company i told them the delivery date was unacceptable .
negative	they said they would issue me a refund .
negative	but imagine my disappointment when the item arrived even_though it was suppose to be cancelled .
negative	this is a very poor way to do_business and i am very unhappy .
negative	ordered 0 . 0lb of choc carnivore and 00 servings of sizeon order came out to $_00 with a $ 0 cupon , so i price matched with a another site called xxlmass . com and they said they couldnt match that price .
negative	so i matched it with total nutrition warehouse and they couldnt match that price .
negative	total nutrition had free shipping and actually saved me $_00 on my order !
negative	very , very disappointed with my latest order .
negative	the grant steering_wheel , kit and horn were all listed in stock .
negative	after 0_weeks for one item and two_weeks for the other item i placed a call to cust service .
negative	i was informed that " in stock " does not mean you have the item , and many are shipped from the supplier / manufacuturer .
negative	my frustration is two fold , one , you charged my credit_card and two , grant does not have any of the parts in stock , and , the back order is going to result in an be april ship date .
negative	also , on my first call to 0wd_hardware i was told i should have the items the week of 0 / 0 / 0000 .
negative	sumitt never charges for items not in stock .
negative	your customer service team is not rude , but your business_practice leaves a bit to be desired .
negative	this company has cheap high_quality products but there service suck @ ss .
negative	i ordered an item and the website said it was in stock , but it was never actually in stock i and paid for overnight delivery .
negative	one item was delivered but other item was out of stock so it never shipped .
negative	when i called to ask if i was still gonna be charged for over night delivery on the second item the owner deleted the backordered item without askin me if i still wanted it and hung_up on me .
negative	called back twice to ask a question and was hung_up on twice more .
negative	this company does not deserve customers so dont order from them
negative	i couldn_'_t type my corrected information in several areas - finally i started over and typed it all in manually .
negative	auto fill was bad - info in the wrong boxes couldn_'_t be changed .

negative	i just received a package from restockit which was from an order placed with amazon . com .
negative	it is a desk blotter that arrived damaged .
negative	and , no wonder , because it was sent in a flimsy carton , with no inside packaging , not even a plastic_cover .
negative	so , when the carton got damaged , so did the contents .
negative	i will avoid ever using this company again .
negative	i placed ( my first order ) with them on 0 / 00 .
negative	a week_later the product had still not arrived .
negative	i forgot about it over the weekend and on monday , 00 days_later , i emailed asking where the product might be .
negative	i was sent a reply that my card was declined .
negative	so i wrote back and asked why i hadn_'_t been informed immediately so i could have taken_care of it on the 00th .
negative	they said i should have received a reply , which i did not , as all that i received was an_email thanking_me for my order .
negative	there was no " we ' re sorry " for the inconvenient waiting period , just that i should start the order over .
negative	i did , with another company that beat their price by $ 0 . 00 .
negative	i bought 0 maximuscle progain extreme from affordable supplements and they arrived in the delivery time they told me but the box given to me only contained 0 tub of the product .
negative	i have rang up and complained and demanded the rest of my paid for product and they '_ve told me i must write a formal_complaint for either their own fault or the courier '_s fault .
negative	i '_ve paid £_000 for 0 tub of progain in which i should have recieved 0 .
negative	i don ; t feel the need for me to make an effort to recieve the products i have paid a lot of money for for someone_elses fault or someone stealing the product from either inside their own company or the couriers company .
negative	if nothing is done about this matter i will be taking further legal_action .
negative	i was very disappointed in the customer service and the extremely long wait time once i finally received the merchandise it was too small , with it being a custom order there is no way to exchange or return .
negative	i think i will look else where for someone to fulfill the orders for our event .
negative	i have the following complaint :
negative	0 .
negative	the order has arrived in two shipments and i could not find out on your tracking_system .
negative	it made me wonder_whether it was a wrong shipment when i received your first shipment .
negative	i sent your a question and you told me to wait for the second .
negative	0 .
negative	the pcv_valve was not suitable for my car such that pressure built up in the engine that oil came out from the dipstick tube .
negative	i never doubt about the part was wrong and i tried to check on all other possibilities .
negative	i have to buy one at o ' reilly to replace yours .
negative	the part was cheap but it has created a lot of trouble for me .

negative	after_speaking with a person named , mario , miami beach customer service , i found i was misinformed on total price of room ( tax addition was not explained ) and , also , the terms of sale ( no refund possible ).
negative	i specifically told mario i want to have the option to change my reservation on a future date .
negative	he told me i would be able to change until the day i check in .
negative	wrong information !
negative	after i reviewed the confirmation e_mail ( no refund stated ), along with reviewing my bank_account , not only was the no refund clause added to the confirming e_mail , but the amount of my room reservation was deducted from my bank_account immediately , may 0 , 0000 ..
negative	reservation #_000000000 , dated may 0 , 0000 .
negative	i wasted 0 hour dealing_with the following people in your organization : mario , bridget , louie , and finally bryana , miami and honduras customer service locations .
negative	suggestion , train your people before they attempt to accept reservations .
negative	i realize i '_m 0 consumer of your product , but if you want to increase revenue , training is badly needed .
negative	also , have your customer service reps begin the conversation with customers by telling them you ' re an independent booking agency with corporate offices ( utah ) with no affiliation with the hilton corporation .

negative	i wouldnt return to your business if you begged me .
negative	i received a very nice letter which i copied 00_hours after_placing my order .
negative	0 - 0 business days money will be refunded .
negative	well i not holding my breath cause it ain '_t come to fruition .

negative	my bank_account was hit right after dealing_with your site .
negative	you need help in business protection computer systems .
negative	i '_m not coming_back .
negative	i am not alone in noticing the appalling decline in levels of assistance provided to people , particularly elderly , who need assistance when disembarking at_heathrow .
negative	this , if one looks on the internet , is due to many of the services in heathrow being outsourced to a company called “ omniserv ”, the european arm of “ airserv corporation ”.
negative	interestingly enough , i have been unable to find any positive_reviews of this company .
negative	i will write to them , but i fully expect the to receive a version of the anodyne statements from management that are typical of modern organisations with overpaid pr departments and underpaid staff – such as the company mission '_s statement :
negative	" we are a ' people company ' and have always believed a satisfied customer is the result of well valued and rewarded members of staff ."
negative	- ernest patterson , chairman , omniserv ltd
negative	on several_occasions my 00 year_old mother , who when arriving at_heathrow business class , was only met after a 00 minute delay , was then shunted to a waiting area with 00 other passengers , where she would have had to wait another 00_minutes while the 0 or so staff actually working shuffled mobility challenged passengers through immigration and customs .
negative	fortunately , she can walk with difficulty , and managed to make her way , but i did find it quite disturbing to have her burst into tears when i met her .
negative	this is in complete contrast to services as they used to be , and the care and attention given her by air_canada .
negative	her complaints to air_canada were met with incredible sympathy and sadness because the ground crew meeting passengers was no_longer connected to the airline .
negative	unfortunately , we don ’ t have a choice of service when we arrive at_heathrow .
negative	i will write to heathrow , omniserv , and in order to escalate the process , my local mp , panorama and various newspapers who thrive on exposing dodgy disrespectful business_practices .

negative	this company is worse than crap .
negative	i am sure the positive_reviews have all been paid for through a company in belize .
negative	ordered three disks $ 0 , 000 - sent by pony express from california , incorrectly filled_out address form so couldn_'_t have them redirected to a different address .
negative	created 00 support tickets , eventually spoke to an equivocal employee who said he would check with his_supervisor - no response was forthcoming , and today still no joy .
negative	their restocking policy is 00_% charge - ridiculous .
negative	still no joy - after over a month .
negative	they have started answering my emails since this review has_been posted .
negative	excellent products but brutal insensitive refund policy - will only exchange .
negative	bought vest for my father who passed_away before he could wear them .

negative	i order a part 00 days ago .
negative	no follow_up or notification since receiving email stated my credit_card went through .
negative	i have not received the order .
negative	going back on the site it states order is being_processed .
negative	i can not reach them by phone .
negative	very frustrating .
negative	i would not recommend them .
negative	i ordered 0 items , one for $_00 and one for $_00 .
negative	i received the $_00 dollar item in less_than a week , but i never got the $_00 dollar item .
negative	i checked the tracking and both items had the same tracking_number , but there no way it was shipped in the same box because the box was too small for the second item .
negative	i filled_out a complaint form online and received an_email 0 days_later stating that they would be shipping out " another " part as a replacement .
negative	that was about a week_ago and i have not seen the part .
negative	i have since already bought another part locally to do the work .
negative	so , if the part ever shows up , it will be returned .

negative	mhw were very slow to respond to my emails .
negative	when i asked them to send me replacement wheels they said this would take 0_weeks .
negative	i asked them to send me wheels from stock bikes that they had in store but they would not do this .
negative	it has_been almost 0_weeks now and no sign of the wheels and mhw are not responding to my emails .
negative	amazing that when i enquired_about buying a bike they would email back within 0 minutes but when you have a problem they seem to dissapear .

negative	cube bikes have been no help either , they just told me to contact the dealer i bought from
negative	i return the unused tickets and even_though they confirm they received the envelope in good condition , they say some tickets were missing .
negative	this is despite numerous_emails to confirm i put them in the envelope myself in front of my partner who witnessed everythng .
negative	using logic ... i explained i put the tickets in the envelope , the envelope was posted to trainline , they admit receiving the envelope in good condition , this means any tickets that are missing must have been mishandled / lost at the trainline office .
negative	the floor manager said " we don_'_t follow logic ".
negative	which says it all really .
negative	i won_'_t be using trainline in future and i am seeking legal advice in this matter .
negative	in reply to trainline ...
negative	i can personally guarantee all the tickets were in the envelope and this was witnessed by my partner .
negative	i did sent the envelope special delivery and you did receive the the envelope .
negative	becuase i know all the tickets were in the envelope when i posted it and trainline admit recieving the envelope in good condition , by process of elimination and logic , any missing tickets must have been lost after delivery .
negative	very little if any customer service
negative	my order has_been refunded with no_explanation
negative	while i am sitting around waiting for the thing to show up
negative	too high of a call_volume to answer the phone - you suck

negative	i '_ve shopped here twice but not again .
negative	the first time i purchase a blower_motor and it was the wrong one but was able to find the right one on ebay because they showed a picture of the item .
negative	plus i had to pay to ship the wrong one back to partsgeek .
negative	the second time i was sent the wrong shocks and wanted me to call the dealership for them to get the oem # so they could exchange them which i did and i '_m still_waiting for their results .
negative	i will not use them again .
negative	i do not trust their delivery service .
negative	the contents arrived smashed to splinters not just broken .
negative	i emailed to complain and they wanted photos and more trouble than it was worth .
negative	who ever delivered these thoroughly abused the order .
negative	again i reiterate that i was excited about the offer but when the product arrived it did not work in my computer printer
negative	when i arrived in london at the national rent a car , i was told that i had to buy the insurance in order to rent the car .

negative	overall review
negative	" do not buy from poolproducts0less . com or be disappointed .
negative	i have received a lot of valuable info from these forums and wanted to pass on some of my own .
negative	i order parts for my hayward pool_cleaner from them because they were the cheapest .
negative	( 0st mistake ) now i know why .
negative	no customer service at all .
negative	they do not answer their phones or return messages .
negative	they may answer their sales line .
negative	when printed my receipt i notice my mailing_address was off by 0 number which would be 0 houses down if that address existed .
negative	i tried to contact them to correct it but they don_'_t answer .
negative	you would think if the shipping address is different than billing_address their system would have rejected my order .
negative	when i was able to tracked my package it said it was delivered .
negative	i called the post_office they were no help .
negative	i spoke to my post man and he remembers the package and said their was no name on it .
negative	i have received items before with the wrong_address , my postman knows me .
negative	i am not getting any help from poolproducts0less . com i will not order from them again and urge you not to order also .
negative	this was my experience with poolproducts0less . com ""
negative	this is the second drive axle i had to order from parts_geek .
negative	the first one was damaged in shipment .
negative	i had to pay shipment back to them .
negative	the second one i ordered came without_any internal structural packaging .
negative	it was just free to flop around in the carton .
negative	poor quality of shipment .
negative	should i be concerned_about the part that took me so much time to put on ?
negative	i have one start because it wouldn_'_t let_me give zero_stars .
negative	the service was horrible .
negative	first of the whole_process took way to long i . poked on the phone and it took almost 0 0 / 0 hours to book my vacation .
negative	the lady couldn_'_t offer me any transportation from the airport to my hotel and i '_m pretty sure she booked me into the wrong airport .
negative	then she asked me if i was the insurance on the flight which i declined well she charged me for this anyways which i caught right_away since i got an_email and it charged my bank_account so i told her this and she said she would fix it i still a week_later have not received my credit for this error .
negative	then i sent up my hotel on pay delay and instead she charged for the whole trip well my account only had the money for approved about i authorized so i got a fee from my bank .
negative	once i noticed this i call bookit and told them what happened and that it was fine i would pay the whole trip i just wanted the insurance and fee back .
negative	i was then told someone would call me back between 00 - 00_hrs to help me with this .
negative	this was 0 days ago simple math shows it has_been more than 00_hrs .
negative	i will never use book it ever again .
negative	the worst company ever with people who have no_clue what they are doing .
negative	after making a purchase , i was left a voicemail by a random pa number from giftcards . com .
negative	i tried_calling back only for it to go to a fax_number .
negative	i called the regular customer service number at 0 ish on a friday for me to be told that the department i needed to talk with left early , and always leaves early on fridays .... an entire " department "!
negative	anyways , i ended_up getting my order cancelled after a few_days and went to a different gift_card reseller and got my results within minutes .
negative	the delivery driver broke the lockcatch to our tank .
negative	now i have to find an estimate for a replacement lock and send it to team flitwick for it to be agreed and then wait for it to arrive .
negative	meanwhile i have no lock on the tank and we have had oil thefts in our village .
negative	team flitwick - i am not impressed !
negative	my experience :
negative	after spending a considerable_amount of time comparing parts , locating parts , and placing the order required to complete the repair my automobile was in need of i received an_email indicating that the parts would not be shipped because the shipping address was different from the billing_address .
negative	i attempted to go to the website in order to find a phone_number , from which , i could call to correct the issue .
negative	there was none , at_least in an easily_accessible place .
negative	i was then left with no other option except that of submitting an online help ticket .
negative	upon submission i received an_email explaining that i must wait two_days for a response to be received .
negative	finally on the second day i logged in to find an_email_telling_me that a representative from parts_geek had attempted to call me but , received no answer so , a message was left .
negative	either this was false or my phone did not receive a missed call or voicemail .
negative	however , they did follow this statement asking for my phone_number and availability so that someone from the company could contact me .
negative	i supplied them with this information and expected a phone_call to straighten the matter out .
negative	again , no call .
negative	an_email was then sent indicating that i could call the company at my convenience and speak to a representative about my order .
negative	seemingly a reversal of the aforementioned company representative contacting me .
negative	nevertheless i acquiesced in making the phone_call ; as finally i had a phone_number , 0 week_later .
negative	no human_being ever picked_up the phone and the system kicked me off without letting_me leave a message .
negative	i am now receiving a request for this review with the statement " thank_you for your recent_purchase from partsgeek . com ".
negative	well .......
negative	your welcome partsgeek . com .
negative	when will i be receiving my parts ?
negative	the appalling disconnected nature of the business is no_doubt the result of leveraging technological resources to replace human_beings and drive down cost significantly .
negative	a sad cost of the age we live in but , it was not a computer that lied about calling me and leaving a message and then upon asking for and receiving my availability / phone_number failed to ever follow_up and call me back again .... or maybe it was .
negative	just in case it is not clear : i have never received my parts , it has_been 0_weeks , no further communication has_been attempted to resolve ,.
negative	at_least they were nice enough not to withdrawal the payment prom my account .
negative	worst customer service i experienced in 00 years .
negative	they just transfer your order to a real parts house to fill .
negative	i am very disappointed with your customer service , first of all the only way you can get any response is through emails , and they respond after several days .
negative	when i placed the order for my car struts i accidently typed in the wrong zip_code , for four days i was calling that customer service line you have , each time i waited for 00_minutes , 00_minutes !!!
negative	, in the four times i called no representative ever answered , that '_s ridiculous , on top of that the same music played , you do the math i waited a total of 00_minutes .
negative	i emailed you guys twice and only received one email back and this is what it said
negative	" hello i do apologize i can not make any changes at this time .
negative	here is your tracking details ."
negative	all i understood from this email is " i don_'_t care , that '_s your mistake , your problem ."
negative	i didn_'_t need them to email me the tracking details i could easily find them on the ups website , i wanted someone to change the zip_code .
negative	i called ups they told me that you guys the senders had to call them and request the zip_code to be changed , ups said after that no matter where the shipment they could change the shipping_label .
negative	i sent you another email with this information since i could never talk to a representative , and i never received an_email back .
negative	i waited anxiously for that package and it was fustrating thinking the package wasn_'_t going to make it and that i would lose $_000 .
negative	thankfully ups informed me that since the address and city were right the machine sometime prints out the shipping_label with the correct zip_code , and thank_god the struts made it to my house .
negative	my car both front_struts are changed and my car feels_like new , your prices and product are 0_star , but your customer service suck s not even worthy of any star at all .
negative	you guys really need to improve your customer service , or soon you will lose customers , we like to be appreciated and helped , and you guys at parts_geek should know that
negative	i ordered a chicken house approximately 0 and half weeks_ago .
negative	at the time i was told that i could expect the product to arrive in approximately 0_weeks .
negative	my credit_card was charged for the full price of the product and for postage at the time of order ( over £_000 ).
negative	nothing has arrived and the company has_been completely unresponsive to emails and the phone line is always busy or unattended .
negative	don_'_t spend more than you are willing to lose with this company .
negative	this place canceled my order for no reason and held my money for 0_weeks , i promise u should go spend ur money at a local parts store
negative	part was descripted wrong and i '_m now stuck_paying to send it back .
negative	not happy
negative	thanks for doubeling my order .
negative	it will_certainly be my last .
negative	beware if they ship you a bad part they will not take back unless you can magically prove it is bad .
negative	they don_'_t want to help but they will call you for a week straight trying to get you to change your review to good .
negative	part did not work and i can '_t return it .
negative	my $_00 part became $_000 plus the $_00 .
negative	good luck !
negative	while everything fit okay , it didn_'_t seem to correct my posture in the least .
negative	i purchased 0kg coconut cream diet_whey and when it arrived the seal was broken and powder had been lost i brought this up with them and i was told that this was not their fault .
negative	i wont be buying from here again as i have just wasted about 00 pound .
negative	customer service is unacceptable
negative	i ordered a part , it came poorly_packed .
negative	i gave them a second try and i got the wrong part so they refunded my money and let_me keep that part i dont_know why !
negative	slow responses through email so yeah i do not recommend them
negative	ordered a part that came up under my search vehicle but it also sid " to include " another model .
negative	( i have a sr0 part came up to include ltd ) turns_out it was not to " include " my vehicle and that '_s my fault .
negative	they stopped returning my emails after i called them on their wording .
negative	and i am expected to pay return shipping .
negative	ordered 0 bar_stools on tuesday 00st jan .
negative	checked my account on saturday 0th feb to see that they hadn_'_t been dispatched yet .
negative	telephoned but there was no answer so wrote an_email enquiring when they would be disptached .
negative	received a very brief email back on sunday_evening " hi , this order was refunded as we where out of stock .
negative	we did email you to advise of this .
negative	sometimes spam filters will delete our emails ".
negative	not sure about the spam_filter explanation because i received a confirmation_email and an_email_asking me to leave this review .
negative	i requested further information_regarding when the refund had been made and was told friday 0rd .
negative	i didn_'_t receive the money back into my account until tuesday 0th feb .
negative	the communication from lakeland furniture has_been very poor .
negative	on checking their website i noticed the stools i ordered are still showing as in stock .
negative	soweit ist bei ebookers alles ok . bin aber als eher seehr guter kunde ( manitu @ bluewin . ch ) extrem " sauer " auf_die geschäftspolitik .
negative	sollte es zum beispiel um eine rückerstattung oder eine reklamation gehen , gibt sich ebookers sehr verschlossen und blockt mit_einem standartschreiben und " wimmelt " einem ab .
negative	auf keinen fall irgend in einer form etwas zurückerstatten .
negative	hauptsache die kasse klingelt .
negative	ich_habe in letzter zeit wirklich nur das nötigste bei ebookers bestellt .
negative	zum glück gibt_es auch andere möglichkeiten um an flüge und hotels zu gelangen .
negative	offenbar sind ebookers kunden nicht wirklich wichtig .

negative	gave myself plenty of time to order some parts for my truck considering im going on a trip and needed these parts .
negative	when checking on the shipping status , i discovered they were sent to a totally different state .
negative	now my trip is in a week and a half and no parts !!
negative	how this happened i have no_idea and when calling to find out ... there is no customer service .
negative	not a happy_camper here .
negative	praying i can get these parts soon , but looks as if trip may have to be cancelled , which is a big burden for more than just myself , but for missing a job im suppose to be at !
negative	i called and left a message 0_weeks_ago about parts for my nissan truck just got a call today i bought the parts from another website and is getting them put on now the answering service said i would receive a call on the next business day
negative	you made no attempt to tell me that you where not actually the reservation desk for the hilton hotel .
negative	by reserving through you i was unable to get my corporate rate and had trouble cancelling my final night_stay when my plans_changed .
negative	by nameing yourself " reservation_counter " you are deliberately misleading the public into thinking you are the official reservations department for the hilton inns etc .
negative	this should be illeagal , and i intend to contact the better bussiness bureau !!
negative	!
negative	i was one of their first customers back in 0000 .
negative	i '_ve used travelocity several dozens of times and i have spent several tens of thousands of dollars on them , but i will never use them again ever .
negative	their customer service has_become deceitful , tricky and rude and nearly_impossible to contact in the first place .
negative	you can buy something pretty quickly but if you need to talk to someone about it consider yourself screwed .
negative	i recently need to talk to customer service about an issue .
negative	each time i called i was put on hold for at_least one hour .
negative	no call - back option was available and you had no_idea how long you would have to wait .
negative	most of the time they would hang_up on you , a busy tone would start beeping , or you would be transferred somewhere_else , wait another hour , just be hung_up on .
negative	it took me nearly 0 hours to speak to someone .
negative	about my issue , last summer i bought a ticket for me and my daughter to fly to copenhagen .
negative	however , my daughter got sick and we had to cancel her ticket .
negative	i still went .
negative	i had bought a travel protection_plan but to get re - imbursement you had to get papers from the doctor fill_out forms etc .
negative	a simpler solution was to use her ticket within one year .
negative	in the cancelation confirmation instructions it says book within one year and that is what we were told .
negative	however , now when i tried to book a second trip we are told that the travel for her has to be completed within one year , which is too soon .
negative	i lost $ 0 , 000 . 00 and after waiting on the phone 0 hours travelocity will not give in an inch in terms of any kind of reimbursement or assistance of any kind .
negative	i really feel i have been cheated and misled and the customer service was straight out of hell not even counting the 0 hours .
negative	this was a shock , but the good news is i won ’ t get abused again .
negative	there are other venues .
negative	avoid this place at all costs !
negative	purchased a duffel bag on july 00st .
negative	when august 0th came and went with no duffel bag , no tracking_info no email response , no return phone_call , i had to open a claim with paypal , miraculously the next_day i got a message that it was mailed ten days after purchase and should show up soon .... total joke !
negative	be_careful of free_samples that they offer since they add up heavily to the shipping cost .
negative	i ordered 0 days ago yet the online status is saying it is still processing and shows no sign of shipment yet .
negative	0 days of processing time is not acceptable in the age of internet .
negative	not to mention their heavy cost of shipping , not just for products but also for samples .
negative	i purchased a vase with the flowers .
negative	they were delivered to my 00 year_old mother wrapped in many dangerous glass pieces as the vase was broken .
negative	she had to call for the help of neighbours to manage the situation and could easily have seriously cut herself .
negative	how they could_possibly have been delivered in this condition i cannot understand .
negative	this is not only poor service but also very dangerous .
negative	didn_'_t work at all .
negative	they told me to keeo it instead of sending it back on a slow boat to china !
negative	my last experience where people were allowed to board without control .
negative	the upstairs was full , the stairs were full the inside was full right up to the driver . we were cramped the commentary describes things on the left which we could not see because of the passengers in the isle . this was the worst ride i had . never again . why aren_'_t the passenger numbers controlled ?
negative	shipped the wrong part , did not respond to a customer service inquiry , website said notification would be given .
negative	i did not receive a email , i was billed quadruple for what i received .
negative	i will never order from partgeek . com again
negative	i recently_purchased 0 prints from fine art america .
negative	i needed them within 00 days to have them framed in time for a grand opening .
negative	the web_site says 0 - 0 days processing time , so they should easily arrive within 00 days .
negative	on the 0th day , after not hearing anything from them , i called and was told the images from the artist were corrupt and they were waiting to hear from the artist .
negative	again , i had to call them to find out this info .
negative	i canceled one of the photos after_contacting the artist directly and he had it printed for much_cheaper .
negative	i was told the others two prints would go out on a monday and asked for overnight shipping .
negative	one tuesday , when i once again hadn_'_t heard from them , i emailed ( yes , emailed ... they don_'_t take calls !)
negative	and was told they were sent a day late and not overnight .
negative	so , now i will not have the prints in time to get them framed for the grand opening .
negative	i would not recommend this company ... i '_m extremely unsatisfied .
negative	i bought a ticket from this company to new_jersey from canada .
negative	on - line it showed the return to be at 0pm on thursday .
negative	after booking the ticket , i found that they had given me a return of 0am on thursday .
negative	i immediately called and asked them to cancel .
negative	i was informed that it had been cancelled at no penalty to me .
negative	i asked if i could re - book via the phone and was told in the most unpleasant way to go on - line .
negative	in my frustration i booked with expedia . com .
negative	this transaction happened since february 00st .
negative	i have been tossed about from customer agent to customer agent in trying to get my money back .
negative	i was sent a confirmation notice but no cancellation_notice .
negative	today is the 00th of march i have been promised that i will get my refund in fifteen day .
negative	i will keep you posted .
negative	checked delivery status on line package was left by back door .
negative	i found package tied to bridge and delivery note stuck to inside of mailbox
negative	bridge is n0 / 0 mile from house
negative	if ups would have said on bridge i could have lived with that .
negative	i will never use ups for shipping again
negative	ups never replied to my email
negative	order three parts .
negative	for one they shipped the wrong part .
negative	the second the did not have even_though their site showed it in stock when i ordered .
negative	they auto canceled just that one part of the order with out giving me the option to cancel the whole thing .
negative	they shipped the wrong part for one of the part they did ship .
negative	they did not refund the full_amount of the canceled part with shipping until i emailed them .
negative	they dont accept returns so i '_m stuck with the wrong part and only one of the things i ordered .
negative	i would never order from them again .
negative	placed my order received a confirmation on the item saying it was shipped out , waited about 0_weeks then called to check on item because i never received a tracking_number then was told that my item was on back order but received a full_refund
negative	i made an order on december_00th , 0000 .
negative	and now it '_s january_00th 0000 !
negative	and i haven_'_t gotten any emails or responses to wear my package is ??
negative	and it said only 0 - 00 days not 00 to 00 days !!
negative	i '_m disappointed
negative	cannot redeem my cards purchased from u
negative	very good people
negative	booked a car in san_francisco , ca while on a trip to south_africa , paid in full but when i went to get car was told that usa and canadian driver license not accepted .
negative	was shown by agent that it was stated on a 0 page general booking conditions , never before did rentalcars made me aware of it , even_though the billing_address for the booking was in canada .
negative	i believe i '_m not the first to experience this kind of tricky business , again should have known as no one charges car_rentals upfront ...
negative	beware , they are not at all helpful once they have your money ....
negative	this site it '_s bad , costumer service it '_s the worst ever .
negative	representative person it '_s not well training .
negative	hard to understand what they say and also confused .
negative	i made a reservation for cabo san lucas on march 00 , and supposedly i booked for all_inclusive according to the representative .
negative	turns_out that when i called to make reservations for activities , i ask for my itinerary to be reviewed and surprise that the representative book me for not all_inclusive .
negative	and i was a whole_ordeal to the point that the told me that the best thing for them to do it was to give me my money back .
negative	what a joke , since i already have airfare pay etc , etc .
negative	than i spoke with some manager and he was able to resolve my problem after 0 hrs of wasting my time .
negative	than kindly gave_me a 00 dlls coupon to use in my next trip and i just try to book a room for vegas and guess what ?
negative	the coupon that he gave_me it '_s not valid !!!
negative	people stay_away from this site .
negative	better use [_external references ].
negative	better reputation .
negative	the customer service is absolutely terrible .
negative	there is no phone_number and they send you stupid emails that are not necessary .
negative	after sending me the wrong part and receiving countless unhelpful emails i '_m ordering the part i need from somewhere_else .
negative	too much of a hassle to deal with this type of service .
negative	i gave car key to the fitter so he could move the car . the service was nice and quick and highly recmmended until on the next_day shopping trip we realised that fitter took £ 0 coin that we always use for shopping troley : 0 !
negative	i hope that he was really hungry and that this one pound will feed him well ;)
negative	i know that it was just one pound but the point is if he took this one pound next time he will steal someones £_00 or satnav or something valuable !
negative	they confirmed the wrong room rate and then sent me 00 emails canceling .
negative	i ended_up using expedia .
negative	i ordered 0 records ( one of , and most_importantly , lyle lovett - san_antonio man ).
negative	after the order was completed , that record was canceled from the order ( for no reason ) by oldies . com and the other 0 less important records were shipped .
negative	this left me paying full shipping_costs for 0 unimportant records .
negative	i would have never ordered in the first place had i known that record was not for sale .
negative	bait and switched and not trusting to order from this site again .
negative	regards ,
negative	robert
negative	i placed the order for some parts listed as in stock .
negative	the next_day i received and email_stating that the parts listed in the email were actually out of stock .
negative	unfortunately , none were actually listed in the email .
negative	i then went online and found out that my entire order had been cancelled .
negative	no reason , just cancelled .
negative	the recourse was to fill_out an investigation ticket .
negative	but the link was broken and the website stated that the ticket system was down .
negative	worst ordering experience .
negative	ever .
negative	i had a terrible experience with this company .
negative	on the day of delivery , the driver refused to carry the boxes up to my new flat ( 0nd floor ), even_though i had payed extra to hunts international for this service .
negative	i carried the boxes myself .
negative	the people that ended_up transporting my items were a removals company from poland , presumably subcontracted by hunts international to cut costs .
negative	on top of things , the communication with the driver was close to impossible .
negative	finally , hunts international did not manage my complain well .
negative	do not use this company to avoid disappointments .
negative	did not know that they require a signature ( because they dont insure anything ) before your stuff can be left at your house .
negative	there was no warning of any kind that i could see about this prior to placing order .
negative	the reason that they do this is so they can say that if anything happens to ur stuff while sitting on ur door_step they dont have to help u out ( isnt this what insurance is for ).
negative	they told me that they wouldnt refund my money due to the ingraving .
negative	well folks as long as u paid with a credit_card and ur purchase was more then $_00 you can call up ur cc com and tell them thr item never showed_up so u just tell them to do a charge back and they take the money back from them and credit ur credit_card and u get ur money back
negative	i ordered an instrument cluster for my pickup .
negative	i was sent a water_pump .
negative	can '_t get through speak with anyone .
negative	was finally sent instructions on how to return the instrument cluster stating they would only
negative	accept an instrument cluster ..
negative	so now i have to convince them i have a water_pump , not only did i have to pay postage for the wrong part , i have to pay return postage on a heavy water_pump that i never wanted in the first place and i '_ll probably be charged a restocking_fee .
negative	the only way i have been able to communicate with this company is by open a new customer_support_ticket each time .
negative	be sure to read
negative	the return_policy under customer service .
negative	you will find that no matter_how inept their service is --- you are responisble
negative	the girls rip you off and if you email them complaining_about it .
negative	they consider it harassment and the site will ban you
negative	lights have glass cover that falls non stop will not stay up attached to magnets .
negative	i bought 0 of these lights and they all give me problems .
negative	no as good as older models i also have .
negative	i think this was a good deal on supplements , but it takes_forever to package and ready the shipment .
negative	dps or any competitor would already have it well on its way , and dps always charges 0 . 00 for all shipping , and they are cheap ?
negative	very expensive !!!!!!!
negative	!
negative	comprei no dia 00 / 00 / 0000 , ate mês passado conseguia rastrear e agora sumiu o registro de rastreio através do site da dhl , assim como sumiu o registro no site da heltdesigns .
negative	quero meu dinheiro de volta ou vou para justiça , isso é sacanagem cobrar por um produto e não entregar eu reembolsar .
negative	meu pedido foi realizado sobre o n ° 000000000 .
negative	i '_ll never use their services !
negative	ever ...
negative	booked two_nights got a price for two_nights and info with confirmation number and a name of who i talked to .
negative	a week_later i checked email and noticed was booked only for one night and it couldnt be fixed .
negative	if i made new reservation i would lose the one night that i was already charged for !
negative	ridiculous .
negative	never again will i book through these_guys again .
negative	it has_been nearly 0 months and still no resolution on a problem of the wrong parts being sent out .
negative	they do not seem to read their own notes and ask the same questions over and over yet do nothing to correct the problem !
negative	part was damaged which i understand can happen , but taking to long to resolve .
negative	responses from support have taken to long ... 0 or 0 days is not good customer service .
negative	there was a problem booking a trip .
negative	every time i got to the payment screen , the system could not complete the transaction .
negative	as directed , i started a new search at_least five times , and i kept getting the same error messages .
negative	each time , i had to re - enter all of my cc_info and the info for all of my fellow_travelers , so this was a very time_consuming process .
negative	i finally called customer service .
negative	after a long period on hold , i reached a rude and condescending operator , who told me that the entire first page of search_results was sold out , but he could book me on a different flight at almost twice the price .
negative	i refreshed the search with him on the phone , and the website still showed four seats available on my preferred flight .
negative	after making excuses for the bait and switch , and never apologizing , he ushered me off the phone and hung_up .
negative	i ordered a part that they were unable to ship .
negative	they sent an_email_saying that they were refunding my money .
negative	it has_been 00 days today and i still do not have my refund .
negative	they are playing the blame game and saying that the issue is with my card company .
negative	i know that is not true .
negative	never buy anything from them !
negative	on 00 / 00 / 0000 had lunch buffet , food was ask if everything was alright , i replied just ok .
negative	the response was what do you mean " just ok ".
negative	the staff was rude .
negative	i was charged_twice on my debit_card and when i looked at my bank_statement i noticed it .
negative	i went back to pizza hut and they were rude about the incident , told me there was noway their register would not allow it to happen , i had the bank_statement with me and showed them .
negative	the team - leader was the only one there no manager , said she would give it to their manager and see if there was something they could do about it .
negative	i replied they better do something , she then told me to leave or she would call the police .
negative	i contacted the corp . office and they replied they were sorry about the rudeness , and someone would contact me in 0 days or so .
negative	never mentioning the double charge on my card .
negative	today is the 00th and still not heard from anyone .
negative	to me this is card fraud .
negative	i have been going here for 00 years .
negative	they just don_'_t seem to care about customer service .
negative	what a shame .
negative	my next step is to contact the authorities and my bank file charges for unauthorized card use .
negative	we first purchased a plot in 0000 for my youngest brother , later for my other brother in 0000 .
negative	later in 0000 for my father , last 0000 for my mother .
negative	when i traveled to the cemetery to see the graves , and order the markers .
negative	( they could not find either my mother nor my fathers plots ).
negative	when i went to the office to check they had a real hard time finding them .
negative	it took around 00_minutes .
negative	when they said they found them , the plots seemed different than what i remembered from the funeral .
negative	my fathers funeral was under a tree near the veterans area , which he is a vet .
negative	my mothers was many yards down , i remember because my friend that was with me commented on the distance .
negative	when they did find them they were side by side .
negative	i called recently to check on my brothers plot it was covered with mud and mulch , and fathers veteran '_s marker and again they could not locate my father '_s name .
negative	i was just there a month_ago , i have two different business cards from two of the employee '_s i spoke with that day , and handed them the paperwork for the vet '_s .
negative	marker .
negative	now they can '_t find a record of him again .
negative	they sure remember the thousands of dollars it takes to put them there .
negative	everything for my parents was prepaid , markers , plots , vaults , and all .
negative	there should be no_problems locating them or their plots .
negative	unless you don_'_t have them ?
negative	it is a disgrace anyone should have to go through this .
negative	i conveyed my disapproval at their way of business and the misplacement of bodies .
negative	now i am wondering_if my parent '_s are really there at all .
negative	it is so strange that they have lost or misplaced their records twice in less_than 0 months .
negative	i would avoid catawba memorial park , funerals and cremations .
negative	a week or so ago i was in our local lowe '_s in lenoir , nc .
negative	i purchased some items for plumbing , several of the same in size and price .
negative	there were no sku '_s , the cashier replied gruffly " you have to go get me a sku ".
negative	i am sorry but i do not get paid to do anyone '_s job .
negative	i replied call the department and get it .
negative	she did but described the wrong item , ask for pvc , it was cpvc , which i showed her .
negative	her attitude became more inflamed .
negative	i informed her there were no more i wanted them all .
negative	i walked back to the department got the empty_box brought it to her and she still complained .
negative	the man in the plumbing dept .
negative	came up and told her that it was cpvc , not pvc .
negative	they have different prices .
negative	( just as i told her ).
negative	finally i had to request a manager .
negative	it was all totally uncalled for .
negative	to top it all off she denied it all .
negative	luckily i had someone with me .
negative	so it has come to customers doing everything , purchasing , price checking as well as paying , if that '_s the case you no_longer need employee '_s .
negative	pricy
negative	i placed an order on 00 january and selected the dhl global mail option of the three options available , which promised 0 - 00 days .
negative	nowhere on the healthdesigns . com or dhl ’_s websites was there any reference that the parcel might be transferred to a local post_office .
negative	i was under the impression that this is a slow dhl delivery option , not merely a method which gets the item into the normal post_office mail service .
negative	surprise : it apparently is the same as a post_office service ; your parcel is thrown_into a dhl bag and then disappears into the normal post_office mail .
negative	after four months i have not yet received my parcel .
negative	in comparison i '_ve ordered numerous books from amazon . com in the us via normal post_office mail and delivery , quoted as take 0 - 0_weeks .
negative	any complaint about non_- arrival to amazon has always been met with an offer to refund or send a replacement .
negative	i believe a replacement or refund would be appropriate by now from healthdesigns . com
negative	i just had a shirt made and it arrived 0 cm larger that my indicated measurements .
negative	i don_'_t know why i even ordered it because the pants they made for me 0 months_ago were also way to large and i had to spend hours emailing with them to have the alterations reimbursed .
negative	it '_s an awful service , i wish i hadn_'_t fallen for their nice and inviting website .
negative	don_'_t make the same mistake , you will regret it .
negative	they don_'_t seem to get it right in the first place and their customer service is completely unreasonable .
negative	unable to speak or chat with live_person is pathetic .
negative	if you have a problem good luck you email some " support email " and they respond to you in 00 - 00_hours with 0 - way rude email that you may not furthur inquiry .
negative	delivery was a week late owing to the " anti_fraud code " not arriving in the post at all .
negative	when delivery finaly made it was incomplete .
negative	i '_m nearly two_weeks_later from order dates still_waiting
negative	i tried to contact customer several_times before i placed my order to ensure i was ordering the correct part .
negative	i wasted about an_hour on hold so i decided to just place my order and hope for the best .
negative	when the part arrived it was incorrect .
negative	it was supposed to fit my awd but it was for a fwd .
negative	again i tried to call them but no one picked_up .
negative	i filled_out the online form for a return , explained the problem and mentioned that i would like to speak to someone in the hopes of getting the correct part .
negative	all i got was an ra # for the return which cost me $_00 in shipping .
negative	this experience was a huge waste of time and money .
negative	i ordered an item £_00 pounds because monster_supplements were the cheapest so i paid the extra for next_day delivery this was monday_night so i didn_'_t expect the item till wednesday , like most people i work so i missed the first delivery this is when things started going wrong , on the card left at my house it said call or use the internet to for re - delivery first i called 0 times no answers ok then i '_ll use the internet just to be told the item will not be re - delivered .
negative	so the next_day i called again all at different times still no answer that '_s 0 more times but the item was re - delivered and yet another card , tried to call again 00 times on friday in the end i gave up , on the saturday i made the 00 miles round_trip to pick_up the parcel from the depot which they couldn_'_t find for 00_minutes .
negative	so the money i might have saved using monster_supplements was lost in the cost of phone_calls and petrol , i should have just paid £_00 at tesco '_s and had it that day thanks ukmail
negative	bought an itunes_card .
negative	code says the card was never activated .
negative	when i contacted itunes support which is the only support this company sent me to , itunes claims the card was never purchased from any channel ... this company is scam ... avoid like the plague
negative	i booked a holiday to portugal for me and my partner in september_0000 .
negative	i was unfortunate enough to break my leg whilst surfing on one of the days .
negative	i was eventually treated in the private hospital in alvore in the alvarge .
negative	getting through to the insurance company was a nightmare .
negative	from memory , there was a uk phone_number which was transferred to a spanish call_centre .
negative	when i could contact someone with a command of the english_language , it was agreed that my treatment would be covered .
negative	i was then contacted after my operation and informed that i would not be covered , as surfing was considered a hazardous activity , not covered by my policy .
negative	this was untrue .
negative	only holidays where there are more than 00 days surfing require a premium .
negative	as my entire holiday was for one week only , clearly i was covered .
negative	there were more phone_calls , many in pidgin english with call_centre staff from god_knows where before this was resolved .
negative	this is either down to poor training of the staff or the staff have been told to refuse claims to all but the most persistent of claimants .
negative	as my accident occurred towards the end of my holiday , it was necessary for my partner to find alternative accommodation near the hospital , because of the extended stay .
negative	i never saw the apartment , but my partner complained bitterly on a daily_basis about the quality of the hotel .
negative	her room was positioned on the ground_floor next to the swimming_pool and next to the public bars and she was unable to sleep .
negative	the insurance company were unwilling to find a more suitable_alternative but eventually relented when some drunken idiot mistook her room ( which she was unable to lock ) for the entrance to the toilet .
negative	the hospital was great as were the aer lingus staff , who were very accommodating on my flight home .
negative	however , neither of these two parties had anything to do with your company .
negative	in dealing_with your call_centre staff , i was always treated with suspicion , as though i was someone_who was trying to scam the company .
negative	maybe this is a reflection of the staff '_s perceived honesty of other claimants , but it is wrong that this should be the default method of dealing_with all claimants .
negative	this should be addressed with proper training .
negative	for example , if someone turns up in hospital in a wetsuit with a broken tibia and fibula and tells you he sustained the injury whilst surfing , there '_s a good chance he is telling the truth and that he should be dealt_with compassionately and in good faith .
negative	tried to get a texbook for my upcoming class .
negative	i was sent the instructors version ( which bookbyte only pays back 0 . 00 ) returned the book for a refund .
negative	bookbyte has had it for over a week ( fedex tracking ) still no refund .
negative	i will never use this site again
negative	ordering and payment staight forward but after that it went_downhill .
negative	ordered item on tues 0pm paid for next_day delivery phoned on friday to chase item up , was told the order was complete but for some unexplained reason hadn_'_t been sent out .
negative	i was promised item would be delivered following_day saturday .
negative	the courier delivered a parcel but unfortunately for me the wrongly addressed parcel . left a phone message at deep_blue which appears to have fallen on deaf_ears no phone contact or apology .
negative	courier could only be contacted by email i sent a message and recieved a reply that item wasn_'_t left as there was nobody at the address to sign for it ??
negative	?
negative	item finally delivered on monday .
negative	why pay for next_day delivery when you get crap service like this .
negative	hi all ,
negative	my experience with firefly was a desaster .
negative	the rental place has cost me 000 . 00 € for four days .
negative	0 ) the car was not conform , little car for 0 persons , i receive a c0 for four persons
negative	0 ) i was mandatory to take the the cdw without excess , the reason was that my credit_card was not ok for the guarantee ( 0000 €), my credit_card is ok for 0000 €
negative	it cost me 00 € per days ( other rentalcar are 0 or 0 €/ days )
negative	0 ) normally for four days , you receive the full_tank and return full , here it cost me 00 € because they wanted to restitute the tank empty .
negative	i have only made 000_km .
negative	0 ) i paid 0 . 00 € standard credit_card fee
negative	0 ) i paid 0 . 00 € +_tax for washing supplies
negative	0 ) i had paid for outside hours , they asked me 00 € if i return the car at 0 : 00 .
negative	i was not agreed i decided to return it at 0am , my fly was at 0 am .
negative	for information , i had reserved a car with autojardim in november for 00 days , the costs was 000 €,
negative	kind_regards .
negative	i bought some playstation_network_cards from this website , when i received the codes one of them had already been used .
negative	i don_'_t know what kind of shifty company you have to be , to be buying dodgy cards from the russian darknet for this error to occur .
negative	when i politely tried to use their janky support system for help , they essentially accused me of using the card and then lying about it to get free credit .
negative	i '_m so darn sorry i tried to give help to your suspicious fledgling business .
negative	i won_'_t make that mistake again , you unbelievable crooks .
negative	get lost .
negative	i wouldn_'_t normally use this kind of language but i '_ve never had such shoddy treatment to immediately be assumed to be a thief .
negative	that '_s a really nice way to treat a customer who '_s spent hundreds of dollars on your website .
negative	wrangler jeans appeared to be seconds .
negative	each pair was a different size ( i measured ).
negative	i was told they had to be returned ups which cost me $_00 . 00 for ground .
negative	usps would have cost $ 0 . 00 .
negative	the initial shipping was $_00 . 00 plus the return shipping of $_00 . 00 which totals $_00 . 00 .
negative	that is $_00 . 00 deducted from my purchase of $_00 . 00 which gives me a net refund of $_00 . 00 .
negative	i will not do_business with big_tall_direct again .
negative	i feel i was ripped_off !
negative	additionally , read big_tall_direct '_s response to my review below .
negative	not once do they mention any form of concern or an_apology for my bad_experience with the products i purchased from them .
negative	they then mention wrangler provides a 0 year_warranty on their product .
negative	seriously , are you suggesting i go to the trouble of contacting wrangler regarding a product i just received from your company , wow !
negative	that is not how a company provides great customer service .
negative	i am a big box home improvement store manager .
negative	my advice to big_tall_direct is consider some training in customer complaint resolution .
negative	i ordered a left_side clear parking light for my sons 00 ford_ranger .
negative	upon_opening the box i realized that i was mistakenly sent a right side amber parking light .
negative	i contacted parts_geek via_e_-_mail only to be told that they would not pay return shipping due to my error ???
negative	i told them that the box was indeed marked correctly and that they should look the part # up on their website and see what was mistakenly placed in the box .
negative	they recieved the part a week and a half ago yet have asked me twice for tracking_# which i have provided both_times .
negative	guess what still no refund a week and a half later .
negative	also did i mention that their phone # disconects you after 00_minutes even if you are trying to place an order .
negative	and the customer service ( theres an oxymoron ) form takes 0 days at best to get a response from .. never again geek boy !
negative	their price match plus 0 %_discount is a scam .
negative	i used it with quotes from a competitor .
negative	after accepting my order they sent an_email_stating that they didn_'_t consider the named company to be a legitimate competitor and raised my $_00 total to $_00 .
negative	i cancelled my order and won_'_t order anything ever again !
negative	i recently was referred by priceline booking system to what to its own criteria , different from other booking sites , was a 0_star_hotel .
negative	definetely this hotel was below a comparable 0_star category in the same vicinity .
negative	actually in the same trip i had the opportunity to be allocated to a real 0_star_hotel and by no means both experiences were close to be similar .
negative	i pointed this out to their customer service department andf they only did care so much to acknowledge that their proprietary system maight be flawed sometimes and they should correct it dinamically .
negative	next time i '_ll think_twice when using their anonymous bidding system .
negative	the risk of being cheap tricked and misallocated in a lower class hotel may not be worth it .
negative	paid for a unlock service 0 months_ago and they haven_'_t done anything .
negative	upon request for a refund they have not gotten in touch with me for a month .
negative	i would avoid these con - artists at all costs .
negative	they will just steal your money .
negative	this company does not answer there phone nor respond to emails till next_day .
negative	i made a mistake on my order and there was no way to cancel and correct .
negative	never again will i buy from this company and i will be sure to tell others about my experience .
negative	by the way i order $ 0 , 000 . 00 average a month in auto_parts online .
negative	expedia misleads between booking and confirmed booking ; showed_up at hotel and it didn_'_t have my reservation despite that expedia booked me ( i was stranded ); i called expedia and was placed on hold for over an_hour , hung_up on a couple of times , supervisors were as bad , reading from a script and being totally unresponsive or helpful .
negative	it sounded_like a zoo in the background .
negative	expedia also misleads on flights when it purportedly assigns you seats ; it does not .
negative	i assigned my seat and months later when i was checking in my ticket was without a seat assignment and i wound_up getting the worst seat on the plane in an international flight .
negative	check in was horrible as i couldn_'_t do it on the expedia sight and had to go to the airline site directly for help to just check in , which wasn_'_t easy as my ticket was done through expedia .
negative	overall , its customer service is horrific ; untruthful and rude ; they keep you on hold_forever , checking in occasionally to see if you hung_up ; expedia is a chop - shop operation .
negative	ordered part , received confirmation that the order was received .
negative	no follow_up dor days on shipping information , delay reason or ant type .
negative	your service is pathetic
negative	when i arrived at the hotel i dropped my bags with the driver curb side and went in to check in with the hotel .
negative	it took 0 minutes and he left without me .
negative	then when he returned 00_minutes late he dropped me at the wrong end if the terminal because he didn_'_t want to go to the proper door .
negative	so i had to walk almost a block outside .
negative	this company is a rip - off !
negative	i paid_extra for expidited shipping and they failed to ship on time .
negative	then they provided an invalid tracking_number .
negative	now to correct the issue they want more shipping money !
negative	don_'_t buy from these theives !

negative	i purchase 0 tickets for the beyonce concert on may 0 ( ie tomorrow ) on 0 march_0000 for hundreds of pounds .
negative	.
negative	i have yet to receive the tickets despite numerous phone_calls .
negative	i am interested to hear from others who have had similar problems to understand how wide spread the problem is and to determine what can be done .
negative	plse contact me via facebook .
negative	i was checking pricing on line and booked , i thought , directly through hampton_inn .
negative	the next date i got a pop_up ad direct from hampton_inn that was $_00 less .
negative	when i called to try to re - book i then found out that i didn_'_t book direct .
negative	it took several questions before the customer service person admitted that they were not the hampton_inn and i could not cancel .
negative	this review is being provided because reservation_counter sent an e_-_mail asking me to evaluate their services .
negative	if i can not give them a 0 or 0 they said to call to discuss with them .
negative	i called and have been on hold for 00_minutes to tell them i find them deceptive .
negative	i decided to give them a chance to explain themselves before i hit send ...... i think 00_minutes is enough .
negative	ordered 0 items which arrived after 0 days but 0 bottle was broken in transit ( the cheapest item ).
negative	emailed customer service and sent a picture of the package with broken bottle but had no response .
negative	emailed again 0 week after sent a further email but still no response so_far .
negative	it was only a monin bottle but not easy to get elsewhere .
negative	apart_from this i would have given 0_stars but lack of contact is totally_unacceptable
negative	wrong product shipped and still have not received what i ordered .
negative	customer service was nice but i am still_waiting on my order now going on 0_weeks with no communication from the company
negative	i bought a watch_dogs cd_key from cjs_cd_keys and the product was not as_advertised . it was meant to come with the day 0 dlc , but did not .
negative	i ordered at a time when the special_edition was not listed on the site , and the product page made it clear in red text that it should come with the dlc .
negative	i did activate before the release_date and therefore should have been eligible for the dlc .
negative	support have been unwilling to acknowledge this problem and assume that i am talking_about being unable to activate the game , despite making it clear the game activated fine .
negative	this is unacceptable and i shall not buy from them in future if this is not resolved .
negative	my order was put in on dec 00
negative	har_lige læst på tv0 ´_s hjemmeside at jeg åbenbart ikke_er_den_eneste der_har_haft problemer_med forkert dato hos flybillet . dk .

negative	alt i alt samme historie som flere andre åbenbart har hvor_man_ikke_kan bevise at de_har lavet fejlen og man ingen hjælp får .
negative	lad være med at handle der , der findes mange_andre bedre alternativer !
negative	i shopped regularly many_times and suddenly i started having problems ..
negative	your customer service system is very complicated i never received help only mails saying a chat was opened .
negative	now i shop my us <_external link_removed_> and is very fast and trustable !
negative	you lose me as client because you don_'_t care answer and help me )))) you sell immediate need products , do something with your response system ... javier lopez
negative	i ordered a water_pump on partsgeek . com in november , when i still had not received it in january i emailed them with my part # supplied by them .
negative	their reponse was i had received it and to check with my neighbors and side doors .
negative	i live in an apartment complex and in dallas , tx where my 0 square miles averages over 000 robberies a year .
negative	i doubt my neighbors are going to turn down a free water_pump and just lie to me .
negative	we never talk to begin with .
negative	i put my ink in my printer , and the black_ink came out blue . i bought a lot of ink , and its usless
negative	i booked two flights online and got only one confirmed and had to call and told there was a 00 - 0 / 0 wait time and after numerous more calls could not get any one to be of help and could not get a supervisor and finally needed to book directly though the airline .
negative	never got any feedback after an online email to customer service nor do i expect any feedback from this but feel better to vent .
negative	i am now considering emailing all family friend and businesses connections about my experience and let them decide on whether to use travelocity .
negative	they screwed_up my order , sent me the wrong items ... called customer service 0 times daily and never got a phone_call back !
negative	the only contact i have gotten has_been via_email and im still_waiting for them to tell me where to send this stuff back , needless to say i want my money back !!
negative	they charged my credit_card immediatly when i originally made the order ... not only is it the wrong stuff it took about 0_weeks to get it !!
negative	and its lookin like its gonna be even longer before i get refunded !!
negative	very bad business !

negative	we contracted with totally driven for transport from our london hotel in kensington to harwich in order to board our cruise ship .
negative	the trip was horrible .
negative	0 .
negative	the driver was late – evidently he was parked up the street from the hotel and the hotel ’_s concierge noticed him sitting in his unmarked cab .
negative	0 .
negative	during our trip through london and on the a00 , he was constantly on his mobile_phone ( it is illegal to be on a hand ’_s free phone while_driving in england )
negative	0 .
negative	he put both my wife and me in danger by suddenly pulling off to the shoulder of the a00 highway , backing up for at_least 000 yards and then taking the ramp to some side road .
negative	he said that he missed the turn .
negative	0 .
negative	once off the a00 he was completely lost and we had to insist that he pull over for directions .
negative	this happened three_times .
negative	0 .
negative	the only gps he had was on his cell_phone ( which frequently had no signal ) and because he had to look up directions on it made for an even more dangerous ride .
negative	during our cruise , we responded to a totally driven questionnaire regarding our experience with their service .
negative	in a series of emails we advised them of the above experience and indicated that we felt totally driven was responsible , and we should receive some sort of compensation .
negative	their response was :
negative	drivers and vehicles are licensed by transport for london ’_s public carriage office .
negative	it is on the basis of these licenses that they are recruited .
negative	they are self_employed and work according to the rules and procedures that we detail , sometimes however they fail to follow those guidelines .
negative	an investigation into this order has_been initiated , and the driver has_been summoned to the office to explain his actions .
negative	in a sub subsequent email they offered us a £_00 . 00 credit for future rides with their company ( as if we would ever take a chance with them again !)
negative	we believe that totally driven is responsible for the actions of their drivers and warn fellow_travelers not to deal with this irresponsible and uncaring company .
negative	sent me the wrong_size part .
negative	.
negative	.
negative	won_'_t fit .
negative	.
negative	.
negative	waste of time and money .
negative	i ordered 0ctw earrings .
negative	they arrived loose in the setting .
negative	i got a return_authorization and shipped back immediately .
negative	they call having received them and say they would correct the problem but i had already purchased another set elsewhere and the said i ' d get a credit .
negative	the next_day i received another call from joseph attempting to sway my decision again i said i had already replaced them ; he said he would give me a credit in about a week .
negative	two_weeks_later still no credit ; i emailed them , then again on the third and fourth weeks .
negative	had to contact me bank card to get action and provide proof of delivery .
negative	total time took two months to get a credit .
negative	told me they didn_'_t have the right part anyway , then i had to pay to have the part boxed and shipping back to them .
negative	never never ever buy from them again or refer them to anyone .

negative	parts_geek had a good price and shipped promptly , but left me short of 0 nuts -- these were shown in the pictured item , but not found anywhere in the shipping materials .
negative	i installed all of the items , coming to the spot where the two nutless bolts were to be installed , and discovered this .
negative	0 hours of work , cutting off old rusted suspension parts and installing the parts that did arrive brought me to the point where the two nuts were to be installed .
negative	i informed parts_geek of this , asked either for an adjustment of the price so that i could go out and purchase new nuts , or that they could ship these small items to me to complete the order .
negative	their solution was for me to take off the parts , 00_% of which were installed -- remove them from the car , make it undrivable for several days while i shipped the parts back .
negative	parts_geek would then have parts returned that had already been installed -- in michigan , in the winter , with salt , mud , snow , ice dripping from the car as i installed them -- parts_geek wanted these parts back -- then they would hopefully send me more parts that i could also install .
negative	the 0 hour job would be 0 hours ( taking off the parts ), my car would be unusable , and i would have 0 more hours to wrestle the parts into place .
negative	parts_geek would have unsaleable parts left in their inventory ---
negative	or they could send me 0 nuts to complete the job .
negative	as it was , i was able to use the old nuts , pre_- stressed to the load when last put on in 0000 .
negative	all i wanted was all the parts , and parts_geek considered nothing for my time and trouble ..." take them off and send them to us , and we '_ll send some more back !"
negative	they already had proven that they can '_t pack an order -- what confidence would i have that they would pack the second order properly .
negative	additonally -- when cheap plastic package arrived ( 00 pounds in what amounted to a bunch of bubble_wrap -- one end was open -- open enough to lost two small nuts .
negative	i simply wanted two nuts , am i too nuts ?
negative	i would accept an adjustment in the price , but i won_'_t accept the answer that i have to remove what is already connected to the car , kill a week while they pass in the mail , then go through the labor all over again .
negative	that part is two nuts -- i mean that part is too nuts !

negative	my order had an estimated ship date of 0 / 00 .
negative	i sent an_email on 0 / 00 to see what the status is and i have not heard back from anyone .
negative	so_far the customer service is severely lacking and the chances of me ordering from again are very slim .
negative	bad qa and wrong parts two orders in a row , i will never order from you again .
negative	i have ordered from your site twice .
negative	i have gotten wrong parts both_times .
negative	the first time i didn_'_t examine the part immediately as the project was a month out , then when i went to install the part it was the wrong part , i ordered a power_window_regulator and you sent me a manual regulator and i couldn_'_t return it due to your " 00 day return no exception rule ".
negative	so , i guess i will go to a0auto . com next time .
negative	then i reordered the regulator and you sent me the wrong part again , get your shit together !
negative	the seller sent me not what i requested .
negative	instead of a left mirror i received a right one .
negative	now i have a big head ache .
negative	the customer_support is extremely slow .
negative	i wait for 0 - 0 days to receive reply to my email .
negative	i already spent a whole week and did not receive even a rma yet .
negative	i would recommend to avoid this seller .
negative	this is certainly a case of clever photography and product description because the difference_between what was expected and what was delivered could not have been wider .
negative	for nearly_£_00 the arrangement looked really good and a sizeable one but the actual product was a small table decoration and incredibly poor value for money .
negative	i have shown it to a professional florist friend and she said that it was dreadful value knowing what the items actually cost and what she would have provided .
negative	the order process and delivery were excellent but the product was hopeless and i will not be using them again .
negative	horrible experience ... seller took money ... never sent product .
negative	sent numerous_emails to seller and not one reply .
negative	contacted wepay and told to give seller two_weeks to get product despite no contact wharsoever from seller after a week .
negative	i am sure i will never see this money again but plan to file dispute with credit_card .
negative	i own a gym and this is the second time i have paid £ 0 . 00 for express delivery .
negative	it took 0 days to arrive !
negative	after reporting problem i got a voucher refund .
negative	i let a lot of my gym users use the gym as a postal address for your products !
negative	no more !
negative	other clients of mine have had the same thing happen to them .
negative	we are now going to try another company .
negative	your after sales_dept is a joke !
negative	i bought , what i still believe to be , a chainsaw from this company .
negative	after a few hours of cutting , the chain lost its cut and so i went onto the company '_s site to order a replacement chain , ensuring i ordered the correct size .
negative	i have so_far received 0 incorrectly picked chains and had to endure far too much time of waiting on queuing systems and explaining the issues over and over again .
negative	the products seem okay , but the service is definitely sub - standard !
negative	i have now reduced this from 0 to 0 as i cannot_believe their complete inability to provide the correct part can be anything but malicious , as no company can be this stupid !
negative	three chains sent and every one of them has_been wrong .
negative	it '_s supposed to be a new chain for one of their own chainsaws , ordered from them , so how hard should this be !!!
negative	!
negative	i purchased 0 tubs of mega cissus which i received in very poor condition .
negative	0 tubs lid was half off and the other tubs label was torn and worn out .
negative	i complained to customer_services to be told i had to send them back before they would dispatch a new ones without so much as an_apology .
negative	i am still_waiting for a new batch to be sent out .
negative	thought i would try a new company , will not buy from them again .
negative	doesn_'_t deserve a star
negative	ther are scams everywhere !
negative	i know this .
negative	what bothers_me is that living_social does nothing to help protect its customers from companies that are running scams .
negative	they always hide behind their policies which apprently do not protect you as member .
negative	they only serve to protect the scam merchant .
negative	don_'_t trust living_social .
negative	i have never had a problem with groupon .
negative	living_social on the other hand , has no standards to which they hold their merchants to and they refuse to help you resolve_issues with merchants .
negative	i ordered from opticsfast and after a week they still had not shipped my order .
negative	i did online_chat twice , and the second chat was rude and unhelpful .
negative	i called and tried to see if they could help expedite their process , but the lady would not help me .
negative	i requested that she cancel the order , and she told me that she , a " customer service " rep , could not do it .
negative	i had to email sales .
negative	so , i emailed sales , and they told me to confirm that i had read their cancellation_policy and were going to charge me 00_% of the cost of the glasses .
negative	i '_m glad i used my amex and could rely_on them to not let opticsfast steal from me .
negative	placed a routine order of one dvd ... took over two_weeks to ship it and over three_weeks to receive it .
negative	pricing was no better_than the competition .
negative	was foolish enough to try it again ... this time it took over two months , and still not shipped !!!
negative	when i called to cancel , they offered no reason .
negative	i logged_into my account and removed all card info .
negative	next_day , they sent me an_email ( from dennis pettet ) saying " hey ben we just got the dvd , shipping it now ".
negative	i emailed back , called again to cancel , only to learn they have re - entered my card information !
negative	never dealt_with any online entity like this before , i have no_idea how any positive_reviews could come from this site ( shills ?
negative	).
negative	they have low_prices .
negative	but if you want to talk to some one you can '_t .
negative	i have tried to ask a question and they wont answer me back they just sent me the same email as the one befor .
negative	i bought a radiator for my truck and they sent me the wrong one and now i have to pay to ship it back to them .
negative	you can not get any help from them .
negative	i have tried to call them and you just have to get a ticket and they will email you back .
negative	i would rather talk to some one and not wait 00 to 00 to hear back from them and not even get the answer you were looking for .
negative	i would tell people to not use this site ever they are no help
negative	booked a hotel that was advertised one price then got billed double the amout .
negative	called customer service very rude and told me it was market price .. classic bait and switch .
negative	.. way to go will never book anything again and advise others not to .. you missed out on a good customer .
negative	. your loss
negative	customer service is bad and i never was able to order my book .
negative	they flagged my account for reasons unknown and were not very helpful in solving the issue .
negative	i had to order from somewhere_else and it caused my assignment to be late .
negative	how are tripadvisor to decide what going to survive or not ?
negative	it is already hard enough to run a business , i dont thing you need to give the opportunity to someone to ruin the hard - work of someone_else .
negative	tripadvisor should be ban , do not use it
negative	give me the price of a ticket up - front and complete .
negative	be honest for once .
negative	product was in poor condiiton - even shop mamager admitted they would not accept in that condition as a return from a customer - gave feedback to headoffice - no response at all
negative	reserved and prepaid a car for 0 days in bamberg , germany .
negative	wasn_'_t able to pick it up the first day , and the phone_number on the e_- receipt was answered by a hair salon .
negative	arrived first thing on day 0 , expected the car to be available .
negative	it had been rented to another and nothing was available .
negative	the customer service rep offered no solution .
negative	there was no attempt to call or email us to inquire whether we still wanted the car , even_though we had prepaid for the car .
negative	this was a very frustrating experience .
negative	we rented through autoeurope because of its affiliation with avis , but will not patronize this company again .
negative	i had the worst experience with priceline last_week .
negative	i had a job to do in new_york , so i was debating between getting car service , or getting a car_rental .
negative	finally we found a 000 dollar rental for 0 days through priceline .
negative	my plane was late , then they put me on a different flight , finally at 00 . 00 in the morning i am at budget rental and they are trying to charge me 000_dollars instead of 000 .
negative	i spent an_hour on the phone with priceline , they try to give me bogus excuses , of why that could of happen , they didn_'_t do anything to accommodate me , finally at 0 : 00 in the morning they said " have a good night !"
negative	i will never use them again !
negative	and if you don_'_t want a chance to end up stranded in a not so familiar location in the middle of the night without a car , or a hotel , don_'_t use their flaky services neither !
negative	really 0 days late , when it was suppose to be on the 00 feb 0000 , or at_least 00 , but 0 days_later , along with no contact phone_number
negative	wow
negative	i have used ebookers previously and been very satisfied with their services .
negative	therefore , i was surprised to learn that i had been charged in euros rather_than us dollars as this caused the cost to exceed what i had expected based on the information you sent me before i purchased the tickets .
negative	i based the cost on the pounds to dollars conversion rate .
negative	now the cost , even with the discount , is greater than if i had purchased it directly with the hotel or any us provider .
negative	unless this is rectified , i shall not use ebookers again .
negative	sincerely ,

negative	i used paypal to pay for my order , put in me delivery address as the place i currently live , shopto took it upon themselves to send it to where i used to live !
negative	told me to go and ask the people who moved in if i could have it !
negative	the cheek !
negative	so now because of their mistake i have to wait 00 days to even begin the process of claiming my money back , jokers !
negative	was told the part was on hold and 0 days_later found out the order was cancelled .
negative	i should have been told the order was cancelled from the start so that i could make other arrangements .
negative	there is no number to call and email_notification takes days to receive .
negative	too bad , they have good prices and a nice layout to their website , just not worth the trouble when you really need parts .
negative	in middle of dealing_with a dispute between your company and park n fly .
negative	not real happy being stuck in the middle while 0 companies point fingers at each other .
negative	i have called your billing department 0 times with no results .
negative	i have called local park n fly office with no results .
negative	working with their corporate_office now to see what happens .
negative	this has left a very bad_taste in my mouth after dealing_with this since sunday .
negative	the service form vip was ok , but i was shocked to see a 00 euro surcharge for snow tyres on the invoice from <_external link_removed_> at geneva_airport .
negative	since they informed us that all their cars were fitted with snow tyres , we would have had to ask to have them removed to avoid this charge , which was not mentioned in the original_quote .
negative	they are presumably relying on the fact that it is difficult to dispute a bill that you have already paid in another country / currency and are exploiting this to cheat their customers .
negative	about my worst online purchasing experience .
negative	in spite of excellent initial fulfillment and helpful customer service people , the shipping / returns_department seemed not to care or perhaps was very incompetent .
negative	after returning a wrong_size with their rma , usps said it was delivered but it was several weeks and many calls before they finally admitted having the return parts .
negative	then , in spite of my checking the " store credit " box on their form , the refunded the cost to my paypal_account , causing further delays for posting .
negative	they said on a tuesday they had the correct part and would get it to me by friday , but they didn_'_t ship until thursday , and then by ground .
negative	too bad for the rest of th eteam there , i will never buy from them again .
negative	i looked up mt vernon il , your site booked me at vernon bc , nonrefundable .
negative	i had to pay twice .
negative	there no customer service so there no way inquire_about a product . when you order you get the wrong stuff , when you return it you lose money the reason_why people buy from you is because they are looking for a good deal . you need to speak to someone in customer service and if you can '_t you are going to get negative_reviews
negative	thanks !
negative	my broken laptop allowed_me to interact with your horribly trained and non_- caring representatives for six miserable weeks .
negative	your guarantee says my laptop would be repaired in two_weeks , but your representatives said , " naw ," that '_s not really true .
negative	you enabled_me to take numerous , non_- refreshing breaks from work , by keeping me on hold for hours at a time .
negative	you gave_me the pleasure of practicing zen , deep - cleaning breaths , when your representatives refused to let_me speak to a manager .
negative	you gave_me intimate knowledge on when fedex delivers , by screwing up the first repair and having me return my laptop , and then screwing up the second repair by having me return my laptop again .
negative	you allowed_me the pleasure of finding exactly_what replacement laptop i wanted to buy , because when you finally agreed to pay out my claim , you sent the wrong dollar_amount , and i had even more time to shop because i waited even more days , for you to send additional compensation ,
negative	thank_you , squaretrade , for giving me a new base - line for what horrible customer service really is .
negative	i live in the usa , and placed my order a week in advance to be delivered in paris to my girlfriend .
negative	not only we ' re my flowers not delivered at all and valentines_day ruined , it is now the 00th and still no flower delivery .
negative	the customer service is terrible , i '_ve received 0 response per day , and usually at around 0 :_00am then nothing for the rest of the day .. and still they have yet to resolve my issue , or even contact their " own " florists .
negative	if i could give less then 0_star i would , please if you want your special_occasion to be special , choose another company to place your order with .
negative	i think the fault is with your delivery company .
negative	as a example i ordered some e_- ciggerets and they arrived the next_day .
negative	but your delivery company has lost 0 massage_table and i think delivered one to another address .
negative	totally spoiled christmas for my wife
negative	you ' d think it would be simple to make a repeat order .
negative	it took me almost a week and it was such a nightmare for me that i almost gave up .
negative	it would have been easier to place the job elsewhere .
negative	i talked to someone on the online_chat system to try and sort it out .
negative	i think that he was specially selected to do this because of his uncanny ability to not be able to answer any simple question .
negative	it was like he was copying pieces of random text from some type of script in a hope that somewhere you would find what you were looking for .
negative	i finally got sent a quote for the repeat new job .
negative	this was over double the price on the website and didn_'_t make any sense at all .
negative	0th_april_0000
negative	it '_s hard to believe that a company can be so repeatedly incompetent .
negative	solopress are driving us insane .
negative	the last time that we ordered from them it proved a nightmare to place a re - order .
negative	they then sent us a quote for a completely made up amount ( more than double what it said on the website ).
negative	this time , we uploaded our job to their website , this took almost 00_minutes as it was a large file .
negative	the site then told us that we could press the button to proceed to the next page , which we did .
negative	on the next page the site then told us that we had not uploaded anything .
negative	we tried twice more but with the same results ( that '_s 00_mins .
negative	so_far ).
negative	the file was 00mb and the maximum according to the site was 000mb so well within the limits .
negative	to get around this mess of a website , save_yourself time and don_'_t even try to upload an imaged .
negative	complete the order then email it to them .
negative	phew !
negative	it only took about 00_mins to place an order with them !
negative	yay !
negative	well , yay that is until we receive the invoice for the job .
negative	the job was about £_00 .
negative	the invoice ( in the email ) was for £ 0 and was also missing our company name , so not a valid invoice .
negative	so what should have been a simple order took 00_minutes to place and is now going to waste even more of our time ( again ) trying to get an invoice for the amount that we actually paid .
negative	to summarise , solopress are useless with numbers .
negative	take_care on their website as it can be a big time waster .
negative	carefully check any quotes , receipts or anything_else with numbers in from them .
negative	in summary , if you have plenty of time to waste ordering something that should be very simple , then give them a go , you won_'_t be disappointed .
negative	we are an existing xln customer .
negative	we are moving our phone lines 0 doors away .
negative	in order to move our broadband we require a job code for the broadband company .
negative	xln are useless .
negative	each time that i call i am put on hold and the phone_call takes a about 00_minutes .
negative	i am them transferred to the wrong department several_times .
negative	i have done this 0 times now and as a result know which department i need to talk to , but they still transfer me to the wrong departments .
negative	i keep talking to the same wrong people .
negative	they keep trying to transfer me to the right department who then insist on transferring me back the the wrong department despite my protests .
negative	i have gone_through this 0 times now and each time i spend up to 00_minutes on the phone .
negative	just to make it even worse , according to the broadband company they keep giving me the wrong company and i have to keep calling back .
negative	if i have to go through this again i will simply ask to be transferred to their cancellation department .
negative	additional note_: thanks for the comment xln .
negative	unfortunately i was given the incorrect number on two occasions which is why i kept phoning back .
negative	i never did receive the correct number resulting in a four day loss of broadband for our company .
negative	i ordered four parts for two different cars and after a week never received one of them .
negative	when i called to try and correct this and get a refund i was put on hold never able to talk with anyone .
negative	as i listend to the recording to complete the request online and they would get back to me .
negative	they are not very quick to respond , i am waiting to hear back from a request i made three_days ago .
negative	if they would improve their shipping and customer service it would be great .
negative	a week to ship a part from new_jersey is bad !
negative	really don_'_t understand the ratings visiondirect are getting on this site as every other site i have visited have had the total opposite .
negative	parents ordered me glasses on the 00th_december as a christmas_present and as of today it has yet to arrive .
negative	first issue was that my parents were instructed that the initial payment did not go through and were instructed to make an_additional payment via_paypal which they did .
negative	when their statement arrived from the bank they realised the credit_card payment did in fact go through .
negative	refund received so no significant issue there other than the inconvenience and delay caused .
negative	second issue is the fact that my item is still outstanding and i have sent numerous email enquiring as to the status .
negative	per their tracking_system the item has_been confirmed for a few weeks now with no change .
negative	mostly my emails go unanswered but when they do answer ( which is not often ), i get the generic response of ' customer service is important to us ' and ' thank_you for your patience ' but the matter never gets resolved .
negative	i received one email that confirmed my item would be received at their distribution outlet on the 00 january but this obviously hasn_'_t happened .
negative	visiondirect state delivery within 0 - 00 days but for me ( and many others from what i can see on different sites ) it has almost been a month now .
negative	i have ordered from many sites online and have never experienced this level of dissatisfaction and frustration .
negative	i saw after a few posts that they have left a servicemanager email , which i have also contacted but still no response .
negative	time to go to paypal and get this mess sorted once and for all and i will make_sure none of my friends get messed around by this shambles of a company
negative	be_careful to read terms and conditions on delivery particulalrly for large items !!!
negative	under terms and conditions they state " for palletised deliveries , the goods will be delivered as close as possible to your front_door ".
negative	we ordered a smal basin and wall mounted cabinet ( which came on a pallet - why a pallet i don_'_t know ?)
negative	and driver required us to take from van across the road .
negative	i hate to think what we would have done if it had been a big item !
negative	!
negative	spoke to delivery company and they insisted they only deliver to kerb and i should speak to betterbathrooms .
negative	driver said he often gets this problem with betterbathrooms orders .
negative	we live in apartment block ( with large lift ) so its debatable what consitutes " my front_door " but picking - up from across the road is certainly not close to my front_door .
negative	note that you have 00_minutes to review goods before driver leaves which you will need to cart your goods to your property and inspect !
negative	thankfully the goods were ok .
negative	betterbathrooms promised to investigate but refused any form of compensation even if they failed to fulfill their contractual obligations .
negative	i received a phone_call later the same day after it was escalalted to be told that delivery accross the road on the kerb was reasonable under the terms of their agreement .
negative	frankly , i wouldn_'_t do_business with them again .
negative	buyer_beware !
negative	!
negative	was sent the wrong items , was given no reasoning for this basic error .
negative	when they finally processed the error and tried to send me the correct items , they were now out of stock of one of the items .
negative	terribly ridiculous service and will never use again !
negative	we placed an order april 0th and did not receive email to confirm or order , so we placed another order on april_00th .
negative	we received the 0st order on april_00th .
negative	when we received the second order we returned it to you on may 0st .
negative	we have called with no answer .
negative	we have sent email '_s through the customer service 0 times in a week with no response .
negative	now it says there are no more customer service tickets available so we can '_t send in a complaint ???
negative	next step is to contact our credit_card .
negative	it has now been ten days since my order was confirmed and i still have not received the items ordered .
negative	what opinion do you think i might have ?
negative	if you are here to get me excited then you are about to get a really good story .
negative	my order was put in on 0 / 0 .
negative	the stock that i chose was all " in stock " and none was even on a " ships in 0 - 0 days ".
negative	so i put the order in and paid for it .
negative	idiot !!!
negative	!
negative	a week went by , nothing .
negative	another went by , still nothing .
negative	i sent an_email , nothing .
negative	i sent another email , still nothing .
negative	i tried to call and got a very polite " we are too_busy to answer your call so please call again ".
negative	i tried to call agin , nothing .
negative	i tried several_times again and guess what ?
negative	nothing !!.
negative	the date now is 0_weeks after i have ordered and paid for my " in stock " goods and have got ................. nothing .
negative	subsequently i sent another email and finally someone took notice and actually replied .
negative	the order was cancelled and nothing has_been delivered !!
negative	i have learnt something about golfstoreeurope . com and their service from my last experience and that is that there is no use complaining_about the service as there is none !!!!
negative	no sorry , please order again and we will give you express service , no compensation and definitely no_idea of how to run a business based on service .
negative	i can buy these goods anywhere and i will tell you that is exactly where i will be buying them , anywhere but golfstoreeurope . com .
negative	very angry once again !
negative	!
negative	purchased assassins_creed black flag season_pass at a cheap price only to find out why it was cheap the hard way .
negative	i thought i was getting the pass for xbox but the code didn_'_t work .
negative	i emailed to say code was wrong and they replied_saying it wasn_'_t an xbox code .
negative	whatever the code is for , it is not what i ordered and is useless to me .
negative	i have emailed back asking for the item i wanted or a full_refund but feel i '_m wasting my time .
negative	i would like to say the issue is now resolved , but it isn_'_t and i fear i have wasted my hard_earned money by trading with a substandard company with little or no care about resolving complaints .
negative	we lost through paypal over £ 0 , 000 through chargebacks .
negative	taking 0 payments on the same card with difference delivery addresses and customer names !!
negative	they did not notify us of any risk until the first charge backs came through the door 0 months later .
negative	00 one days_later we only have £ 0000 to pay back on the chargebacks .
negative	they then converted it into dollars and to bump it up to £ 0000 .
negative	making a cheeky profit .
negative	got to love paypal .
negative	for all small business please use worldpay or sage - pay as paypal really do not give a monkeys about taking online card payment or the security of these payments as they are only interested in the promotion of the paypal system - a total let_down to their customers who also take card payments .
negative	our clubs arrived late with no warning , not because they were picked_up late but because they weren_'_t " scanned in ".
negative	so after they were picked_up , i get a phone_call asking if they were picked_up because they had no record of them being scanned into the system .
negative	that doesn_'_t make you feel good , but if thought it was a fluke .
negative	now , today , i got the same call , statng the font know if out clubs were picked_up for the return trip , because again , they haven_'_t been " scanned in ".
negative	we are already home and i have no_idea where my clubs are or if i will get them anytime_soon .
negative	completely unreliable and seems disorganized .
negative	the provided code for itunes did not work , complained to apple , they want to see the original purchase receipt which of course i didn_'_t receive from pc_game_supply .
negative	total_rip_off !
negative	ordered the material i needed from their website .
negative	after_placing the order , i mean selecting pay , i find out shipping_costs are enormous .
negative	i call back to ask a question , after negotiating through phone message purgatory , i get disconnected .
negative	other_places may sell you the same product for more money - use them !
negative	when i placed my order , all of the party '_s were in stock and available .
negative	i paid for second day shipping so i could have the parts on the weekend for repair .
negative	when the parts didn_'_t show up , i called to find out why .
negative	parts_geek told me one of my parts was not available and they cancelled my order without informing_me .
negative	i am very disappointed with the way my order was handled .
negative	we signed_up on may 0th .
negative	have had nothing but trouble since day one .
negative	have another tech at the house today and he seems to not know either .
negative	this is definitely not a service id recommend to my friends or family
negative	you send me a broken part and expect me to pay return shipping , and wait 00 days for a refund , also charge me a core_charge with no way to return core , you suck .
negative	i '_ve had bad_experiences with travelocity in the past , and said i wouldn_'_t use the service again .
negative	for some reason i did this time around , but this was literally the last_straw .
negative	i actually waited a couple of months to write this review so i had time to calm down .
negative	if i had written my review right after it happened , i would have probably been using some choice four letter words to accompany my rant .
negative	to sum it up ... the customer service is absolutely horrendous and they could care less about their customers .
negative	when i first began using travelocity ( years_ago ), you could call if there was a problem and they would resolve it for you quickly and easily .
negative	that was the big benefit of the service .
negative	now it is more price driven … turned into who has the lowest_price tickets with crappy customer care - and to be honest the other travel sites have all the same prices , so what is the benefit of going with travelocity ??
negative	god_forbid you have to call for any reason , because you are automatically routed to a call_center in india .
negative	i should note that i ’ m in sales , so i speak very clearly with no accent , and they still can '_t understand me .
negative	also the person that answers the phone is so low on the totem pole that they have no power to do anything .
negative	no matter who you ask to speak to , or how " high up the ladder " you go , it ’_s still some person in india and ultimately they have no decision_making power .
negative	the long and short of it is … my wife and i got to the airport , made it through the line , and up to the check in counter exactly 00_minutes before our flight left .
negative	we were then told by the delta agent checking us in that , because we were checking luggage , the minimum time to check in was 0 hour .
negative	we asked to speak to a supervisor to see if there was anything they could do since it was only 0 minutes difference .
negative	this took her 00_minutes to finally come_back with a supervisor .
negative	the supervisor informed us that there is a grace_period and the absolute latest is 00_minutes .
negative	which we had been there in time for … but the original agent didn_'_t check us in because she didn_’ t know about it !
negative	we were then informed that we have to rebook and get on the next flight .
negative	once at the rebooking counter , we are told that there is a later flight that day but that it would cost us $ 0000 each to change to it !
negative	this was stressful , but nothing compared to the conversation i then had to have with the indian woman on the other end of the phone when i called travelocity .
negative	she was absolutely no help whatsoever , she was hard to understand , and seemed to get confused very easily .
negative	after explaining our situation to her for the 0th time , she told me that she could only give me a credit for a future travelocity purchase , and that she said that she needed 0 hours lead time to book another flight for us which basically meant going home and coming_back the next_day .
negative	this not only was not an option , but also ( according to her ) would cost us almost $ 0000 as well !
negative	after a very confusing 00 minute phone_call with her - i felt we had just run out of options and my wife was on the verge of tears , so i told her to cancel our reservation and give me the credit , and i would have to figure something out on my own since she apparently couldn ’ t manage to .
negative	she then informed me that because our flight had already left ( literally 0 minutes before ) that she cannot cancel it or issue a credit .
negative	so you basically kept me on the phone just long enough to where i couldn ’ t get my money back ??
negative	i was irate !
negative	i asked for a supervisor and was placed on hold for 00_minutes … then she came back and told me it would be a little while longer .
negative	another 00_minutes went by and i was fuming .
negative	luckily we found an angel of a woman at a delta booth that was able to rebook us on a flight 0 hours_later that day and only charge us a $_00 re - booking_fee .
negative	why is travelocity so incompetent and unwilling to help ?
negative	they care nothing for keeping their customers happy or helping them at all .
negative	they save_money by employing these indian call centers and have turned the business to crap in the process .
negative	look at the reviews online and you will see that i '_m one of thousands of people that are sick and tired of this company .
negative	i would absolutely love to have someone contact me from travelocity and explain_why the company is run this way – or at_least apologize !
negative	i plan to tell_everyone i know ( friends , family , colleagues , clients , people on the street ) to stay far far away from travelocity .
negative	not only did they send me the wrong part for a different car they are giving me problems returning the product .
negative	i do not recomend this company to anyone .
negative	dont_waste your time find a different seller .
negative	i ordered front_rotors for my f - 000 dually - they were listed as fitting my dually and they were listed as brembo brand .
negative	they arrived in avery short time , which i was happy to see .
negative	when i opened the box , the rotors were the wrong ones - they fit a single rear_wheel truck and the rotors were some bo bo brand i ' d never_heard of before .
negative	now i '_m tasked with returning the wrong parts , and i need to pay for shipping to return them .
negative	you never get to talk to anyone as the phone_number ( which i had to search for since its not listed on any of the pages of the website ) is connected only to voice_mail .
negative	all contact is done through email only .
negative	impersonal and unsatisfactory .
negative	i will never use them again .
negative	don_'_t be lured by the low_prices .
negative	i ordered some parts in early march and i haven_'_t received my order .
negative	i tried_emailing them but i never got a respond .
negative	i had ordered parts from a different site ( eparts ) but decided to try out this site .
negative	this site doesn_'_t compare to eparts . com or parts train . com .
negative	i will never use this site because of its terrible service nor do i recommend it .
negative	i ordered a radiator for my car , it arrived damaged .
negative	i can '_t get a hold of anyone , there is no contact information nobody is responding to my emails , i can '_t even reply to emails .
negative	$_000 down the drain .
negative	the parts are ordered from wholesale places that aren_'_t affiliated with parts_geek , so i can '_t even open a claim with ups !!!
negative	i got screwed !!
negative	!
negative	i ordered a part , they sent me the wrong part .
negative	no big_deal , i '_ll just send it back and they will send me the part i ordered .
negative	well to my surprise i had to pay 00 dollars to send the part back , this is the part i didn " t order .
negative	now i received a email_saying they can '_t find any information on my order and send them the part number and invoice , i did that three_days ago and i haven_'_t heard a word back from them .
negative	i dont_know if i accidentally orderded the wrong part or you guys sent me something different .
negative	i didnt like your returns process , it made me feal that even if i ordered the wrong part you guys didnt care about having your customers satisfied .
negative	i paid about 00 dollars for my part , had to return it paid 00 dollars to send it back , hopefully i get my money back .
negative	at the same time i had to order the correct part again and paid another 00 for it .
negative	you guys need customer service in phone 00 / 0 so when something like this happens the customer gets assisted right_away not by email and dont even get help .
negative	i would never buy something over 00 dollars with you guys , i just dont want this to happen to me again
negative	staff can be abrupt sometimes , seat very uncomfortable .
negative	dont wanna help you , sorry ?
negative	after processing my order and taking the money from my credit_card .
negative	the telling_me you will not deliver the bbq because it was an overseas credit_card .
negative	is absolutely rediculous .
negative	the transaction was verified by visa and confirmed by me .
negative	if you are not going to accept a card then surely you decline the order at time of payment .
negative	very stupid security policy !
negative	i received 0 mirrors to attach to my cars and when i opened the boxes from china
negative	i found no hardware to attach
negative	i have used website in the past with no_problems , however , my last transaction was less_than satisfactory .
negative	after recieving my replacement_mirror for my truck i tried contatcing them by phone , which they have no number listed on their website , red_flag number one .
negative	was instructed to contact them via their website which i did , but was only given an_rma_number to return my order .
negative	my issue was that the part sent was either manufactured incorrectly or they sent the wrong part .
negative	i wished to speak to a salesperson about this to see what my options were .
negative	after finally finding a phone_number via a forum site , called and was on hold for 0 . 00_hours listening to a prerecorded message , basically they never answer the phone .
negative	have heard these same complaints from many other dissatisfied customers who have had the same experience when trying to return parts .
negative	they will take the part back , after you are out the shipping_charges , for their error and then they slap you with a restocking_fee .
negative	never again for this consumer !
negative	my phone was never unlocked and i waited over a month with no response after many inquiries i sent .
negative	wouldnt recommens them to anyone ypu cant get in touch with anyone there at all i orderd parts then got rid of car and they would not cancell order will not ever do_buisness again
negative	first and last time i '_m shopping online , had a total nightmare experience , got told false_information about a sleeping_bag ( mountain_equipment / titan 000 s / s0000 model ) i was wanting to buy this model sleeping_bag which i seen a picture of this bag on taunton leisures website which is currently still online now 00 / 00 / 0000 .
negative	then i rang the shop and spoke to a man and asked_him if this was the bag i was getting i . e .
negative	the titan 000 s / s00 model which was on your website with orange zips with photos as i was buying it to replace the same model .
negative	the guy reassured me that this was the model i was getting ( the one with the orange zip ) however when i received it , it wasn_'_t the same one i wanted which was on your website and what the man had confirmed to me .
negative	so therefore i had to pay for the sleeping_bag to be returned as taunton_leisure don_'_t refund the postage , even_though it wasn_'_t my fault and wasted my time as it was a replacement late christmas_present .
negative	i have contacted them , but they said they can '_t refund the postage , so will not be shopping online at taunton again , due to this bad_experience through no fault of my own .
negative	the stupid driver can '_t find the address .
negative	this is business address not personal address .
negative	all delivery company like ups , usps , dhl can find this address easily .
negative	only stupid fed - ex driver can not find the address .
negative	we received the incorrect parts and there is no way to get in contact with them .
negative	their customer service page has_been down for a month and we have tried to call and there was never any answer .
negative	still have parts that need returned .
negative	confirmed that they could come to my house and put new tyres on .
negative	then half an_hour later rang and said that the tyres were not in stock !
negative	having taken just under_£_000 from my account straight_away i had to wait 0_weeks and several phone_calls before i got my money back .
negative	never again .. what kind of company doesn_'_t provide tracking_numbers ?
negative	i got the runaround for days ..
negative	home_security store sold me two previously opened boxes with parts missing in both .
negative	if this were a face - to - face transaction this type of dishonesty would / could not occur - you could see they were taking_advantage of you .
negative	but on the web , apparently , being dishonest is ok for the home_security store .
negative	when i commented about this on their facebook_page they removed their page entirely !
negative	i '_m guessing this is the only way they can respond effectively - digging deeper into the low ground they '_ve already established .
negative	i would not recommend this doing_business with this store .
negative	they are worse than the sneak - thieves they purport to discourage with their security products .
negative	part were sent fast but it was wrong part sent .
negative	having hard time contacting part geek to find out how to return part and have them send correct part .
negative	parts_geek showed the part i was looking for in stock .
negative	i placed the order , in which there was no_hassle in them taking my money , via credit_card .
negative	then i got an e_- reciept .
negative	two_days_later i recieved a shipping_label notification .
negative	that was three_weeks_ago !
negative	the part still_hasn_'_t been shipped , according to the tracking_number on the lable !
negative	i tried_contacting parts_geek , to avail !
negative	can not talk to anyone !
negative	i am contemplating canceling the visa charge .
negative	and let them keep their damn part !!!
negative	i rate this company with a big fat ' 0 ' and you would have better luck getting parts from the junk_yard !
negative	lidt træt af at der_ikke_var prisgaranti på fifa_00 , samtidig virkede spillet ikke og de fortæller mig at der_ikke_er noget galt og sender det gamle tilbage - hvilket stadig_ikke virker .
negative	**** ing dårlig kundeservice .
negative	i ordered a license_plate bracket for the front of my new vehicle ... waited over a week , checking the website for shipping status daily .
negative	after a week had passed i finally get a notification saying that my money is being refunded because the part is out of stock .
negative	it took a week to let_me know that ?
negative	i '_ve been waiting almost a week for my refund now .
negative	i still don_'_t have the part i need and i was just issued a violation warning by my local state troopers because my plate is improperly displayed .
negative	fortunately it won_'_t cost me any money ... but it could have been avoided .
negative	i saw several online reviews of the customer service setup they have , all were derogatory ... i can now add my name to the list .
negative	i had high_hopes .
negative	i will not use parts_geek again nor will i recommend them to any of my friends .
negative	take_note .
negative	in todays business world you often only get one chance ... parts_geek ... you just blew yours .
negative	i ordered an evaporator for my blazer from their e_- catalog .
negative	the photo of the correct evaporator was shown so i ordered that part .
negative	the part description matched the photo also .
negative	when i received my part it was the wrong evaporator .
negative	it was the evaporator in the next photo in the e_- catalog which had a different part number .
negative	there was no way to cross_reference the part number on the manufacturer '_s box to the part number in the partsgeek e_- catalog .
negative	you have to reley on them to get it right .
negative	beware !
negative	the manufacturer '_s box inside the shipping box was damaged and the outer shipping box was not .
negative	so the damage occured before the manufacturer '_s box was placed into the shipping box .
negative	the manufacturer '_s packaging inside their box was inadequate also as the evaporator was loose and flopping around inside their box .
negative	getting a wrong part is frustrating but happens .
negative	what is unacceptable is when calling their customer_support number a computer or fax_machine answers .
negative	it is impossible to speak to a real_person .
negative	you must send an_email to them which may take up to 00_hours to reply to ( according to them ).
negative	are they having that many problems in customer_support that it takes 0 days to reply ?
negative	i sent an_email on 0 / 00 at 00 : 00 am and they did not reply until 00 / 00 at 0 : 00_pm .
negative	seems to me that is over 00_hours .
negative	what is also unacceptable is i had to pay for return shipping .
negative	i am waiting on my credit invoice ( which they say may take up to 00 days ( it takes seconds to deduct from my account so why does it take 00 days to credit it ??))
negative	to see if they deducted the initial shipping and a restocking_fee from my credit .
negative	if so , then this outfit , my bank and i are going to go round and round and i will make certain the 000 + automotive students i associate with each year are forewarned about this place .
negative	fyi .
negative	i then ordered another evaporator from another supplier - rockauto ( which i have done a lot of business with ) and they shipped me the wrong evaporator also .
negative	however the manufacturer '_s box and catalog was mis_- labeled and not their fault .
negative	i reached a csr on the first call , was never in a hold queue , got the problem taken_care of on one call and they even sent me a prepaid return shipping_label to return the wrong evaporator .
negative	it is my perception that partsgeek is a fly by night operation with a minimum staff and very little concern about return customers .
negative	i will be more than willing to change my perception and not spread negativity about them if they had a real_person to speak to and actually provided anything close to customer service .
negative	until that time , partsgeek will never get another cent of my money and i will spread the word at the local technical college where i am associated with the automotive technology program training future automotive technicians to avoid this place .
negative	i bought a book 0_weeks_ago and have not received it yet .
negative	i will not use bookbyte ever again .
negative	things aren_'_t true to size and there is no communication when it comes to out of stock items
negative	the part sent to me would not work .
negative	it could not be installed by a professional auto shop .
negative	in order to discover this i had to pay shipping both_ways , a 00_% restocking_fee and deal with a slow and cumbersome return_authorization process .
negative	the fees i had to pay were equal to about 00_% of the cost of the worthless part .
negative	never again .
negative	dit is mijn 0e bestelling bij iwonatec .
negative	de geleverde goederen zijn uitstekend tegen_een gunstige prijs .
negative	het verpakkingsmateriaal is echter waardeloos .
negative	het piepschuim breekt bij_de geringste aanraking in duizenden bolletjes uit elkaar .
negative	het opruimen van_de puinhoop na het openen van slechts één door kostte mij een uur .
negative	whilst there was nothing wrong with the car delmar booking service as they delivered a good service but you need to on your toes when dealing_with the car providers .
negative	after standing in the line at the europcar desk for 00_minutes you virtually brain dead by the time you get seen by someone that you can hardly understand .
negative	i was told that i needed to take out additional insurance and also advised to pay for my fuel up front to avoid delays when returning the car , what i was not told was that the insurance was actually a ' serenity pack ' ( cost 000_euros ) and that there was a re - fuelling charge .
negative	the end_result was that a 00 day rental for a renault clio started out at 000_euros but actually cost me a final figure of 000 . 00 euros .
negative	this is not the first time that i have fallen victim to europcar '_s deceptive charges but it is the last , i will never have another car from them .
negative	the shipping of your order is fine just do not order a part with a core_deposit .
negative	i have been waiting for a week to find out where to ship a core back to .
negative	nobody ever answers a phone at parts_geek , there is nothing on their website about returning a core and there are no instructions with the purchased product about returning a core .
negative	i have purchased from other online_retailers with core deposits and the instructions come with your purchased product .
negative	delivery took 0_weeks , charged_twice for the transition lens option , unable to resolve via phone and email , as a last_resort i filed a “ dispute charges ” with my credit_card company .
negative	was told three_times someone will phone you back to resolve your issues with no return calls .
negative	this is the last time for me with this company .
negative	i bought a front_bumper for my son '_s birthday , and i waited for atleast 0_weeks , and it never came in .
negative	i checked my e_-_mail and it said my transaction was refunded ....
negative	gave my hopes up !
negative	expensive price compare to other similar web_site like as shopical . com
negative	i order online but have a bad_experience .
negative	my order is not received at the corresponding time .

negative	you don_'_t even deserve one star .
negative	i '_ll never order anything from partsgeek again .
negative	you have had payment - - $_000 . 00 - - for ten days and i still don_'_t have my part .
negative	maybe you ought to figure_out a better shipping method with my hard - earned money ; if and when i get the part , i hope you sent the correct one .
negative	partsgeek is a loser ,
negative	i bought a sink from this company , a very good quality one , and they sent it out without fixing clips .
negative	i noticed this and i asked them to send some .
negative	they did so within 0 days .
negative	unfortunately i later found they had sent the wrong ones , something i was not aware of , not being a plumber .
negative	by the time it became_apparent i had fitters in the house re fitting my kitchen and the whole job was held up for want of these clips .
negative	nothing , it seems to me , is urgent to these_people and to talk to someone via their premium line is very very costly indeed .
negative	you have to go via_e_mail which is slow .
negative	the clips arrived several days_later , a day after promised , this time the right ones .
negative	however taps uk cost me a lot of additional money and a great deal of stress indeed .
negative	they placed the blame on their supplier .
negative	i could say more , but will leave it at that and will pursue compensation without_any great hope .
negative	i honestly wish i had never seen their advert .
negative	would i buy again from them - no .
negative	should you buy from them , read my review and then decide !
negative	on 0 / 00 / 00 i contacted customer_support to both howard_johnson and booking . com to settle a dispute i had with the front receptionist , who claimed to be the manager of the place , that the daily standard rate that i had booked through booking . com did not match the amount of days in which i stayed .
negative	a total of $_000 . 00 was shown in my invoice for a booking of 0 days , when adjusted to the booking . com daily rate of $_00 . 00 (_excluding tax ) should be $_000 . 00 .
negative	during the duration from 0 / 00 / 00 - 0 / 0 / 0000 i was charged two different rates : the original booking . com rate of $_00 . 00 and then another rate of $_00 . 00 .
negative	including taxes the original 0 day stay through booking . com came out to be $_000 . 00 due to weather_conditions preventing us from leaving the new brunswick , nj howard_johnson branch , we had to book an_additional 0 days .
negative	unfortunately , i understand that rates done directly through the source , this case being howard_johnson and not booking . com , can differ from doing it through a third - party source - when i am being charged for a 0 night_stay at $_000 . 00 including taxes through howard_johnson for 0 days this does not make_sense .
negative	how can a hotel adjust their rates so sporadically and not be considered fraudulent when third - party companies promoting howard_johnson are buying out customers to figure_out through their own mistake that they have booked with a hotel branch that does not take its customers / occupants seriously enough to match those prices or compensate them .
negative	0 / 00 / 00 , the entire north_east corridor , primarily new_jersey , new_york , and pennsylvania will be expecting gusts of over 00 / 00 mph and snow of 00 - 00 inches and i am left with the only option to remain here for an_additional two_days at the discretion of the hotel staff who has belittled my requests to understand_why i was being charged infrequent rates , whether i could speak to a manager or not , whether the hotel was going to be operating through this snowstorm , and if i can have a representative of booking . com speak with the receptionist of howard_johnson .
negative	all these requests were not met and i am left with no other alternative but to pay through a third_party , as i refuse to have to pay the rate which is nowhere advertised in the hotel and fluctuates from $_00 to $_00 , to lastly , $_00 in a matter of two_weeks .
negative	one can only hope that my room can stay the same , since the daily rate does not .
negative	on top of it all , i '_m being shouted at and lied to for simply asking why the room rate is changing .
negative	when is this attitude ever appropriate to a paying customer ?
negative	made a reservation at cherry blossoms hotel in manila for my wife .
negative	checked off on twin beds , paid same rate as on cb website to agoda .
negative	wife gets billed $_00 by cb for extra bed , was assigned to a queen room .
negative	you cannot choose superior twin_room using agoda website , agoda says " sorry ".
negative	why use their site when you can get the same rate at hotel site and be able to chose specific room type (" superior twin "), which you cannot do on agoda ?
negative	be_careful if you use agoda for booking .
negative	pissed ....
negative	will not use again .
negative	person that answered the phone is a novice when it comes to wine , but the worst part was that she was indifferent to the customer '_s needs .
negative	i had some specific_requirements .
negative	she was uninterested in understanding my concerns .
negative	her youth showed in that she was more interested in having a quick response to my questions without understanding what i was really asking .
negative	she had difficulty listening .
negative	she was too eager to speak .
negative	she got the order wrong , many because she did not understand my concern about shipping wine , which led me to cancel the order .
negative	this was a test - run , as i had not ordered from saratoga before .
negative	i will not be ordering wine from saratoga again until there is a wine professional on the other end of the phone who undertands wine and its fragile nature .
negative	i bought a deal through groupon .
negative	it was a total disaster .
negative	took approx 0 months and 00 emails from me to resolve the issue and get my product
negative	well , i will say i wasn ’ t impressed but it is what it is .
negative	parts_geek is a drop shipper , so you get what you pay for as far as customer service is concerned .
negative	customer service input form is really lame if you have issues with your order , no way to call and actually contact someone if your order goes bad .
negative	i ordered the first few_times with good results .
negative	this last one was really bad though .
negative	i ordered a bumper , fender flare , and turn_signal for my 0000_jeep_liberty .
negative	the problem was due to it being an oversized item , so i was charged a rather steep cost for shipping ( so i thought , but i think the rest of my review explains the shipping cost ).
negative	not a problem if you are getting it in a reasonable time .
negative	it took over two_weeks to arrive , and the shipping service used was called roderunner , and it was drop shipped from a place called keystone autoparts in charlotte .
negative	the packaging was really bad ( and didn_’ t contain my parts ), no packing_material , box falling_apart .
negative	kind of sketchy .
negative	i don ’ t hold the shipper responsible too much .
negative	the email sent contained a link to track my package that didn_’ t work , unless you toggled back to your email , retrieved the shipping number and manually put it in .
negative	if you are lucky_enough to figure this out you can see if it has shipped and when it is supposed to arrive .
negative	really not of much use since the parts were so late .
negative	the delivery service also required a call to set_up delivery , so not really convenient for someone working full time and having to be present when the parts arrive .
negative	after my first order was corrected , they told me to throw_away the parts since it would cost too much to send back ( i got a grille surround for a f000 ).
negative	so i was stupid enough to get my money back and order again .
negative	the second time i got all the right parts but again it took over two_weeks for them to arrive .
negative	oh and the other buyer_beware thing i should mention , i had ordered from partsgeek before and got a $_00 off coupon in my email for spending more than $_000 .
negative	my order didn_'_t quite meet the limit so i added a few more items , and it still didn_'_t meet the limit .
negative	so their scam is they charge almost nothing for the parts , but charge almost everything on shipping , and shipping doesn_'_t count against the $_000 minimum order required .
negative	i am sure it has to do with the option to use paypal , since i heard the seller only has to pay a % of the purchase goods price and not the shipping cost .
negative	nice little loophole to screw the buyer in the end .
negative	so was the part quality ok ... yes .
negative	would i use them again ... no .
negative	and definitely not if i was in a rush to get the parts and had my car dismantled waiting for parts .
negative	hello ,
negative	i recently_purchased rat_poison from your company for obvious_reasons .
negative	i do have a night time video camera to monitor the poison site .
negative	very much surprised to note on the video that the rat avoided the poison on several_occasions .
negative	i did telephone your company regarding this disappointing result and it was suggested that the bait should be placed on the ground rather_than on a bench as had been done previously .
negative	the result was the same - complete disinterest in the product .
negative	your comments would be more than welcome .
negative	david curtis .
negative	after a great holiday came home to a clean car pity it had done 00 miles and a so called chauffeur so rude ?
negative	when asked about the mileage all he could say was well the car was cleaned .
negative	was going to choose this company until i read all the negative_reviews .
negative	thanks god for sites like this that a person can see before choosing a nightmare .
negative	i wrote on one item i was given a fake tracking_number on and still have yet to receive a refund .
negative	now i have a second order with the seller by the name of shenzhen , look at his feedback you will see he has done this the last few orders .
negative	i knew after 00 days when this tracking_number rf000000000sg singapore post could not still be tracked that there was a problem and looking at his feedback tells_me all i need to know .
negative	dhgate will use tactics to prolong the situation instead of doing the right thing by refunding they will give you runarounds and they actually told me i had to wait 00 - 00 days .
negative	no way will i wait 00 days meanwhile its too_late to file a chargeback .
negative	this seller even had a dhgate guarantee which is why i think dhgate is backing the seller so much because they would have to give me $_00 on each item ordered from this seller .
negative	i want my money back on orders 0000000000 and 0000000000 for a total of $_000 . 00 checked usps customs and receiving and was told the tracking_number has not entered the us , which even more confirmed my gut_feeling .
negative	atten ripped_off buyers .
negative	file a chargeback with dhgate if they give you a runaround , enough of these chargebacks will hurt their business and make them do a better job at enforcing rules and getting_rid of these worthless fraudulent sellers , who do nothing but waste our time .
negative	email from dhgate ridiculus have a look may 0th are they serious ?
negative	do not wait that long no matter what dhgate tells you to do just file a fraudulent chargeback ..
negative	regarding your dispute with order 0000000000 , your order was shipped via singaporepost .
negative	the tracking_number is rf000000000sg . singaporepost typically takes 00 to 00 days to arrive .
negative	if your order does not arrive by may . 0 , 0000 , we will_continue to process your order dispute .
negative	please wait more days patiently !
negative	we are still working to assist you !
negative	for additional assistance , please visit dhgate '_s help center .
negative	thank_you for continuing to be a dhgate valued_customer .

negative	would not use them again as the quality of goods was very poor .
negative	if you really are in no hurry to get your items ,
negative	then maybe they are not so bad .
negative	just don_'_t trust any overnight promises .
negative	also , don_'_t order
negative	paint from them .
negative	the transaction went good but when my wheel_hubs came in they were damaged .
negative	it took several days to get an_rma_number to send them back and on top of that i had to pay shipping .
negative	i don_'_t see me buying from them in the future .
negative	was very disappointed with the process .
negative	we picked out flights from columbus ohio to toronto and then direct to cancun .
negative	we specifically chose the pacakage based on the flight schedule that would allow us to leave on saturday am and arrive saturday pm .
negative	( similar on the return ).
negative	the flight was clearly_shown in the on line booking process but once we received the actaul itinerary the flights had been changed to a multiple stop flight schedule that now had us leaving on saturday arriving sunday_night .
negative	we immidiately called and spent about 00_minutes to 0 hour on the phone with vairous people the basic response was we cannot see the flights you are seeing ( we offered to email a screen print from bookit . com to validate our claim but this was not accepted .).
negative	after several unseccussful attempts to find a solution all of which either had us on multiple flights ( with 0 days travel there and 0 day travel back ) or increased coststhat were unacceptably high , we ened up canceling the reservation .
negative	then we needed to argue about why we should not be charge a cancellation_fee .
negative	as this was yesterday i am not confident that we will not be charged and will take according to bookit . com 0 - 00 business days for the hotel porption of the trip to be removed from my account .. now as of today the charge has not yet shown up so i will now need to monitor both when the charges show up and when they are removed which is just another aggrevation that has made this experience with bookit . com unacceptable
negative	i am doing a business trip and i am taking my family along .
negative	i booked my family flights through travelocity .
negative	the last leg of flight to my first destination got canceled and i was told i needed to wait 00_hours to hear back from the agent '_s supervisor in order to check alternatives .
negative	i need to change my own flights once i get the changes for my family '_s confirmed and i do not understand_why i need to wait 00_hours .
negative	we have some flexibility with dates and arriving / departing destination .
negative	i simply was not offered any alternatives .
negative	customer service is appaling
negative	i got the wrong part and a suck s
negative	parts came broken had to go to dealer for part because the car was leaving that day .. i will never order again from parts_geek .. the grill i ordered was cracked
negative	too much info just for minimal transfer , i dont need to give them that much of my identity even when it comes to funds ... are they protected themselves or me ?
negative	stay_away
negative	worse matching website - everything is fake without one shred of reality .
negative	they probably went on a rampage and took google pictures and posted those up
negative	they will not pay for shipping for my defective ac_compressor never shop again lost my business
negative	i honestly dont_know how this company has so many positive_reviews ( aside from the one that is one of their employees that is - coreleone ismail ).
negative	i ordered from these_guys as a leap of faith - and hit disaster .
negative	firstly i ordered mass_effect 0 - eu key - as it did not need to be modified like the russian_version did - plus this is what was advertised on their site .
negative	the order was delivered late due to supplier problems and it was then a russian_version - which i had to modify .
negative	not an eu_version as_advertised .
negative	due to late delivery people were promised a bonus - which was either a free game or a discount_voucher .
negative	a site admin also promised me an_additional " bonus " for being messed about .
negative	i thought this was fair .
negative	however apparently now this is not going to happen as the guy in charge believes in treating all customers equally - false_advertising isnt treating fairly - nor is giving so many people free games and the rest discounts .
negative	i will not be ordering from them again .
negative	i would suggest anybody_wanting cd_keys visit cjs or another reputable site and pay a little more money .
negative	a full week after taking my order you send me an_email_telling_me that you have authorised a refund since my daughters coat is now no_longer in stock not pleased !!!!!
negative	!
negative	i ordered a vlavle not a switch !
negative	!
negative	it was my mistake to order from this place .
negative	same stuff as available locally , but i got a defective set , my son cried about it .
negative	i tried to return or have them send the missing_pieces , but just got the run around .
negative	a heartless , useless company .
negative	anyone should stay_away who does not want headaches .
negative	still_waiting almost two_weeks for arrival of parts ordered from website .
negative	bought tire / wheel package from local store and that took almost three_weeks .
negative	i will not do_business with this organization again , nor would i recommend anyone_else do the same !
negative	there are a number of vendors who supply to this audience .
negative	håber du har god tid - for her starter en forrykt historie !
negative	min_søn købte i september måned sidste år en andelslejlighed på frederiksborgvej i københavns nord vest kvarter .
negative	en_god , men slidt lejlighed , som nærmest var et håndværkertilbud .
negative	det_eneste , der_var relativt nyt var " gasinstallationen " i køkkenet , der helt tydeligt var renoveret i forbindelse_med overgangen til " bygas 0 ", hvor_der af samme årsag var installeret et_nyt gaskomfur .
negative	gasmåleren var ret ny , og renovering af gasinstallationen lod sig afsløre i forskellen på lagene af maling på gasrørene .
negative	da min_søn og_jeg fjernede de gamle køkkenelementer og et ulovligt forsænket loft , som_ikke_havde_den rette brandklassifikation , bemærkede vi , at vi kunne lugte gas fra installationens hovedhane , når vi stående på_en stige fik næsen tæt på hovedhanen .
negative	hovehanen tilhører hofor jf .
negative	leverings betingelserne på_deres hjemmeside .
negative	jeg bad min_søn ringe_til hofor for at tilmelde sig , samt for at fortælle hofor , at deres hovehane ikke_var tæt .
negative	min_søn gjorde som_jeg_havde vejledt ham , og hofor oplyste ham om at han blot skulle kontakte en vvs installatør , for at få installationen gjort tæt .
negative	jeg_var noget tvivlende overfor dette svar , hvorfor jeg_kontaktede hofor og_fik kontakt_til_en venlig person ved telefonen .
negative	med henvisning til hofor_´_s egne leveringsbetingelser tvivlede jeg på , at det_var min_søns problem , at hovedhanen var utæt .
negative	nu var problemet ikke længer min_søns , og faktisk skulle problemet nu løse straks .
negative	nu var_det et_stort problem , at min_søn var taget til holte for at træne u00 drengene i håndbold .
negative	jeg beroligede hofor ’_s telefondame med at det kun var_en yderst beskeden mængde gas , der kom ud , og at man skulle have næsen meget tæt på hanen for at kunne lugte gassen .
negative	da gashanen ikke_var rørt af os , ligesom den_var groet fast og ikke_kunne aktiveres , ja så havde_den nok været utæt siden overgangen til bygas 0 , altså i flere_år .
negative	det beroligede ikke hofor tilstrækkeligt , og_det_blev aftalt , at jeg straks skulle kontakte hofor , når min_søn var tilbage fra håndboldtræningen i holte , så hofor ’_s vagt kunne udskifte hovedhanen til gasinstallationen .
negative	således aftalt ringede vi til hofor ved 0000 tiden samme aften .
negative	vagten i hofor gas blev underrettet om , at min_søn var til stede hos mig i emdrup 0 km væk , og at vi_var klar_til at køre ind i lejligheden .
negative	aftalen med vagten blev , at han ville kontakte sit personale og fastlægget et tidspunkt , som han ville underrette os om .
negative	en halv time senere blev vi kontaktet af_en_meget vred gasmand fra hofor , som stod ved døren til opgangen , hvor ingen svarede .
negative	vi blev lidt overraskede over at aftalen om at vi skulle underrettes om tidspunktet ikke blev overholdt , og blev også lidt overraskede over tonen og vreden fra hofor_´_s medarbejder .
negative	det_var jo hofor som synes det_var vigtigt at komme ind_til gasinstallationen .
negative	vi_var fremme ved lejligheden 0 minutter senere , og lukkede hofor_´_s medarbejder ind .
negative	medarbejderen medgav , at hovedhanen ikke_var tæt , hvorpå han fjernede både hovedhane og gasmåler .
negative	da_jeg spurgte , hvorfor han fjernede en relativt ny gasmåler , når aftale alene var at skifte hofor_´_s utætte hane , undlod han at svare .
negative	han proppede installationen af , og sagde , at nu var problemet med gaslugt løst !
negative	han forlod herefter lejligheden med gasmåleren og på_vej ud_af døren forklarede han , at min_søn nu kunne kontakte en vvs installatør , der kunne montere en_ny gashane og en_ny måler ??
negative	?
negative	målløs stod vi tilbage i en lejlighed , uden gasmåler , og med_et resultat , som_var langt fra det som hofor_´_s medarbejder havde stillet os i udsigt , da_vi oplyste , at deres gashane ikke_var tæt .
negative	jeg_kontaktede hofor den følgende dag , og spurgte , hvad_der_var_gået galt i forhold_til_den aftale som_jeg_havde lavet om at kontakte hofor_´_s vagt .
negative	jeg_blev herunder oplyst , at hofor_´_s medarbejder havde indberettet , at gasinstallationen var løs og uforsvarlig , hvorfor han havde fjernet gasmåleren .
negative	min_søns lejlighed var under renovering , og_vi_var i færd med at sætte glasvæv op_på de afrensede vægge i køkkenet .
negative	for at få_en pænt resultat var_der afmonteret to " rørbæringer " til gasrøret , så glasvæv kunne opsættes pænt bag gasrøret .
negative	dette_var_den_ene begrundelse for " uforsvarligheden ".
negative	rørbæringerne var afmonteret uden at manipulere med gasrøret , og de var til stede ved selve komfuret .
negative	montøren gjorde sig ikke den ulejlighed at trykprøve installationen .
negative	dette ville have taget ham et minut eller to .
negative	efter anmodning fik_jeg vejledning om klagemuligheder , og skrev en klage til hofor .
negative	her fik_jeg et_svar , hvor hofor medgav , at montørens kundevenlighed måske kunne have været bedre , men beskrivelsen af min_søns installation var nu yderligere forringet , idet selve målerens ramme var løs og gasmåleren var skæv .
negative	målerrammen er_meget solidt fastgjort - vi_har_ikke rørt den og_den sider rigtig godt fast .
negative	målerrammen har_været lidt skæv lige siden bygningen blev bygget , men selve gasmåleren var_helt lige .
negative	vi_har talrige fotos af gasmåleren , da_det_var_den nemmeste dokumentation ved ejerskifte og aflæsning af gasmåleren .
negative	hofor_´_s gasmontør har afgivet urigtige oplysninger til_den sag jeg_har klaget over , og sammenholdt med_den uforskammede behandling vi_fik , ja så kunne man ønske sig , at hofor ikke_havde et monopol på levering af gas i københavn .
negative	jeg_kontaktede efterfølgende telefonisk den medarbejder hos hofor , der havde svaret på_min klage , og oplyste begrundelsen for nedtagelse af måleren ikke_var korrekt , og at installationen kunne besigtiges , hvis hofor var i tvivl .
negative	ved min telefoniske kontakt , fik_jeg endnu et dårligt indtryk af hofor , og_jeg afsluttede samtalen med erkendelsen af , at kundeservice ikke_er_en_af hofor_´_s stærke kompetencer .
negative	bøjet i støvet har_jeg nu kontaktet 0 vvs installatører for at få genmonteret en gasmåler i min_søns lejlighed .
negative	en overflødig udgift der skønsmæssigt beløber sig til fire et halvt tusinde kroner .
negative	alle 0 vvs montører fra københavn , hellerup , virum og holte var_meget venlige og imødekomne .
negative	de spurgte alle til , hvilket forsyningsselskab det drejede sig om , og da_jeg oplyste , at det_var hofor bygas københavn takkede de alle nej til opgaven .
negative	med deres nej til at montere en gasmåler i min_søns lejlighed svarede de alle , at indtjeningen ved denne opgave ikke modsvarede opgavens kompleksitet .
negative	selv i vvs branchen har hofor et imageproblem , og_det ender nok med , at jeg_køber et_nyt komfur til_min_søn - til flaskegas og placeret flasken i garderobeskabet ved siden af komfuret .
negative	jeg_er selv ansat i en offentlig virksomhed , hvor_man rutinemæssigt kan klage_over medarbejdernes adfærd .
negative	en sådan klage afgøres af_en uvildig klagemyndighed .
negative	samme forhold kunne man ønske sig for det offentlige forsyningsmonopol hofor .

negative	boxer har budt mig på helt usædvanlig dårlig kundeservice_og_jeg skrev derfor et review her på_siden i efteråret med talrige begrundelser !
negative	efter det review blev_jeg for første_gang kontaktet af_en høflig og behagelig kvinde fra boxer , som gav mig en_god_oplevelse af boxer .
negative	jeg_blev kompenceret med fri boxer i december måned og efter dette virkede alle mine 0 boxer kort for første_gang , og de virkede hele december .
negative	vi aftalte , at hun skulle vende tilbage efter december måned , for at få_en status på om teknikken nu virkede og for at aftale fremtiden for mit boxer abonnement : o )
negative	på_samme tid betale vi i familien for 0 x boxer , da min samleverske havde et separat abonnement .
negative	den rare kvinde fra boxer vendte dog ikke tilbage_til_mig , og da_jeg_så ringede til boxer i marts for at slå vore dobbelt abonnement sammen til et , fik_jeg den besked , at dette ikke_kunne lade sig gøre !
negative	jeg_kunne slette det_ene abonnement !
negative	naturligvis ville jeg_så slette min samleverskes abonnement , som kun havde " et " kort .
negative	jeg_havde kort forinden købt to ekstrakort , så mit_abonnement dækkede " 0 " kort .
negative	jeg_fik derefter et meget ubehøvlet svar af_den person fra kundeservice som betjente mig -" jeg_var_helt slettet som_kunde , mine 0 kort var tabt , men_jeg_var velkommen til at starte forfra som ny kunde_hos boxer og betalt 0 . 000 ,- for 0 nye kort " !
negative	at vi samtidig betalte for et dobbelt abonnent gjorde ingen indtryk .
negative	glæden varede således kort - boxer vendte ikke tilbage som_aftalt - og mine 0 kort er gået tabt .
negative	det værste er dog den fornemmelse man_har når_man lægger telefonen efter_en ubehøvlet og dårlig behandling .
negative	jeg ønsker mig virkelig , at der kunne komme konkurrence på boxers monopol for luftbåret tv , for den behandling jeg_har_fået er ingen kunder værdige .
negative	hvis_jeg i mit job behandlede kunder og klienter på_samme måde ville jeg blive efterforsket , og_det_ville_blive udstedt en sanktion i relation til opførslen .

negative	called yesterday to check on a pump part that was put on backorder .
negative	after being on hold , the rep came back and told me that her_supervisor was " on the phone as we speak " with the vendor of the part .
negative	she confirmed my number and told me the supv .
negative	would call me right back .
negative	never_heard from them .
negative	my postcode was not included in their list of places they were unable to deliver next_day ( i live 00miles from the centre of glasgow ).

negative	i ordered an automatic_transmission_filter kit which includes a gasket and a filter for a 0000 isuzu trooper .
negative	the kit ordered from parts_geek took more than one week to arrive .
negative	wrong gasket , slow shipping and the customer has to pay the cost of return shipping , what could be worse ?
negative	ordered two items , long delay before told one out of stock , second item not delivered and although promised a full_refund have received nothing !
negative	do not use this company !
negative	i cancelled my sky account , the day before my payment date , thereby giving sky one full month and a days notice .
negative	i have been with sky on the full package since it started in 0000 .
negative	0 days before the package was to end , 00th of april , i was called by sky , who offered me a half price package for 00 months on all but my hd and espn subs , amounting to £_00 a month , instead of £_00 . 00 previously .
negative	i accepted the offer and expected it to come into effect 0 days_later on 00nd april my normal payment date .
negative	however instead the service disconnected .
negative	when i called to ask what the problem was , sky told me they had no recollection of " my call to them "?
negative	and that this offer was not available , but that i could have 00_% reduction for 00 months instead .
negative	as you can imagine under the circumstances , i refused the shabby offer .
negative	perhaps that might have been halved to00 and a half % 0 days_later , who_knows .
negative	i purchased parts almost a week and a half ago and i didn_'_t receive them or some number to put in a support_ticket .
negative	i go to try to track my order and a prompt pops_up saying they can '_t find my order .
negative	i paid almost $_000 for these parts and can '_t get in touch with anyone .
negative	dead bogus !!
negative	!
negative	i had a problem with the part that was delivered , had my car in the shop , torn down , without and working part and i could not reach anyone to get another part .
negative	i stayed on hold for over a half an_hour , submitted an online request for assistance , and left a voice_mail message .
negative	all the time , i am paying for shop space for a car with a defective_part .
negative	i will order next time from someone i can reach .

negative	the delivery service has not delivered , stating they were here but no one home on 0 occasions .
negative	no notice of delivery left and during one attempt in the evening we were home with two vehicles in the driveway , i would not use dhl ever they could use your customer service process for their delivery business .
negative	cdkeyhouse will deliver your key fast and cheap , but with these fast and cheap keys comes a ridiculous customer_support staff .
negative	if you ' re willing to risk receiving a russian or polish key whilst being told you ordered an english key , gamble away .
negative	it clearly doesnt happen to everyone but if it does happen , you can be assured the support staff will make no effort to fix your problems and always place the blame on you , the consumer .
negative	købte_en mini bærbar til_min kæreste i gave da hun var startet på århus uni ., og de mange håndskrevne - notater hang hende ud_af halsen .

negative	den præstation der blev fremvist her , følelsen af at man blev spist af med_en " den_er sendt " viser blot at wupti hverken kan , vil , orker eller dur til at servicere .
negative	kan_ikke handle_med sådan et firma igen , kan_ikke anbefale at der handles med_et sådan firma .
negative	er stærkt skuffet , dårligt behandlet og skræmt over manglende kompetance .
negative	as a friend you suck .
negative	my phone blew up with 00 messages , thanks alot .
negative	i have never dealt_with an online business that you can '_t talk to a real_person .
negative	i placed the order for my parts ten ... 00 .... ten days before they were even shipped .
negative	i could not get in touch with a human at partsgeek and the hold music is lousey too .
negative	when i received my order ( because of no customer_support ) i found i had not received all i needed to replace my valve_cover gasket .
negative	if i had talked to a real_person i would have known that i needed an addition seal for my plug tubes .
negative	good bye !
negative	good luck !
negative	and hope the best for your business closing day .
negative	box was in perfect_shape and the internal packaging was solid .

negative	bought a hitman absolution key from them .
negative	advertised that it would be available within 0 - 00_hrs after purchase .
negative	not the case , contacted support to cancel my order , i was told to wait and that it would be available the next_day in the morning , but again i told them that i did not want the key anymore .
negative	waited for a response , checked whether to see if they were in - stock , nope .
negative	again told them to cancel my order , and once again i was told to wait , really ?
negative	i wasn_'_t talking to a person , i was talking to a wall , and i wasn_'_t getting anywhere .
negative	i do not recommend cjs , probably the worst site to go to purchase cd - keys , support is horrible , and they don_'_t keep the promises they advertise .
negative	sad for such a " popular " cd_key site .

negative	let_me first say that i will remove or edit my post if i recieve the item i paid for .
negative	this whole thing was very difficult to deal with .
negative	i made an account here just to say so .
negative	people might have had good experinces , i did not .
negative	i have spent the past 0 days sending them pictures of my licence , my birth_certificate , and bills all to " verify who i was " although not before they charged me in full for the game !!
negative	they claimed that it was to prevent_fraud , even_though they didnt say anything about me having to jump threw all of these hoops before i bought the game .
negative	long_story short , 0 days ago i paid 00 $ for the game .
negative	i was charged for it , the money is gone , but i still have no game .
negative	i had to find a scanner to send some of these things .
negative	there are plenty of places you can go to to buy these games , do not go here unless you are okay with the idea of them saying they dont beleave who you are , altho i dont_know why that would matter after they take your money .
negative	i am a good person and if they actully give me the game i paid for i will come and edit my post , if they do not , i will tell my story on every game review site , company , that i can .
negative	every_single day .

negative	look at the first four words and ask do you really want to be one ?
negative	calculate how much it actually costs to sell on ebay .
negative	as a buyer it '_s great but as a seller forget it .
negative	it is cheaper to set fire to your money - even with the price of petrol these days .
negative	no seller protection either ebay assumes all sellers are evil filth with no honour or scruples let_alone honesty or reputation .
negative	for your own sake use gumtree , loot , your local paper , supermarket or corner shop .
negative	we seem to have forgotten these valid and cheap ways of selling your stuff that have been good for decades and still work .
negative	you don_'_t need to auction anything , be outbid at the last second or post your stuff , people collect it and pay you immediately usually in cash .
negative	boycott ebay and pay ( more ) pal remember they need you not the other way round .
negative	as part of ebay they have inherited the overcharging mentality of that company .
negative	there is no seller protection to speak of and as a seller you are penalised and viewed as guilty until proven innocent .
negative	there is no way i would use paypal if there was any other way , i would rather take a personal cheque and wait for it to be posted , walk to the bank in force 00 gales and rain then wait for it to clear than use pay ( more ) pal .

negative	i needed to change my flight as the original departure and return flights were changed by several hours .
negative	she called the airline , but since that line was busy , i was told travelocity would call me back within 00_hours .
negative	after a week , and no call , i called back .
negative	that rep was even harder to understand .
negative	i explained my situation , and he said , " there is no point in changing now , as there will be more changes and you should wait_until closer to your scheduled flight ."
negative	i still wanted to change as i knew it would be hard to get a seat so close to my scheduled flight , he would not let_me change .
negative	i called the airline_directly and changed it without a problem .
negative	the airline rep confirmed that if i would have waited , i would not have gotten a seat .
negative	i will never use travelocity again !

negative	good question !
negative	when we got there they charged me 00 . 00 more than i had already paid .

negative	i recieved a stone gasket_set .
negative	the part number is correct for my engine but the part maker is incorrect .
negative	ishino kits are priced higher_than stone .
negative	the stone kit that was shipped is priced a $_000 . 00 online with free shipping .
negative	partsgeek states they have the best price on parts .
negative	the ishino kit i ordered but did not receive is online price at $_000 . 00 with free shipping .
negative	i tried to contact partsgeek about this bait and switch with no success .
negative	i called with no answer and emailed with no response .
negative	hopefully my answers to this survey will hit home with thses folks and they will change their ways .
negative	i have contacted my credit_card compant to disputed their bait and switch process .
negative	i received a confirmation via_e_-_mail for a hotel_room at one rate and later found out the charged my credit_card another rate that is over $_000 higher .
negative	i could have booked direct with he hotel at a much_lower rate .
negative	when i e_- mailed their customer service , they responded with a statement that the higher rate was correct .
negative	i then sent them a copy of the confirmation i had received showing the lower rate and i get the same reply .
negative	i called the number they gave_me if i wanted to discuss it further and the service person had a hard time with english , could not answer any questions other than saying the higher rate is correct .
negative	she had no record of my e_-_mail with the attached copy of the confirmation i received and after switching me to a supervisor i was hung_up on .
negative	from reading other '_s opinions they seem to hang - up on people a lot .

negative	i cancelled my subscription .
negative	my wet food was fine , just the dry stuff had ants
negative	poor customer service if you ask me and i am out 00 bucks and my time to take a bunch of photos of the ants crawling around .
negative	she acted_like i was lying to her .
negative	i am unhappy .
negative	twice i '_ve ordered parts from the site on to have my orders canceled and my money refunded i '_ve also tried to call and the phone just rings and rings and rings i '_ve never been able to get through to a real_person
negative	i have yet to receive my order , maybe when i receive the package i can better
negative	give you an answere .
negative	paid for next_day delivery , recieved my item the day after , not happy at all !
negative	first i had asked them if it " physically " mattered whether the exhaust part i needed would mechanically fit my system if it were for ca emmissions or non ca emissions standards !
negative	since i didn_'_t live in ca , i wasn_'_t concernedi they said they " were not " interchangable and that i would need to re do the entire system if i went full non ca emissions standards .
negative	i then had asked them if they could verify with 000_% accuracy , the exhaust part that i needed and saw on their site , was correct for my car ..
negative	there were a few choices on their site for my year , make and model .
negative	they came back with their recommended " correct " part , based_upon my vin and mfg date that they had requested from me .
negative	i bought it and it was wrong !
negative	they now will not pay for the return shipping , or even acknowledge that " they " made the mistake , even_though they had told " me " that it was the correct part to order for my car , based_upon my vin and mfg date .
negative	ordered my glasses .
negative	after waiting a good 0 - 0_weeks i found they went back for some reason .
negative	you can bet my credit_card charge did not go back .
negative	so , i called and they said there must have been a mistake in delivery and i would have them in 0 - 00 days .
negative	that was over 0_weeks_ago .
negative	now it '_s time to call .
negative	good luck , all i got was you are caller # 0 or # 0 and the estimated time is 0 or 0 minutes .
negative	finally i get to the next caller and they send me to voice_mail in the middle of a business day .
negative	well , it '_s been over a half_hour now and i have been listening to the same 0 songs using up my minutes and expect to head off to voice_mail soon .
negative	my next call is to the credit_card company because this company is too inept to get it done .
negative	if you read the reply below you will notice they do not even know where the package is and told me i would have it in 0 - 00 days which has long passed .
negative	as far as a new shipping address goes , the last time i ordered they managed to get it to me .
negative	this time they sent it to 0 instead of 0 as the last digit of my address .
negative	not my mistake but now my problem .
negative	i like the comment , new shipping address offering themselves an out for their error and never mentioning they did not answer their phone after several phone_calls and about 00_minutes of being on hold .

negative	i installed the refurbished cartridges i purchased from ink_farm , and my printer still thinks they are empty .
negative	real nice !!
negative	!
negative	whilst the bouquet looked very nice on arrival .
negative	they did not last long at all .
negative	to be honest supermarket flowers are cheaper and last longer .
negative	will not be using again .
negative	tried to book a room in tracy for a 00 year class reunion .
negative	when it came time to pay , i was told that the room was booked and the hotel was full .
negative	so the transaction was not complete .
negative	so we booked thru someone_else .
negative	not only did easytobook . com charge my card for one night , they booked the room for totally the wrong night .
negative	i will never use this service again .
negative	it was their mistake to begin with , but won_'_t give us our money back .
negative	i order the book to find out 0 days_later by going into the account on the website that the order was cancel .
negative	no notification , no email , nothing .
negative	would never buy from this site
negative	can '_t get simple orders correct and sent the wrong parts .
negative	packages were poorly_packed and damaged .
negative	first time ever to use bookit . com
negative	upon making the reservation over the phone the agent advised that payment didnt go through , which caused me to leave where i was and drive home to get my other credit_card .
negative	after providing the second credit_card i was told everything_went through .
negative	i decided to call my credit_card company to see why it didnt go through and then was told the payment did go through !
negative	then i called my other credit_card company then realized another payment went through !
negative	that means i paid twice for this trip .
negative	i called the customer service and requested to speak to manager in regards to this issue , the agent told me this was an error on their end and the payment will eventually fall off .
negative	i still insisted to talk to the manager , the agent put me on hold for 00_mins then hung_up on me !
negative	this is the first time and last time i will ever use bookit .
negative	i used orbitz and expedia all my life and never had any_problems !!
negative	!
negative	trying to return a part but partsgeek has not sent me the needed rma_# as part of there red_tape a customer must have to make a return
negative	tried to reserve 0 rooms - agent took card no ., then said had only 0 - made reservation for 0 without authority then would not cancel .
negative	called cust .
negative	service who said could cancel - then put us on hold then call was dropped .
negative	they did not cancel .
negative	finally , after help from card , you gave coupons for only part of expense ---- very bad_experience !
negative	i ordered my parts it took to many days to get out .
negative	now ups is taking all the time as it should on how it was ordered .
negative	your shipping department should have noticed they took to long and upped the shipping type to 0nd or something quicker because of there mistake .
negative	i called your customer service and all they had to say is sorry and that is it and it took three_days to get that .
negative	i work on a time line i guess you dont .
negative	i paid an extra 00 $ for immediate delivery but it took a week and half until it arrived .
negative	i sashay three classes into semester when the book arrived .
negative	awful vacation due to book it errors . working people like me only vacation once a year because of finances . i chose bookit and my vacation was a disaster . upon_arrival the property_manager had to fix a rooming error bookit had made . then bookit charged my credit_card two times for my vacation package which put me in overdraft and had no funds to spend my entire vacation .
negative	so i did no sight_seeing no actives . awful 0000 vacation .
negative	never will use bookit or reccommend it again .
negative	i booked two flight tickets for the total price of 000 . 00 euros , no extra_charges .
negative	guess if i '_m surprised when i see my visa - bill .
negative	skytours billed 00 , 00 euros for issuing ticket and the tickets were charged 000_euros each !
negative	when i used their website to get an answer on the overcharging i recieved a polite answer that i will soon get a mail .
negative	well , after a weak i got a mail - " congratulations your ticket is ready and you can print it here .
negative	thank_you , we already made the trip ...
negative	i '_m sorry but i can '_t recommend skytours after this experience :(
negative	i ordered a part for my truck on friday , come monday i recieve an e_-_mail saying my card was declined when i go to the website you have a section specifically for those_who have their card declined !
negative	it '_s such a common occurance that you have a button on your page ?
negative	thought i would offer an caveat to any prospective clients who need a vehicle stored .
negative	my vehicle was broken into and approx .
negative	$_000 worth of items were stolen .
negative	public_storage offered no_recourse or restitution other that " we ' re sorry it happened ".
negative	they wouldn_'_t even give me some some free storage credit to help offset my losses .
negative	be warned !
negative	security for your vehicle is non_- existent .
negative	i was trying to book a hotel using the mobile_app because of the coupon expedia provided through their website , which was $_00 off any purchase over $_000 before taxes , exclusions apply ; my order came out to 000 or so before taxes and the days inn hotels were not excluded , therefore i was eligible .
negative	however when i entered the coupon_code it would not work so i called customer service and the first person i spoke to understood my situation as he even tried to use the coupon and it wasn_'_t working for him .
negative	i was told by him that i would have to make my purchase and then he would transfer me to another line where they would refund me the $_00 , deducting from my purchase ... and then provide me with a $_00 dollar coupon for the future , due to the inconvenience .
negative	once i was transferred i was told they could not do that , it is not their policy and that they could only provide me with expedia points , so i was transferred to the hotel management line where they were no help as well .
negative	i was told that they could not deduct the 00 from my order , as it was already purchased and that they could not provide me with a $_00 dollar coupon for the future so i spoke to a supervisor , after being on hold for 00_minutes , and when i explained my situation he refunded me $_00 from my purchase and ignored me when i told_him that i was also supposed to receive a $_00 dollar coupon for the future , his response was " have a good day "
negative	unprofessional , i was told 0 different policies , get your stories straight don_'_t tell someone false_information .
negative	really bad service , couldn_'_t get through to anyone via phone and the website suffers serious faults .. i . e signing in etc ... bad bad bad
negative	i have used p0g on more than one occasion but find the 0 day drop and collect service very poor they didnt even deliver it to my customer said he refused delivery when they didnt even arrive at his premises
negative	at present waiting for them to deliver back to myself i will not be using this service again
negative	several issues with regards to delivery of goods both on timed and untimed deliveries , not being kept_informed of items and poor pod when asked for via customer_services .
negative	i '_ve been ordering items from comms_express for years without issue but this experience has made me dubious_about ordering again .
negative	i rented curtains at the start of april , which were returned a week_later undamaged .
negative	they charged me nearly_£_000 for the hire , then when i called up to arrange delivery they charged me another £_00 to pick them up ( i ' d already paid for delivery ) and took a £_000 " deposit " on my card .
negative	it '_s now 00th_april and i '_ve just checked my account and they '_ve not refunded my £_000 !
negative	i just called their office to follow this up and it went through to answerphone saying the office was closed and that opening hours are 0 : 00 - 0 monday to friday .
negative	it '_s 00 : 00 on a wednesday !
negative	really not impressed , would not recommend using these_guys .
negative	no one told me i was booking with an agency .
negative	i thought i was speaking to super 0 reservations .
negative	when i checked in they said i booked with expedia .
negative	the first chick i talked to on the phone was trying to force into the reservation and the 0 and guy i spoke to couldn_'_t speak_english well .
negative	i gave two phone numbers and requested that i be contacted prior to delivery to facilitate entry to house .
negative	i was not contacted and the mattress was left with a neighbour which_meant that i had to arrange friends as lifters & carriers .
negative	no point in stipulating delivery arrangements if they are ignored .
negative	i '_m a repeat_customer , but wont be again .
negative	jeg_havde e_- cigaretterne i forvejen , men skulle bare have noget mere væske .
negative	bestilte 0 forskellige " tobaks " væsker med nikotin .

negative	utroligt kunstig smag , meget kemisk , meget parfume - agtig .
negative	lidt som når_man kommer_til at indånde ens deo .
negative	place a order and days latter got a e_-_mail saying merchandise was not available
negative	i don_'_t blame them if there is a problem with the department of state .
negative	but the least they can do is communicate .
negative	they don_'_t return calls or emails .
negative	i even emailed the owners just to find out what '_s going on , why haven_'_t i received my passport and they don_'_t respond .
negative	once they have your money they just don_'_t care if they deliver .
negative	they can '_t even return email much less be trusted to handle international paperwork .
negative	if you are looking for a ticket seller who :
negative	- lies to you about 00 times during a ticket sale ,
negative	- neglects your requests to refund you the money you rightfully own ,
negative	- and not be able to attend the event you bought tickets for on account of viagogo '_s terrible service ,
negative	then this is the place for you !
negative	i bought tickets for a michael buble concert that were posted on their website .
negative	when i received them they were the wrong tickets .
negative	after calling them back the day before the concert ( when i purchased the tickets ), they told me i would receive the correct ones via_email .
negative	well , that never happened .
negative	so , i called them back .
negative	after making 0 more false_promises to get back to me or email me different tickets , it was finally the day of the concert , just a few hours before it was supposed to start .
negative	they also said they ' d replace the tickets 0 times only to say 0 hours before the concert that they didn_'_t have any tickets to replace it , even_though plenty were still listed on the website .
negative	they then offered me 00_% of my money back and i could keep the tickets , but they were still the wrong ones , so i spoke with someone and i was told i would get a 000_% refund because i didn_'_t want the tickets .
negative	well , they processed the refund for only 00_% the next_day and " claimed i only said i wanted 00_% of the money back ".
negative	after the customer service rep rudely yelled at me and told me i was wrong and said i wanted 00_% refund and still keep the tickets ( which at this point was after the concert that i could no_longer go to , they told me they would listen to the call i had to verify that i said i didn_'_t want the tickets and i wanted all of my money back .
negative	again , they lied and never called me back .
negative	so after doing this for 00 days , someone was able to refund me the rest of my money .
negative	all i can say is that their unprofessionalism and incompetence is matched by no other and i would never recommend this website to anyone .
negative	we emailed the company after .
negative	a phone_call to peter regarding
negative	our dissatisfaction we received on the day on the 0th .
negative	may , on their service .
negative	to date we have not received a reply , apology .
negative	i think this demonstrates poor pr service ,
negative	bought a game card for riot .
negative	code was invalid and all ready claimed .
negative	still_haven_'_t refunded me .
negative	been 00_hours .
negative	haven_'_t even sent an_email_saying they seen my request and are processing it .
negative	but they sent an_email for me to review them .
negative	weird .
negative	i ordered a duvet_cover from bedek .
negative	i checked my e_mails and the order web_site every day for an intended delivery date .
negative	the order web_site showed that the order was being_processed and no notification of a delivery date ever came .
negative	it was sods law that on the one day that i went shopping , the delivery van called with my order .
negative	i had to contact their depot and reschedule the delivery .
negative	why could the delivery people not contact me the day before to ensure that i would be at home to receive the goods ?
negative	took over a week to even get the parts shipped .
negative	thats after i emailed and complained for 0 days .
negative	they have it set_up so you cant talk . to them on the phone .
negative	i even got told i could no_longer email them as they was blocking my address .
negative	i checked with the bbb and this company has an f for complaints .
negative	i believe its around 000 .
negative	never will i use this site again .
negative	the worst ever !
negative	hope the parts are not as bad .
negative	i ordered a self - tie bow_tie from my tuxedo and was delivered a pre_- tied bow_tie .
negative	i then phoned them and they apologised and promised the correct order would be delivered by saturday ( wedding day ) i am still_waiting for it !

negative	rubbish service
negative	prior to my recent june_0000 trip to nicaragua , i reserved a car for 00 : 00 on wednesday , june 00 , 0000 from rental_cars . com , an apparently british rental_car broker and affiliate with the priceline group .
negative	prior to contracting with them , i became concerned_about prior internet reports of the inflexibility of the company in dealing_with customer travel problems , so i called the company .
negative	after difficulty in reaching the company by phone ( their preference is by internet ), i spoke to an agent who assured me that the cancellation_policy was generous and flexible ; i remember his telling_me to call two_days prior to my pick - up date and the contract could be cancelled at no charge to me .
negative	on the day of my expected travel , my family and arrived at the airport only to find that my daughter '_s passport had expired .
negative	i then contacted the renting car agency budget on monday_morning , june 00 , 0000 .
negative	after a much confusing and prolonged conversation with budget '_s agent , i was directed to the booking agent , rental_cars . com .
negative	they offer only limited direct phone contact , if you have an issue after the initial booking .
negative	by the time i determined the proper means of contacting the company , it was around 00 : 00 ( according to their records ) that i cancelled my reservation .
negative	i alerted them i would not be able to pick_up the car , because of my daughter ’_s passport issues that disallowed her from leaving the country .
negative	through email correspondence , they said that i had not cancelled 00_hours prior to the time of pick - up , and even_though it was 00_hours to be exact , they were imposing a cancellation_fee equivalent to the costs of three - day rental charges , which in this case amounted to over one hundred_dollars .
negative	they directed me to their fine_print .
negative	even after explaining the circumstances , they were not willing to waive the fee .
negative	this company is obviously all about making money at the expense of the consumer and their business policies are conspicuously consumer unfriendly , inconsiderate , and rigid !!
negative	i contacted my credit_card company , who agreed that they found the charges to be excessive and exploitative .
negative	i strongly_suggest that you consider booking directly with the rental_car company or through another booking agent ( e . g_., expedia , kayak ) that do not require pre_- payment .
negative	best of luck , if you use them , especially if you have any travel difficulties .
negative	i say giftcards . com has slow shipping because i bought other goods within the same hour , being actually shipped to the same address .
negative	everything i bought , the furthest being in ny and i live in texas , got to the destination within 0 days .
negative	the dinky gift_card has still not arrived , and i payed more to " ship " it than one toy set from amazon .
negative	i have previously purchased sunglasses from your company on three occasions without too much_trouble .
negative	on the 00th_may 0000 , i ordered contact_lenses and the money was paid by credit_card .
negative	at the time of writing , i still had not received them .
negative	on a number of occaisions previously , i rang enquiries where i was variously informed that there were delays ( unspecified reasons ) but delivery was expected within a week .
negative	i received emails_telling_me that they were dispatched , but they were not .
negative	i suppose this is a lesson to me to trust my local_supplier , albeit at a cost , rather_than rely_upon an unreliable net provider .
negative	the most disappointing aspect of this is that vision_direct could not be honest with me regarding the delivery .
negative	i could not recommend this company to anyone .
negative	i was overcharged £_00 in august , informed that i would be refunded on my next bill , which i wasnt due to a technical " issue " which they refused to define .
negative	overall i must of wasted at_least 00_hours of my life dealing_with o0 .
negative	it is a releif to be free of them .
negative	they do not value their customers , they make promises which they do not keep .
negative	dont_bother signing_up to their service they will waste your time , and maybe steal your money .
negative	i bought a bushing_kit for a volvo i was working on .
negative	it comes in 0 pieces ; upper half , lower half and a bracket .
negative	the kit i received was missing the lower half of the bushing so it was useless and when i informed them of this error they required i send it back and once they receive it they would inspect it and determine how to handle the situation .
negative	considering i run a business and time is money , that wasn_'_t a good enough option .
negative	partsgeek has a bad return_policy and are careless upon inspect parts before shipping them .
negative	with that being said , i will never do_business with them again .
negative	we ordered a part which was allegedly supposed to be made for a 0000_mitsubishi mighty max 0x0 , 0 . 0l , v0 truck .
negative	the part they sent was completely wrong !
negative	so , we began the return process , sent back the part , only to be informed that it would cost us almost $_00 . 00 for them to re - tape the box and put it back on the shelf for a mistake that they made !
negative	after going through their ridiculous " support_ticket " routine several_times , their only form of customer contact ( i dare anyone to actually get through to them on the phone ,) we were told that our case was closed !
negative	they claim that they sent the part that we ordered , but if this is true ( which i doubt ) then their description of the product is wrong and it is still their fault .
negative	we have received no satisfaction from them whatsoever and have contacted the bbb .
negative	messed around two_days verifying payment ----
negative	got box and it was wrong part ----
negative	fit but wrong_size ---- mirror
negative	needed it ---- used - it ---- looks stupid ----
negative	no more purchases from these_people ----
negative	ordered brake_caliper brackets ... the right one wasn_'_t drilled correctly .
negative	i called and left a message asking someone to call me and no one did .
negative	finally had a friend re - drill the hole because i wasn_'_t willing to wait for shipping back and forth and i didn_'_t feel_like i should have to pay for shipping their defective_part .
negative	i strongly_suggest anyone considering using this company to go elsewhere unless you want junk parts and junk service .
negative	i spent almost $ 0 , 000 . 00 and was suppose to get everything that day .
negative	i was informed after i left that my coffee_table and end tables would be there the next_day , and they kept promising they would be in " next_day " for a week .
negative	instead of getting what i originally ordered i had to settle for something that was in stock so i knew i would have it that day .
negative	the manager has no customer service skills , and they informed me that if i wanted to wait on the coffee_table and end tables i wanted i would have to pay another $_00 . 00 delivery fee , when the company should have took the loss considering i was guaranteed all furniture the same day !
negative	not satisfied at all .
negative	my family nor myself will shop there again .
negative	i would rather pay full price and be treated right , than get the run around from american_freight .
negative	didn_'_t receive correct part and had to ship it back at my expense & charged a restocking on top of that , not too happy , could not get in touch with a person to talk to ' poor way to do_business
negative	i ordered from their website , paid via_paypal and there were no delivery details .
negative	company did not send me any delivery or tracking_information .
negative	the delivery company they used required a signature and tried to delver on two occasions a day apart then returned the package .
negative	i wax away for three_days and on my return found a not through my door asking me to contact them .
negative	i did so and found they had returned the package , from receiving it to sending back the delivery company had it about four days !
negative	on contacting gatemotors they insist pay again for the delivery and its my fault for not staying at home for the week !
negative	appalling service , only order from them guarantee there will always some one at home 00 / 0 to receive their package .
negative	if there is an issue do not expect any assistance from gatemotors .
negative	i didnt get the id i bought for runescape
negative	i ordered a christmas hamper for my parents in the uk specifying a christmas_eve delivery as a surprise .
negative	on december_00th i got a delivery confirmation from ihamper / iflorist .
negative	not wanting to spoil the surprise , i reached out to the company to confirm if it had been delivered or if this was a glitch and then i waited .
negative	and waited .
negative	and waited .
negative	after two additional emails and two phone_calls ( which go through to a line where there '_s no ability to leave a message and nobody ever answers ), i got an_email_stating that " your item was delivered early , on the 00th of december ."
negative	really ?
negative	i kind of figured that out already ... the question is why ?
negative	this is not a company i ' d recommend you do_business with .
negative	not only do they appear not to be able to deliver on time , but they don_'_t appear to care either .
negative	you can do better shopping elsewhere .
negative	paid for last_week promised phone_call for delivery on the 00th of october . if this is a sample of customer sevice you are rubbish .
negative	takes 0 - 0 days to get a response from customer service .
negative	i bought a tritton trigger xbox_000 headset .
negative	it was the last in stock and i was super excited to have grabbed it !
negative	when it arrived though it wasn_'_t sealed .
negative	i shrugged it off , maybe it got damaged in transport or something , but then when i open the box is stank of stale cigarettes .
negative	the wires were tangled , the codes inside were used , and the boxed was ripped and torn inside where someone had hastily stuffed it all back in before .
negative	the worst part ?
negative	after i plugged it in the damn headset didn_'_t even work .
negative	this was clearly returned previously and then just resold .
negative	i '_ve had issues with shopto before and this was the final straw .
negative	don_'_t do it .
negative	don_'_t be lured in with the allure of cheap prices .
negative	awful product , terrible service , and i would never buy from them again .
negative	ever .
negative	bought two cards .
negative	paid my money .
negative	taken from my account .
negative	but never received .
negative	after fighting for hours the game i tryed to put it on gave_me the promo that was being offerd of 0 dolar for the code that i payed 00 dolars for
negative	don_'_t rent_cars from rentalcars . com .
negative	a couple of weeks_ago i rented a car from them in chicago .
negative	i needed the car for less_than 00_hours and to drive only 00 miles .
negative	i had a paid in full voucher from rentalcars . com in hand .
negative	but when i went to check out the car , to my surprise they demanded that i pay for a full_tank of gas -- plus taxes .
negative	what i thought was going to be a $_00 rental ended_up being a $_000 bill .
negative	total_rip_off !
negative	i '_ll never rent from them again .
negative	it '_s cheaper to just call the car_rental company directly .
negative	that '_s what the clerk at the desk told me .
negative	that she has seen many angry customers like me who have rented from rental_cars . com .
negative	she said next time just call us directly .
negative	ordered with express delivery and still 0 business days_later car is no faster due to no air intakes received ,, helpppppppppppppppppppp ,,,
negative	i ordered 0 items from the same warehouse .
negative	they shipped in three_separate_shipments .
negative	the last box , with 0 items isn_'_t due to arrive for another few_days .
negative	the radiator i ordered was dropped_off by fedex without a signature , and yes , it was damaged .
negative	what was parts_geek response , ship it back to us , order a new one and wait .
negative	well , it cost me $_00 bucks to ship it back , and there was no way i was going to chance another radiator that parts_geek would not stand_behind .
negative	now i wait to see if i get my purchase price back , which they say will take 00 days .
negative	i am very displeased with how parts_geek does business !!!
negative	!
negative	efter_en_del rykkere tog det seuf 00 dage at konkludere at varen_var udsolgt .
negative	man_kan dog stadig bestille præcist denne vare på_hjemmesiden .
negative	er_det udelukkende for at lokke kunder til ?
negative	the parts i ordered arrived , but not as_described .
negative	i called 0 times , holding for 00_minutes the first five times and gave up , then a half an_hour the last time , with their phone just eventually hanging up on me .
negative	i used their email " customer service " which provides service in name only .
negative	after numerous_attempts to get them to do what was right , they finally flat out told me they wouldn_'_t fix my problem .
negative	do not buy from parts_geek .
negative	har flere_gange fået slettet profil der blevet betalt for , og_hvis_man skriver til boyfriend . dk får_man intet_svar tilbage , hvad årsagen skyltes .

negative	thy will remove any bad feedback you leave for a buyer .
negative	i see from other_reviewers that they do the same .
negative	so you really can '_t trust their review system - it '_s rigged .
negative	the fee is high if you only earn $_000 or less ( 00 %).
negative	but it drops if you earn more .
negative	as such , it can be the lowest of o ' desk / freelances at 00 %, elance at 0 . 00 %, guru at 0 . 0 - 0 . 0 %.
negative	at he $ 0 , 000 level you start to approach 0 . 0 % - which is really low as a freelancer .
negative	i ordered a pair 000_dollars glasses , got prescribed lenses , and ask for the over night shipping , but when i got my glasses , i did not get my prescribed lenses , and i was charged $_000 . 00 .
negative	can you see the problem here ?
negative	i would not recommend this website
negative	initially told 0 - 0 days delivery over the phone before placing order .
negative	0 days_later i receive a text_message informing_me of a 0 hour_window the following_day ....
negative	the day arrives and the courier try '_s to deliver to the billing_address rather_than the delivery address .
negative	two phone_calls later i '_m informed it still can '_t be delivered and i will personally receive a call from the courier ..
negative	no call received ..!.
negative	eventually contacted to say expected re - delivery in a further 0 days ..
negative	i ' m00 days in and still no delivery and £_000 down
negative	first and last time for me with tennis_nuts . com
negative	read the small_print carefully .
negative	i typically love youtube , but i '_m really not happy about seeing a commercial when i just want to watch a short video !
negative	come on guys , enough is enough .
negative	i was very disappointed that when i had a problem there is no one to discuss it with .
negative	filling_out a " comment card " and then waiting 0 days to hear back is not good business .
negative	on top of that , you give an answer that was the just of my concern to begin with .
negative	never again .
negative	( i still_haven_'_t rec ' d the driver - side turn_signal lens i ordered for my 00 passat !!!)
negative	i order parts , they sent me the wrong parts and want me to pay to ship them back .
negative	i went to ship them back and the ship cost as much as i paid for for the parts .
negative	partsgeek kept me on hold on the phone for over an_hour and still would not resolve the issue with me .... my advice do not do_business with them ....
negative	fedex was to ship my package on the 0 / 0 / 00 but they forgot to put it on the truck now it '_s going to be on the 0 / 0 / 00 bet i want get it thin should have used ups fedex is a poor_excuse of delivery servece i have ever_seen i give them a o no wounder everyone uses ups fedex i no i get what i paid for sloppy service
negative	seemed like the most fair priced facility but very hard to make actual contact with a human_being therefore we did not rent a storage_unit from here . we needed something right_away which i was able to confirm and reserve online very easily . but we were unable to talk with someone and physically see the unit before_committing to a storage_unit .
negative	extremely dis - satisfied with how the business is run .
negative	they are very cheap and i guess you get what you pay for .
negative	i ordered a game on monday with their word that i would get the key " instantly " or " 0 hours " with paypal .
negative	first i needed to pass their weird anti_- fraud system which i can understand_why they do it .
negative	the problem is , they say it takes 0 hours .
negative	i had to wait 00 + hours .
negative	great , now i can get the game right ?
negative	nope , apparently they ' re out of keys , and new ones will be arriving within the next 00_hours !
negative	now here i am 00 ( yes 00 ) hours_later with no key , no replies from their support no nothng , nothing but lies .
negative	iam waiting to hear from parts_geek for over a week , can someone call or help 000 000 0000
negative	bob
negative	every other online store does full refunds and order cancellation .
negative	why not this one ?
negative	i put an order through online .
negative	i was ordering some parts for my sons car for christmas and he was really excited to have them coming .
negative	a week_later i had heard_nothing from parts_geek so i took the initiative to email them myself .
negative	the response i received said that because i was canadian , they could not process my credit_card therefore they cancelled the order .
negative	no parts for christmas !
negative	no concern on their part !
negative	i had to buy from someone_else .
negative	good business_practice .
negative	0 words you suck
negative	they have a promotion to call to cuba in which they double the minutes when making a deposit , in this case i deposit for $_00 and suposed to receive 00_minutes , but i was calling to cuba and conection is harder than calling to any other place .
negative	after few attempts my call finally when thru , but i noticed the time remaning was shorter and when checking the calls time i saw they count the unsuccessful intents a part of the time within the promotion , not just that but if your firsts call fail and it last for 0 : 00 that counts for 0 : 00_minutes , because this is the way they do it according to a representative called fernando who took_care of my complaint .
negative	in resume be aware that you will not enjoy the full minutes indicated as they say .
negative	i have recently ordered a brake_master_cylinder for my 0000_vw rabbit pickup , the first time i ordered it with a bunch of other stuff and when i got the parts the master_cylinder was the wrong part i ordered the none with 0 outlets and i relieved the one with 0 outlets .
negative	after emailing them 0 times with nothing but a default response with absolutely no help i had to just order the part over again and pay the shipping cost again and also pay to return the wrong part .
negative	so i ordered the new brake cylinder , when i received it again it was the wrong part again and now here i am in the same place i started having to pay shipping for yet another master_cylinder and i have to pay to ship the wrong one back again .... poor customer service even after i have spent over 000 $ in the last 0 months
negative	unfortunately , the recipient was not at home ( not the fault of the florist ).
negative	the florist phoned twice that day .
negative	that was all .
negative	after 0 days we discovered that the flowers had not been delivered by examining phone records .
negative	after_contacting the florist on day 0 , the flowers were delivered the next_day , so_far after the event as to make it meaningless .
negative	the flowers looked nothing like the picture we ordered from ( photos available ) and were of doubtful quality with a large curly length of wire sticking out of the display .
negative	we were book in to monter carlos hotel at las_vegas - travelocity says we have a 0 free tickets of the show but when we book in the hotel thay says travelocity have canceled the tickets ....
negative	please do not book trought travelocity ...
negative	paid for a holiday apartment on e_bay and paid via_paypal .
negative	it turned_out to be a scam , thinking i was protected with paypal i informed them only to be told i was not covered as it was over 00 days , so i lost 000_pounds paypal could not care less so beware !!
negative	!
negative	i ordered a radiator and you guys didn_'_t give me a choice to ship 0nd day .
negative	it '_s been over a week and fedex_ground still has not delived it and its sitting on their truck .
negative	i think next time i '_m ordering somewhere_else
negative	( keep reading ) supplementwarehouse . com is the only place i go to pick_up my supplements , unless i need something right_away and can '_t wait .
negative	other than that i only order from supplement_warehouse .
negative	their price_matching is excellent !
negative	their inventory is incredible .
negative	( original )
negative	you know what scratch that ..... they are fucking dicks .. their price_matching sucks now ....... fuck them !
negative	i '_ll just go to gnc or vitamin_shoppe now .
negative	( follow_up )
negative	they sent the wrong part .
negative	now they want me to pay for the return postage ?
negative	who does that ?
negative	for a second time i received wrong_size of ordered shoes .
negative	next time i will do shopping in local store .
negative	not recommended .
negative	can i have free pizza ?
negative	about 0_weeks_ago i ordered 0 parts for my 0000_kia sportage .
negative	i have received only 0 part .
negative	i am still_waiting for my fan . i have not received a not available or back order notice .
negative	although i have gotten several offers for coupons . but if i have to give you my e_mail address for a coupon i do not it .
negative	i still want the fan
negative	i ordered floor_mats for a 0000_audi tt .
negative	they didn_'_t fit .
negative	it automatically cancelles when you try to add a second room .
negative	very complicated .
negative	not user_friendly .
negative	i just received my i placed back on 0 - 00 - 0000 a week would have been expectable sent you a few emails with no response ups would not give me a eta until friday in the mean time found another suppler picked_up materials for job needing last_week reason for order on the 0 - 00 - 00 maybe i should have given a month for delivery or maybe a response from my emails would have been nice
negative	when i ordered my address was correct but product was sent to wrong_address .
negative	when i tried to contact you there was never an answer .
negative	you wait 00 min and your phone auto hangs_up ?
negative	do you have customer service person to person ?
negative	you can take my money but can '_t answer where my product is ?
negative	first off they changed the delivery date which was fine then they didn_'_t deliver on the date they changed too then the next_day they said it would come today which it never so phoned them ( which was impossible because it kept going onto answering_machine 00 times ) finally got someone and they said sorry it won_'_t be till monday now ?!
negative	why didn_'_t anyone tell me this or at_least said in the morning so i didn_'_t have to miss another day at work so it '_s resulted now in 0 days of work lost which adds up to more than the value of the bed so fingers_crossed it will come on monday now - but i will never again be buying from this joke of a company
negative	ill never use this site again .
negative	these_jokers sent me parts the were snapped in half .
negative	how do they expect a consumer to accept parts that are in worse condition then the ones you ' re trying to replace ?
negative	if you ' re thinking about purchasing parts from this website , turn back now !
negative	waste of time .
negative	we reserved online for 0 units 0x00 at $_00 . 00 per unit .
negative	we drive up and are greeted_by a lady that asked us " why are you here "?
negative	i respond - excuse me but this is conyers storage ?
negative	( the only_thing in sight ) she replies yes and then pause as if see did not want to open the door .
negative	we are then greeted_by her grand_daughter ( smiling ) - says hello and do we have a reservation ?
negative	i state yes here it is own my phone -- meanwhile 0 dogs are in the lobby area eating and paperwork everywhere .
negative	they showed us a unit that had - half of a car in it !
negative	i did not take the unit .
negative	we choose public_storage .
negative	very unprofessional - do not use this company
negative	ordered online , chased 0 days_later and was promised it was coming .
negative	chased again promised next_day delivery .
negative	wrong item arrived 0 days_later , returned for refund but didn_'_t get the £ 0 . 00 return postage refunded !
negative	wouldn_'_t recommend or use again
negative	i returned a ac core and never received my core money back . cost me $_00 . 00 to return it .
negative	no voice contact .
negative	you shipped me a broken part .
negative	its been 0_weeks and i cannot send back because you have not sent me an_rma_number .
negative	some retard replied in an_email " we will arange pickup ".
negative	wtf ??????????
negative	unable to resolve as yet because there is no way to speek to a person
negative	i paid for overnight service of a new passport on weds 0 / 0 .
negative	i prepared and sent them all of the appropriate documents and they had my travel date of 0 / 00 .
negative	they guaranteed delivery by friday 0 / 0 .
negative	they issued me a tracking_number on 0 / 0 but fed_ex never received the package that was supposedly sent .
negative	i have been calling all day and there is nobody at the office .
negative	i am not sure if my information has_been stolen or if this company is just negligent .
negative	either way this service should never be used by anyone , ever .
negative	there are many alternatives that provide the same service .
negative	i will now miss my flight which i am certain they will not reimburse me for , and likely have to take actions to recover the funds they have charged me for a service that was not provided .
negative	got the key within an_hour ... was a steam product key for cod_: mw0 ... was excited at the price ... and the fact i '_ve bought from them in the past .... but , this time , was freaking awful .
negative	they sent me a duplicate key ... meaning they already sold someone the key i received ...
negative	highly pissed .. and have been waiting for a response from them , but nothing .
negative	i am a civil lawyer .
negative	hope you respond soon .
negative	they added this 0 hours ago :
negative	instead of attacking us , might be a good idea to have a little patience and wait for us to resolve the issue .
negative	thanks for being so understanding and complaining_about us to the whole world .
negative	next time , take your business elsewhere if you think we are such a terrible company .
negative	//////
negative	here '_s my response :
negative	sorry , i thought you , propitiatory company of cd_keys , would take things a little more serious .
negative	you have 00 more hours to refund me or replace the product key i purchased .
negative	i sincerely hope you haste this process ..
negative	resolving this issue is a no_brainer .
negative	refund the money , or give me a new product key ....
negative	it doesn_'_t take 00_hours .
negative	it '_s common_sense .
negative	btw , i am a lawyer .
negative	last time i checked , selling " sold " goods to another customer is illegal .
negative	you might want to be a little more careful in the future .
negative	* update *
negative	yeah , what you guys don_'_t realize is that when you sell duplicate keys ... whomever is trying to register the same product key jeopardizes the original buyer of that same key ... so in essence , you aren_'_t just screwing the guy you sold the original key to but also the guy you just screwed .
negative	you really aren_'_t in any place or circumstance to be making smart ass comments on an open discussion about your company .
negative	btw , posting complaints privately made to your website from a customer is very unprofessional .... might want to look up nicola brookes vs internet trolls of facebook ( it was a very popular case ).
negative	say anything negative or slanderer , further , and i '_ll sue you .
negative	* update *
negative	actually the fb troll case has everything to do with what i '_m saying .
negative	you are continually harassing me based on an honest review ; taking classless but legal legalities is just_plain dumb .
negative	i '_m not an_idiot , i realized from the start about your non_- disclosure .
negative	i am just here to inform your future buyers of your unprofessional - ism and irresponsibility to current and future clients .
negative	i '_m almost 000_% positive that the natural reaction of someone buying previously sold goods is irritability .
negative	i gave you a fair warning , be expecting a subpoena .
negative	p . s .
negative	i got everything i need in this review .
negative	regular customer , last_year most orders showed_up within 00_hours .
negative	been over a week now and you '_ve sent me an_email looking for me to rate the service without having gotten my order to me .
negative	i always recommended usn ireland to my friends mainly_because of their great service , will have to rethink it in the future .
negative	hope this is a once off , products themselves are great .
negative	i was shipped the wrong hitch .
negative	when i called american_rv , the customer service representative was not helpful .
negative	his demeanor was that i did not know what i was doing .
negative	he did not ask questions to figure_out 0 ) that there was indeed a mis_- shipment , or 0 ) how to solve the problem .
negative	assuming i was totally clueless about how to install a hitch , he told me i needed technical_assistance , and that i ' d need to call the manufacturer for that .
negative	i called the manufacturer ( curt ) and received great service and support .
negative	american_rv added nothing to the transaction and is doing a disservice to curt , if it is their intent to be a value - added reseller .
negative	curt seems more able to service the retail side of things and should consider selling direct .
negative	the entire experience with big_bus was disappointing .
negative	we bought our tickets online and went to the information center as directed to pick_up the tickets .
negative	we were told to turn left out of the office and head down the street one block to the stop on the corner and wait for the next bus .
negative	we were also told that a big_bus attendant would be there at the stop .
negative	we got to the stop and there was no attendant .
negative	we waited at this stop for more than 00_minutes before a bus arrived , although the advertised times were 00 - 00 .
negative	the bus that arrived was completely full inclusive of the aisles .
negative	understandably , the driver would not let any additional passengers on board .
negative	by this time as we were waiting we counted at_least 0 of the original bus_tour_bus '_s pass by our location .
negative	tired of waiting and not wanting to wait another 00_minutes for the big bust to come by again we went back to the information center to seek a refund on our tickets and stated that we were disappointed with our experience and inability to join a tour .
negative	at the information center they stated they were unable to provide a refund .
negative	very poor customer service all around .
negative	the part they sent was different than the original and also looked reconditioned .
negative	i have to pay for return shipping .
negative	i ordered online and the bill was charged instantly to my credit_card .
negative	it was over a month before any goods arrived .
negative	when i rang they were unable to find my records .
negative	i had to return one of the items about a month_ago and i have still not had a refund ; on checking , they have no record of it being returned despite the fact that the delivery service confirm it was signed for .
negative	to wmonths down the line and i am still owed money .
negative	i would never do_business with this company again .
negative	i ordered 0 chrome mirrors for my truck and got one chrome and one black vinyl .
negative	i tried_calling customer service but not surprisingly there '_s no customer service , just an_automated answering system directing you to the website so i sent an_email request for a return ticket or number but not surprisingly haven_'_t heard back yet , it '_s been almost a week not .
negative	i '_ve also read_reviews online about parts_geek and they are to say the least " shocking "
negative	seems like plenty of customers are and have experienced the same problems having .
negative	don_'_t buy from parts_geek
negative	should be called " parts jerk "
negative	go somewhere_else .
negative	stay_away from partsgeek .
negative	man , it '_s been 00 days and nothing !!
negative	they e_- mailed me and said it would be no later than the 00th .
negative	and here i am on the 00th and still nothing ...
negative	my last four orders didn_'_t arrive to me .
negative	all my emails to returns @ suppz . com received no response from suppz personnel despite the orders were returned to us .
negative	it seems the first three orders had the wrong_address and was no delivered because of that , then being returned to us .
negative	i will never buy from suppz again .
negative	i customer would forgive almost anything but indifference .
negative	i ordered an a /_c compressor from them 0_weeks_ago and still no part unless the part comes in on a horse and buggy that is unexeptible
negative	ordered a set of 0 injectors , they only sent one , claiming they were not selling six injectors , rather one for the price of six .
negative	a set of six injectors for a 00 mustang would cost roughly_$_000 , the highest price found anywhere .
negative	i '_ve tried to explain that a set of six injectors brand_new would be about a third the cost .
negative	they are advertising six injectors for a given price , but you will only get one .
negative	i '_ve since had to , them to the bbb and do a charge back on my cc .
negative	will never do_business with them again , and will tell_everyone i know how they screwed me , costing me money for not getting the car to the show in running condition .
negative	this shit has_been going on for almost a month !
negative	never do_business with these pukes , they are not a parts store , just a con .
negative	why have not been honest and disclose that british_airways sells baggage allowance for the same amount ?
negative	are you happy to all by stealth at a higher price ?
negative	who is the marketing genius behind this heist ?
negative	the part advertised did not fit my vehicle .
negative	now my car is taken apart and i can '_t wait another week for the part to come .
negative	very , very disappointing .
negative	i bought strut assy for both_sides of a 0000_malibu and i got two of the drivers_side .. each box labeled correct for each side but i got two drives side struts .
negative	i had to re buy the part and pay the return shipping .
negative	be my guest at getting a live_person on the phone for returns at parts_geek .
negative	i received my parts and started to install the but when i when to install the new motor_mounts , one was wrong , the parts was in the right box but the part was wrong .
negative	i spent hours running around looking for the replacement locally because i had the engine jacked already , this ended_up costing me tons of time and money .
negative	not happy at all !
negative	this company keeps leaving parcels outside despite the note on the door asking couriers to leave parcels with the neighbours when we are out and explicitly stating " yodel - do not leave parcels outside !".
negative	i have highlighted " yodel " with a red marker and only a blind person would miss it .
negative	still , they keep ditching parcels in the driveway , by the door , behind the bin , under the car , etc .
negative	all other couriers either leave parcels with the neighbours as per my note , or leave a card .
negative	yodel never do .
negative	yesterday for the umpteenth time they left a parcel outside in the rain , while it was raining , and of course it got completely soaked .
negative	it contained electronic_equipment ; i have not yet had time to test whether it works or not .
negative	a year_ago they failed to delivery my mother '_s christmas_present , but said they would deliver it for new year .
negative	they did not .
negative	i obtained a refund from the vendor , but my mother remained without a present .
negative	on other occasions yodel left a card " sorry you were out " and the parcel in front of the door in plain view from the street , although we were in fact at home and the lights were on .
negative	they just did not bother ringing the doorbell .
negative	this included apparent temp workers with their own cars who were always in a hurry to dump the parcel and leave .
negative	once yodel managed to hit a parcel so badly that they cracked the screen of the item inside despite the abundant foam padding .
negative	it took me almost a month to return the damaged item and receive a replacement from the german vendor .
negative	i have complained to <_external link_removed_> uk three_times about yodel '_s delivery service of " prime " orders .
negative	every time <_external link_removed_> politely replied that they took such complains very seriously and would look into the matter .
negative	however , yodel continued leaving <_external link_removed_> orders outside , so i was forced to cancel my " prime " subscription .
negative	i also avoid ordering from online_retailers who deliver with yodel .
negative	i suppose yodel '_s business model is to do a maximum number of deliveries in minimum time without returning items to the depot , thus keeping costs low and offering competitive prices to business customers .
negative	i see no other reason_why big retailers like <_external link_removed >, etc .
negative	would still use yodel apart_from cost savings that outweigh the horrible quality of service .
negative	it must be more economical to compensate customers for damaged or lost orders rather_than to do the job properly !
negative	at the same time it is putting unfair pressure on <_external link_removed_> and courier companies that take the time to actually do their job .
negative	yodel '_s is a despicable service that has no place in the uk in the 00st_century .
negative	it has to reform , or die .
negative	i did not like the product i bought and emailed festive_lights .
negative	no response .
negative	i emailed them again .
negative	then again .
negative	nothing .
negative	this is not the way to treat a customer .
negative	their website clearly_indicated a part would fit my application .
negative	i received that part and it was not close .
negative	numerous_emails , that spoke in a geekspeak language later , i have to pay postage both directions for the wrong part .
negative	the problem is in the listing and i expect there a lot more , based on other partsgeek complaints .
negative	we rented a car through travelocity .
negative	the car company was payless .
negative	when we went to pick_up our car , they wanted to charge us a $ 0 , 000 security deposit which they said they would refund in 00 days !
negative	so we cancelled our reservation and had to take a cab to our destination , which cost $_000 each way .
negative	very disappointed that travelocity would use payless as a rental_car vendor .
negative	if your parcel is dispatched and you don_'_t receive it , the onus is on you to try and track it down .
negative	if you want a refund you have to wait at_least 00 " working days " before you can try to claim it back .
negative	would have given no stars if i could , total scam .
negative	you sent me the wrong part and then it cost me $_00 to ups it back to you .
negative	no more future business from me .
negative	i placed a order which they took 0 days to dispatch although it was placed well before 0pm on a tuesday .
negative	the websites promised next_day dispatch where it was actually dispatched 0 days_later which happened to the friday .
negative	i had paid for next_day delivery and arranged for someone to be in the house .
negative	the delivery company only does next_day monn - fri and any orders recieved to them on friday are sent monday .
negative	well it happened to be bank_holiday monday and the delivery team showed_up on tuesday when no one was at home .
negative	now because i can '_t have anyone to sign for it mon - fri this week i either have to pay £_00 extra for saturday delivery or collect from the depo 00 miles_away , bare in mind i already paid £ 0 for nedt day delivery .
negative	betime i get my order it will of taken 00 days .
negative	i contacted mp 0 days ago still had no reply .
negative	the new call of duty black_ops_0 ( hardened edition ) arrived as expected .
negative	on opening the parcel however the game box was not covered in cellophane and more_importantly there was no game in the box .
negative	i now have to return this in my own time at the local post_office and wait for a refund as they have already sold out of replacements .
negative	i am now temporarily_out of pocket as i have purchased the game elsewhere .
negative	i will not use this company again !
negative	your kidding .
negative	you sent me the wrong part . you want me to pay freight to sent it back . if you try to call to talk to a person good luck .
negative	not happy . wish i would of read the blogs about our company before i placed my order . i can '_t believe your still in business .
negative	they changed my resavations more than once and i could not get any one to talk to kept getting .
negative	e_mails even after the changes were made took 00 days to get it done and times were not to my liking
negative	hello ,
negative	the booking part of the experience was fine .
negative	however , i asked specificly for a quiet room when i called sat .
negative	morning ..
negative	and ended_up with a huge party below me somewhere , and more loud party goers till 0 : 00 am ....
negative	if you ask me , i shouldn_'_t have to pay for the room at all !
negative	i almost never do these reviews , but i feel strongly that i was mistreated by framesdirect and i want others to know about it .
negative	when i opened the package and the case for the prescription_glasses , these were my immediate observations :
negative	0 .
negative	the right rubber earpiece was barely attached to the temple .
negative	it looked like the glue that was supposed to be keeping it in place had either worn off or was not applied correctly .
negative	i tried on the glasses anyway and the rubber fell_off completely on the first wear .
negative	( maybe not framesdirect '_s fault , but a quick inspection should '_ve caught this .)
negative	0 .
negative	the right temple was very loose , to the point that it twists severely and barely stays in place .
negative	0 .
negative	the left temple , however , was so tight that the spring did not activate ; when i try to open the left temple , it flexes the glasses in the bridge area .
negative	the combination of the loose right temple and tight left temple forces the glasses to sit crooked on my face .
negative	i acknowledge that in order to get a proper fit , i would need to take them to an optician to fine_tune the shape of the temples .
negative	but i find it unacceptable that the glasses i received are entirely unwearable in their arrived condition .
negative	it appeared that no one even tested the foldable temples .
negative	it is a glaring error that should have been checked prior to shipping .
negative	first , i emailed the customer service explaining exactly_what i wrote above .
negative	two_days went by without a response .
negative	so i called the framesdirect number , got through the phone tree to the customer service line , stayed on hold for 00 - 00_mins , then got pushed to a woman '_s voicemail .
negative	i left a message .
negative	i heard_nothing the next_day so i called back .
negative	same phone tree , same hold time , same woman '_s voicemail .
negative	i did this not twice , but five times !
negative	no response from any of the voicemails or original email !
negative	so i called back and got through to a salesperson on the phone tree ( the salespeople pick_up right_away , big surprise !).
negative	she was unhelpful and unapologetic but finally relented in letting_me return them for a refund after " talking to a manager ."
negative	please follow my advice , stay_away from these_guys .
negative	i instead went to an optical attached to my ophthalmologist '_s office and got the exact_same pair but without the issues above , fitted on the spot , and for $_00 less_than framesdirect .
negative	the horrible service you get from these_guys is not worth the money you might save up front .
negative	product was not in english_language .
negative	when unpacked from the post wrapping it smelt of stale cigarettes .
negative	i '_m a big_fan of internet shopping , but this was probably the worst experience i have had .
negative	tried to raise this with their customer service team , but it is a computer message - board , and they were really not interested at all .
negative	shocking really .
negative	this is my first experience with dhl and i sincerely hope it to be my last ... i bought from china some stuff to be send in ireland .. my delivery was late because it was at clearance event for some time .. i call them and i spent 00e because they given mi other numbers to call . i ask why staying so long ..
negative	your shipment was stopped by customs for exam .
negative	they have now requested to see proof of purchase and will accept , paypal , western_union receipt or debit / credit_card statement .
negative	i send the paper to them to see that i pay everyting .. after 0 days they send mi a sms with the some requirements .. so i send again and again .. after that they send me a mes .. dear costumer you must to pay costoms import taxes of 00 . 00e to receiv the shipment .. i call them again what '_s the alternative because i dont want to give them my bank details by phone and they say to give the mony to the driver but i will not receiv a receiver .. ok no problem .. and so now waiting for my package after long time .. the value of the pack is 00e and the dhl tax and shipment is 00 . 00e the box has 0killo .. and the time 0 to 0 days .. nothing was ok .. i hopp i will have my pack .. no received information when they wiil come .. cheers and no recommend dhl
negative	i am writing as a customer that will never do_business with this company ever again .
negative	i have been very patient throughout this whole_process , but this is just getting ridiculous !
negative	my order was first placed on may 00 , 0000 and received my glasses about six_weeks_later at the end of june with the wrong prescription .
negative	i then sent my glasses back for a correction and was promised from karen , that they would correct it and send it back with overnight shipping .
negative	the corrected glasses was sent out on june 00 , 0000 .
negative	today , is july 00 , 0000 and i still have yet to received them .
negative	i had purchased these glasses because i had broken my old_ones .
negative	it has_been over two months and i '_ve been forced to wear contacts everyday since .
negative	buyers_beware !
negative	if you need your eyewear sent to you correct and in a timely_manner , do not buy from frames_direct !
negative	completely_unacceptable !
negative	order 000000
negative	this my third time i have written to you , to tell that you that you send me the wrong prescription_glasses .
negative	i have yet to recieve a logical answer .
negative	please_let_me know i can do ?
negative	i was extremely disappointed about 0 things .
negative	first of all the price quoted was 00_% more after we
negative	were done booking the hotel_room ( because there was a $_00 resort_fee and parking fee
negative	that we weren_'_t told about ).
negative	also when we tried to call your customer service , the tape said we have
negative	to pay $_00 to talk to someone !!!!!
negative	and it said we have to wait 00 min .
negative	for someone in customer service
negative	to pick_up the phone !!!!!!!!!!
negative	tried to cancel after 0 min of booking , it said we have to pay $_00 penalty .
negative	we don_'_t know what kind of operation you are running !!!!!!!!
negative	not fair to your customers .
negative	i have sent you a request for rma and i still do not have it and they said i would get a phone_call and not even that and you don_'_t take phone_calls so how do you do this to your customers .
negative	thanks robert johnson

negative	no cumplen los plazos de_entrega y_el asistente ademas de desconocer el idioma español es tremendamente mal educado
negative	i was anxiously waiting for my book and it was never delivered .
negative	for public speaking class .
negative	this place is terrible .
negative	the worst online_retailer i have seen .
negative	they sell items on the website which are out - of - stock , knowing it will take weeks to replenish .
negative	their refund process takes 0_weeks .
negative	of course , they withdraw the payment within 0 seconds of you placing the order ... but getting that money back is like pulling_teeth .
negative	be prepared to wait on hold for 00_minutes each time you call , before they tell you the items will restock " tomorrow ."
negative	" tomorrow ."
negative	" tomorrow ."
negative	i would go_anywhere_else but here .
negative	a completely unprofessional and unorganized business .
negative	i order a rim to replace a bent one on my car .
negative	the first rim showed_up with a broken lip and paint chips and flaking off .
negative	i had to return the 0st rim and since they don_'_t have an exchange program you have to order another product and return the broken one and carry two charges until they refund you .
negative	i ordered a 0nd rim while my 0st rim was being shipped back to them .
negative	i recieved the 0nd rim , it was also chipped on the lip ( this time it was barely good enough to hold air ) and the color doesn_'_t match as the ads say .
negative	do not order products from this company , also they don_'_t have a phone_number to talk to anyone you have to send emails and wait 00_hours for a response .
negative	i used partsgeek for the first time to get a repair part for my car .
negative	unfortunately i bought the part without_realizing that the search_engine to differentiate the specific model of car was not adequate to identify the correct part for my car .
negative	partsgeek '_s website sold me the incorrect part .
negative	although the part arrived quickly it was the wrong one and when i phoned to try and get the correct part the guy i talked with just pointed_out that i had bought the incorrect part , and couldn_'_t care less that it was due to a defect in their website .
negative	partsgeek would not give me a return shipping_label .
negative	the flippant manner i was dealt_with convinced me i will not be a future partsgeek customer .
negative	this was the worse experience i have ever had .
negative	we were lied to over and over again .
negative	the car was horrible .
negative	such a disappointment .
negative	i will never be back !!
negative	!
negative	over a week after_placing my order , i still have not received it !
negative	!
negative	their latest trick for not honoring price matches is to say the competitor charges excessive shipping fees .
negative	also , beware that the freebies they claim to be free increase your ' shipping ' charges by about a dollar per freebie .
negative	iwant to speak to same from your company to explain what happen i prefer to speak in spanish
negative	im trying to contact them so i can return an item but you cant get an actual_human_being .
negative	just an_automated piece of junk .
negative	and it keeps telling you to use there support_ticket .
negative	when the damn support_ticket has_been down for a month .
negative	how am i suppose to return an item and get my money back when you get even get a person to talk to ?
negative	i will never ever use this company ever again .
negative	i bought two business class tickets from stockholm to vancover ( round_trip ) from bravofly . com and paid over 0000 euro extra for business class vs economy .
negative	after charging me close to 0000 euros , they ring me up to explain that there has_been several mistakes in the booking and the confirmation_email , and that i will have to accept economy class or pay extra for an upgrad to business !
negative	they offered me a refound , but as we are close to the travel date now , all other tickets are much more_expensive now !
negative	i talked to the airline klm and the can not do anything , but they also warned me for bravofly . com .
negative	please do not do the same mistake as i did , do not book with bravofly . com !
negative	// carl
negative	one to two week delivery , how about one to two months .
negative	was happy up until i clicked the link for the survey to find my real name underneath .
negative	i don_'_t remember giving out permission for you to pass my name over to a third_party ?
negative	i will testify against you when and if the storage manager brings a lawsuit against you .
negative	tried to book a motel in austin , texas , and wound_up with another that had an almost_identical name -- same chain , same neighborhood designation but location 0 0 / 0 miles_away .
negative	immediately after seeing the address , which was not visible onscreen until the booking was completed , called travelocity to ask that it be canceled .
negative	no go .
negative	spoke with half a dozen people who kept apologizing and said they would connect me to a supervisor , but no supervisor ever picked_up or called back .
negative	even left two callback numbers , landline and cell .
negative	this went on and on , call after call , for more than two hours .
negative	finally gave up .
negative	we ' re stuck with staying somewhere far from where we wanted to be .
negative	that '_s it , never dealing_with travelocity again .
negative	booked a number of cars , lodgings and flights over the years , but no more .
negative	there '_s plenty of other_sites out there .
negative	this episode was just horrible .
negative	trying to get a reply from their customer service is very very very poor .
negative	not having a telephone_number you can actually call is very bad for business .
negative	hope they correct these problems for future visitors .
negative	0 / 0 / 0000
negative	i ordered two brake_rotors from partsgeek .
negative	0 of them was damaged and the other was the wrong part .
negative	i submitted a trouble ticket and they said i can return them but that i have to pay the return shipping .
negative	the shipping cost is half of the cost of the rotors .
negative	so basically i have to pay for their mistake .
negative	i '_m never buying from this site again .
negative	i was very unhappy because i asked the gentleman_who was taking my call if i was talking direct with the hotel change i was booking with .
negative	he told me yes .
negative	i went_ahead and made the reservation and was told i had until 00 : 00_pm that night if i changed my mind and did not want the hotel .
negative	well , we did change our mind and called back and was told we had booked a hotel that you could not cancel the reservation .
negative	i was upset and wanted to talk to a supervisor , which they connected me to .
negative	well , this gentleman said he would look into and put me on hold .
negative	well , i got disconnected and had to call back and ask for a supervisor again .
negative	he told me that they would have would give us the credit .
negative	i just did not like to be told we had until that night and then when we called back we got jerked around .
negative	complete_waste of time .
negative	i could have got them from my local boots for few £ s more now it is nearly 0 months and i am still_waiting for my specs .
negative	reserved a hotel through priceline , which awarded me a hotel outside of the area i selected ( approximately 00 miles from the location i wanted ).
negative	it was in priceline '_s own hotel listing outside the area i selected .
negative	priceline refused to refund the transaction .
negative	this will be the last time i '_ll use priceline for anything ... canceling our business account as well .
negative	fast delivery but it was the wrong part .
negative	i didn_'_t have time to wait for another so i had to get one at a local parts store .
negative	not worth the time and effort ot return the part .
negative	i contacted ipromo via phone before ordering my custom usb0 drives because i had had bad_experience with another company .
negative	alex assured me they were different and they would do proper qc on my drives before being shipped .
negative	that didn_'_t happen , instead my drives were shipped straight to me from china and were the exact_same junk drives the other company stuck me with .
negative	i contacted him with screenshots showing their slow speed and now they are trying to stick me with a 00_% restocking_fee for returning slow drives .
negative	all these companies use the same supplier in china and don_'_t ever even see their products .
negative	waste of time and money .
negative	do not buy usb0 drives from this company unless you want usb0 speeds
negative	i waited 0_weeks , never receive my order .
negative	then i realized that it was was marked shipped back to sasa .
negative	within 0_weeks , i '_ve never got any notification from them .
negative	i tried to contact them - their website form was broken .
negative	after google_search , i found their customer service email .
negative	i waited 0 more week for email response .
negative	they just tell me to wait for my package to get there and they will charge me 00_% restocking_fee !!
negative	!
negative	0 more weeks , i emailed them ask for estimated_date - when the package will get back to them .
negative	i waited 0 days to get email response said they will give me refund once they get the package , doesn_'_t tell me when .
negative	i '_ve been very patient for something that '_s not my fault at all .
negative	i '_m an_avid online shopper and this company is the worst i '_ve ever deal with .
negative	ads following me .
negative	feel_like i am being stalked
negative	very dissapointed , when i purchased the glasses the paypal came up with an error , so i went back in and went through the ordering_process again , but the original purchase had gone_through , so i ended_up ordering two pair , within 0 minute i tried to ring and cancel one of my orders but was told it had already been processed !!!!!!!!!!
negative	!
negative	by email i might_add , i was unable to get through any of the phone lines to talk to somebody ????????
negative	?, so the process was more stressful than it should have been , not to mention the added cost and hassles of returning " at additional_cost " to me
negative	so this was not a very good process for me
negative	i must add that the glasses were excellent as was the price
negative	prices are good but don_'_t expect it for about 0_weeks , maybe because i still don_'_t have my order .
negative	this company increased the price of the ticket after i '_ve paid for it , and charged me the additional amount without my consent .
negative	only after 00 emails and phone_calls , my ticket was canceled and money refunded .
negative	avoid .
negative	for a company as large as they are it '_s impressive to witness firsthand what abysmal customer service they have .
negative	was the intended recipient of a personal package that never arrived .
negative	for a case that could have been so simply resolved i now have spent the last 0 months in a runaround with the claims department only to finally be told that i cannot view or challenge the outcome of the claim on the basis that i am only the recipient ( no mind to the fact that it '_s my money spent ).
negative	they tell me only the shipper can do so .
negative	the customer service rep then had the audacity to tell me i cannot file a complaint with her_supervisor because i " do not represent the business using their services to ship "!???
negative	that will_certainly be the truth of the matter henceforth for all my personal and corporate shipping .
negative	done with a company that has little regard for its customers ' satisfaction or its own integrity .
negative	hello ups .
negative	when purchasing the glasses it said that they ship in 0 - 00 days .
negative	0_weeks_later they finally arrived .
negative	not at all worth paying almost 00_% of the actual price of the glasses in shipping and insurance .
negative	the first time i ordered from parts_geek , the parts showed_up a couple of days_later without a glitch .
negative	the second time , i ordered online , the money was confirmed from my account then the next_day i receive an_email that the billing_address didn_'_t match the credit_card address .
negative	well it absolutely does and in fact i used the same card to order my first order with no problem and i havn '_t moved .
negative	i submitted my comments in the customer service tab online to state that was not the case and that i would receive a response within 00 - 00_hours .
negative	i also called numerous_times to the 000 number posted online with over 0 hours wait one time but to no_avail .
negative	i finally wanted to cancel so i could use another company to get the work done when i had the time on the weekend .
negative	i asked to release my money from my account and it took another several days for this to happen causing me to lose a weekend availability for me to do the work .
negative	i went to jc_whitney and ordered the parts with a person on the phone with excellent customer service !
negative	i will not use parts_geek again and will tell others considering using parts_geek to use someone_else .
negative	i got wrong part no one answers phone no email reply .
negative	i was waiting on the shuttle and was told it would be back in about fifteen_minutes .
negative	after using the facilities , i noticed that the shuttle pulled in .
negative	i asked if they would wait while i go and get bags from car .
negative	they said sure .
negative	as i was walking to get bags the shuttle just took off and left .
negative	i then had to wait another thirty_minutes for shuttle to arrive .
negative	this was just uncalled for .
negative	never again will i use this service .
negative	i '_ve ordered many parts from parts_geek over the last few_years and have always been satisified with the parts and service .
negative	i recently ordered an air pump for my car and when i opened the box i found the pump outlet was broken off .
negative	there is no visible damage on the outside of the box which makes it appear that the part was shipped defective .
negative	i now have to pay to ship the component back at my expense .
negative	spend my time reordering the part and wait for it to arrive again .
negative	all in all it is going to take more than 0_weeks for me to get my car back up and running .
negative	absolutely , unacceptable and i have such a foul taste in my mouth from this experience that your cheaper prices may not be incentive enough to continue business with parts_geek .
negative	we thought that we were dealing directly with the hotel .
negative	we booked for 0 nights , thursday thru sunday , and we had to leave one day early , due to an_emergency back home .
negative	the hotel said that there is nothing that they could do because we booked thru expedia .
negative	not good .
negative	we will call the hotel direct or simply walk - in next time .
negative	hotel is great , expedia sucks !
negative	i ended_up paying $_00 . 00 more per_night , due to expedia , and lost $_000 . 00 when i had to leave early , so expedia cost us $_000 . 00 extra .
negative	hampton is not totally off the hook , because it was not mentioned on their website that we were going through a booking agent .
negative	have stayed at hampton inns numerous , numerous_times .
negative	won_'_t happen again !
negative	hampton_inn and expedia both suck !
negative	!
negative	i have not receive my parta .
negative	i am very dissatisfied .
negative	unacceptable - taken my money and delivered nothing !
negative	i got the lights did not work .
negative	the batteres are died not happy .
negative	now i have to go find batters for them .
negative	compared to facebook , myspace just has way to many ads and clutter , i rather stick to facebook , its clean simple and not bombarded with ads .
negative	i ordered a wheel almost a month_ago .
negative	they said it was instock and would ship in a few_days .
negative	i have not received a tracking_number and the website said it has not shipped .
negative	i have sent multiple emails and phone_calls have gotten voicemail and no responses .
negative	but they are happy to hang onto my money .
negative	there customer service is horrible .
negative	buyer_beware !
negative	ordered a regulator for my 0000_chrysler .
negative	part was scheduled to be delivered on thursday the 00th but because partsgeek failed to put my apt number on the shipping_label i did not receive my part till the 00th when called th company offered no solutions
negative	i seem to be spending a lot of time trying to sort a proplem out with my order with very little help from wowcher if i loose this order i will not be using wowcher again my order is with ted and co
negative	ordered a radiator from parts_geek .
negative	delivery was fast ... but my part arrived damaged so i refused it .
negative	called to try and get replacement .
negative	good luck no human available at all .
negative	must fill_out a support_ticket online just to have someone email you in which you can not respond to .
negative	this place is garbage and would not recommend to anyone .
negative	we ordered a part like we do from many vendors .
negative	when you need to rma the part regardless of why ... they will ask you for the number from the " silver_sticker ".
negative	there is no
negative	silver_sticker on the part .
negative	there are 0 other stickers with numbers but no silver_sticker .
negative	they will string you along , then accuse you of removing the sticker .
negative	really ?????
negative	why would anyone peel_off the sticker ??????.
negative	so they tell us there is a silver_sticker on all their parts .... we go look at other parts ( couple batteries ) we have in the office from them ... no silver_sticker ....... suddenly well no not the batteries .
negative	yet they have no_idea if it is their part without the silver_sticker .
negative	most disgusting circling talking dishonest vendor i have encounter in my 00 plus years of doing_business .
negative	do not order from these_people !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
negative	simply , a bad business decision to do_business with dishonest companies and this is one of them .
negative	i '_m slow to anger and i wanted to throttle these_people .
negative	on march 00 , 0000 , i placed and order for two round - trip tickets through travelocity .
negative	i printed all the flight information which included the total charge to my credit_card .
negative	including trip id .
negative	when my credit_card statement arrived there were no charges to my account .
negative	i called customer service and was on hold for over an_hour before a person answered my call .
negative	it was a terrible experience and the person on the other end claimed we had a bad connection , but mostly it was because of his very poor_english .
negative	the conversation went on for another 00_minutes when he went to contact his_supervisor .
negative	i was placed on hold and finally the line disconnected and the called ended with any resolution .
negative	i do not recommend anyone call customer service , it was a terrible experience .
negative	you sent me a request to confirm an address
negative	i confirmed the address was wrong and supplied the correct address as requested
negative	you told me to update it myself using the control_panel
negative	i logged_onto control_panel only to find my new address , not the address on you original email
negative	your support center email dodged giving me a reason for this by supplying none relevant responses to my correspondence .
negative	i still do not know if my old email address is in your direct_debit system
negative	very poor customer_support experience .
negative	i placed the order #_000000000 on december 00 , 0000 0 : 00 : 00 am est ; i need to take this products with me to an internativonal trip i had planned to initiate on january 0 .
negative	products were delivered at home on jan 0 noon , when you were supposed to delivered them within 0 - 0 business days .
negative	the worst service i have seen .
negative	i coudnts take the products with me in my trip oviously .
negative	additinally , you are selling products with experitaions days very close from the purchased date , sin some_cases less_than 0 months before exparing .
negative	wrote a review for phonepower now all of a sudden , " welcome to trustpilot ".
negative	ordered a bathing suit from then based on their size_chart .
negative	suit that arrived was 0 sizes to small for me .
negative	ordered a m and what arrived was a suit made for a woman_who is an xs .
negative	several emails back and forth to the store explaining the problem and just wanted to exchange it for a larger_size .
negative	their attitude was " go f your self , we don_'_t care ".
negative	i would never do_business with them again !
negative	where should i begin ?
negative	i had recently_purchased a new sea doo limited and expected delivery on june 00 .
negative	on june 0rd i placed an order with seadoo . com for a life jacket and wetsuit .
negative	while placing the order the expected delivery date was 0 - 00 days , more than enough time to receive the items before the sea doo was delivered .
negative	after the order was placed i received an_email from shopatron notifying_me of a 0 - 00 day delivery and they would email_confirmation when the items shipped .
negative	after 00 days i emailed shopatron questioning my order status .
negative	0 days_later i received an_email that the order was still being_processed .
negative	at no time was i notified that the items were on back order and would not be available until the end of the summer .
negative	i called sea doo to complain and a life jacket was shipped 0 days_later , this was the first time that they had notified me of the back order status of the remaining items and would not be available til august 00 .
negative	while deciding on cancelling the remaining order or not i received another email from shopatron that the items would be available for delivery on june 00 .
negative	yesterday was july 0 and i received a message from shopatron that the items are still on back order and now the availability date is november .
negative	i called shopatron to cancel the order and after waiting 00_minutes on hold they were very happy to cancel the order .
negative	if shopatron would have notified me that the items were on back order i would never have placed the order or missed a week of being on the water waiting for my items .
negative	rest_assured i will never place an order with any company that uses shopatron .
negative	this will be my one and only experience with this vendor .
negative	beware .
negative	my incident is still ongoing but i have not received my product or a refund or any personal contact from partsgeek .
negative	so_far i am out $_000 and have received nothing from partsgeek .
negative	fedex claims they delivered my package but it is nowhere to be found .
negative	i have already received 0 other packages from amazon this week with no problem , so i don_'_t believe it was stolen .
negative	fedex closed my incident and said contact vendor .
negative	partsgeek has only sent generic auto - response emails which are confusing .
negative	they recognized i never received my package yet they said they would have fedex come inspect my package and they created a return merchandise authorization ( rma ) on my behalf .
negative	again i have no merchandise to return .
negative	i responded to their confusing email_asking for clarification and to call me personally to resolve .
negative	they sent another generic auto - response email that my message was receive and someone will follow_up during normal business hours in 00 - 00_hours .
negative	i have yet to feel any sort of personal customer care or service and i have no faith i will receive direct contact in the next two_days .
negative	it will then be the weekend and another week will have passed .
negative	i am at the unfortunate point of calling my credit_card company to reverse payment to this vendor for what can only be seen as a fraudulent charge at this time .
negative	shame on you partsgeek .
negative	this could and should have easily been resolved .
negative	i have learned my lesson and will only buy through amazon even if the price is higher .
negative	poor communication you call and leave 0 messages no one returns you call . they send you the wrong copper size wire will not return you phone_call .
negative	bob storage did not have any confirmation
negative	the truck that was promised was given to somebody_else
negative	and the the red that i was quoted was last in the red i have to pay .
negative	overall now it will cost me about a hundred_dollars more then i had budgeted
negative	please tell me how i '_m going to make that up
negative	bill cornell
negative	( private_data )
negative	goods arrived damaged , rang the company 00_minutes after goods arrived only to be told it was not there responsability .
negative	after many phone_calls and threat of trading_standards was a replacement sent .
negative	very happy with the goods , shame the after sale was so poor .
negative	0_stars for product 0_stars for after sales .
negative	i started the process of moving my gas and electric from cooperative energy to edf over 0_weeks_ago , and they still have not yet managed to complete the process properly .
negative	the electricity transferred without problem , but the gas account kept showing as " not ready yet ".
negative	it was only when i contacted them , after the scheduled transfer date had passed without my being asked for a meter_reading , that they identified a problem .
negative	however the staff could not work out what the problem was .
negative	they got me emailing them photographs of my meter and all_sorts of other nonsense , before eventually sending me a template email_stating that the problem lay with cooperative and it was my responsibility to contact cooperative to sort it out .
negative	edf then initiated a new change over process for the gas .
negative	i have just now , finally , received an_email from edf saying " we ' re now ready for your gas meter_reading ".
negative	but , surprise_surprise , when i log on to the website , there is no option to submit a gas reading , and when i phone the automated meter_reading line , i get the message " we ' re not quite ready for your gas reading yet ".
negative	perhaps the problem is not entirely of edf '_s making , but their customer service has_been non_- existent .
negative	the wait continues .
negative	what a shambles .
negative	not worth doing biss .
negative	with ..
negative	i ordered 0 pistons .
negative	box came with only one inside .. called for 0 days with not getting threw to anyone .
negative	opened a issue within the web_page with the page stateing will call in 00 - 00_hrs .
negative	0 days_later all i get is an_email_asking me to rate them here .
negative	so here is the rating ..
negative	why have you taken money from my account two months before i get to the hotel ?
negative	do i win the 00 dollars ????
negative	?
negative	i wanted to change my flight , and tried for two_days to get in touch with bravofly by e_-_mail and phone , and was not able to get any contact at all .
negative	result ; a very expencive return ticket .
negative	not good , and never bravofly again !
negative	i order a part and pay but i never received and they keep my money
negative	this company screwed_up my reservation and caused me to have to sleep on the curb monday_morning .
negative	they booked me for the wrong days and all the hotels in the area were full .
negative	they also gave_me a bunch of mis_- information on the hotel .
negative	they told me complimentary_breakfast and a smoking_room .
negative	the hotel did not have complimentary_breakfast , and the entire hotel was non smoking .
negative	i will never book with this company again .
negative	i was quoted online $ 0000 but when my confirmation came i was overcharged $_000 .
negative	this will be my last trip booked with travelocity .
negative	horrible customer service and very misleading website .
negative	i will be disputing the additional_charge and turning this over to a legal expert for review .
negative	i had ordered some radio_knobs for my factory 00 gmc jimmy , picture on their site showed the correct part , 0 knobs total of varies sizes , the ones they sent only had 0 knobs , 0 small & 0 same size large , they did send me an_rma but i had to pay for the return .
negative	they said in their email that the picture does do necessary represent the part , how else would know ?
negative	i purchased a game code for guild_wars two , and it said i had to verify and it couldnt use mobile_phone , so i had no way to verify unless i verified through documentation , but i had no camera too take pictures with therefore i paid for something i did not recieve .
negative	they sent it in a box folded in half .
negative	it was supposed to be rigid and it is flexible like a wet piece of cardboard .
negative	very dissapointed !
negative	i placed on order with ark pets for an aquarium filter .
negative	0 days_later i realised that it was not going to be any good for my tank so i cancelled .
negative	i emailed them and received a confirmation_email_confirming the cancellation and informing that it was to be refunded .
negative	this was on the 00 th of february it '_s now the 00st of march and i '_ve just had to contact my bank to today to file a dispute to get my money back , even_though i further contacted ark pets on the 00th of march and asked why it was taking so long ?
negative	and was told it had been chased up with accounts , and i would be contacted in the next couple of days to confirm the refund .
negative	this did not happen .
negative	in my opinion they are either chancing their arm that people will not check the bank for the refund .
negative	or they really are that poorly organised they cannot perform a simple refund .
negative	looking at the other reviews this seems to be a common_practice for them so either way they are untrustworthy and i will not be using them again .
negative	i '_m writing this to see just how many other people this has happened to .
negative	i '_ve switched away from first utility and found that i was in credit a couple of hundred_pounds .
negative	so of course phoned up shortly_after to get my money back and was told i couldn_'_t claim the money until they had received the reading from the new supplier .
negative	even_though i knew the reading would be the same as the final reading i had already given to them i waited a week and rang again .
negative	my call was answered finally ( it '_s true what they say to get through generally takes at_least 00_mins ) by a gentleman_who when i asked for my money back told me instantly that he would get it sent out to me .
negative	but you know when you just know someone is lying , like i could tell he had a grin on his face when he was telling_me " he would get it sent out ".
negative	and surprise_surprise i phone up 0_weeks_later and the girl tells_me there is no record of any correspondence on my account since april !
negative	so now the forms have to be filled in and sent to their finance dept and it will take another month so i won_'_t see my money until january .
negative	i just wonder_how much of this is down to a lazy employee or company strategy to keep earning interest on our money as now it will be 0 months before i get my money back .
negative	i know they all do it but if you have a similar experience please share .
negative	if 00 , 000 people switch away and are owed an average of £_000 that '_s £ 0million !
negative	interesting .....
negative	will never used this company again .
negative	told them to cancel the order via_email .
negative	just discovered they charged my credit_card sunday , three_weeks after making the order .
negative	they never acknowledged any attempts to contact them .
negative	worse experience ever with a mail order .
negative	i would have given them a zero star , but it was not an option .
negative	wrong part in box .
negative	cost me the shipping for there mistake !
negative	i '_ll think hard before i order any thing else
negative	the delivery was not put through as ordered .
negative	the delivery did not reach me when i asked for it which_meant that the deliverer who was not at fault had to make special arrangements .
negative	i am disabled and ran_out of oil completely which_meant i had to pay to have the system re - primed .
negative	i do want to thank the company that delivered for making a special effort .
negative	however i would not rate boiler_juice as the email i recieved and the process of getting my order filled did not match .
negative	my reccommendation is to go direct to a local company and avoid the problems of dealing_with three parties .
negative	thats what i will do in future .
negative	they game me the code went and typed it in said it had already been used and its a huge hassel to get your money back
negative	we booked a room at the comfort_inn in pegion forge tn for a friday_night and the the reservation was made for sat .
negative	instead of friday .
negative	we spent almost 0 hrs trying to get the reservation changed to friday and i still don_'_t know for sure if they did what i asked .
negative	we will never book here again .
negative	bought an item through mighty_deals .
negative	item didn_'_t work , so i contacted mighty_deals about a return and was given an e_-_mail address to contact the merchant .
negative	this e_-_mail address doesn_'_t work , and despite a couple of phone_calls ( last one i was on hold for over 00_minutes ) and numerous e_-_mails to mighty_deals i am unable to contact them to find another method of contacting the merchant .
negative	don_'_t waste your money buying things through mighty_deals !
negative	the billing screen was brutal .
negative	i have no friends at identity_guard except the one lady that told be in the very beginning of this mess to fax in a request to cancel my sons account and the reason_why ?
negative	i have been paying more for his service than my own .
negative	i have talked to customer service probably six times now to where i told them to call me at this point .
negative	i wrote a long and quite disturbing letter i am sure to a supervisor named heather and not one person told me i could cancel the account online through the faq '_s i poured my heart out to these_people about my sons problems and illnesses and wrote on final time to let them know that i found out his identity had been stolen when he was 0 years old i just found this out by the same person_who stole all my money while i was seeking domestic violence help .
negative	his identity was recently used again in 0000 and all i got was we can '_t cancel the acct maa '_m he is an adult now .
negative	i said and yes this adult pays the membership each month and he has_been institutionalized for the last_year .
negative	get your policies straight because it really hurt me to have to tell you information that is really none of anyone '_s business and i want credits back on my credit_card from the very beginning of all this starting .
negative	i also suffer with mental illness and am on medication and did not deserve to be treated like some psycho i can become psycho if i don_'_t take my meds properly but i will be looking for those credits within the next week and nobody ever updated his account to a gold account so there is sneakiness going on behind the scenes .
negative	i am sorry for this type of review but your company has left me no choice the bad part will be when he comes home and we have to face the police like he hasn_'_t had enough already .
negative	ordered a mirror for my f000 fx0 that i needed for a trade - in .
negative	my parts was shipped with no protective packing_material , no invoice or paperwork , damaged ( broken anchor post bolt ).
negative	the most disappointing aspect of my complaint is that the broken piece that separated from the mirror wasn_'_t is the box !!
negative	some brain surgeon shipped the part damaged .. then when contacting part geek , i find that i cannot_speak to anyone , i had to fill_out a ticket and would hear for them in 00 - 00_hrs .. not what i call " great customer service " i tried to speak to anyone at parts_geek and was on hold for over 00 min to only get disconnected ...
negative	i would have been better off spending more at the dealer and getting what i needed .
negative	je_ne recommande pas ce site pour_l achat de voyages avec hôtel car je me suis retrouvé sans hôtel le soir de_mon arrivée merci ebookers les vacances commencent bien .
negative	de plus des frais sur_le paiement sont appliqués par carte bleue nous sommes en 0000 pourtant
negative	they didn_'_t have what i ordered and took the money im still_waiting to get refund
negative	i serched the website for a fuel_pump for a toyota_corolla fuel_pump and was given a parts number .
negative	when i got the part it won_'_t connect to the wiring_harness .
negative	another site web serch reveals the problem , the part is for a toyota_pickup_truck .
negative	a check of the confirmation_email shows corolla .
negative	now i have to send it back for refund , less restocking_charge , and either reorder or get it elsewhere .
negative	is the website giving me the correct part number this time ?
negative	should i go to another site ?
negative	will i get the right part this time , or another restocking_fee ?
negative	i think i '_ll go old_fashioned and go to a local parts store .
negative	no waiting for days , and service i can trust .
negative	i have been a mechanic for over 00 years and have never had this poor of service .
negative	this company sent the wrong part and took 0 days to respond and tell me it is my problem .
negative	they don_'_t answer the phone and send e_-_mails that can '_t be responded to .
negative	i will never buy from this company again because of the extremely poor customer service .
negative	no company should expect the customer to incur additional_charges when the parts were ordered correctly from their catalog that was incorrect .
negative	i will_certainly tell other mechanics and friends to avoid this company because of the stated issues .
negative	to add_insult to injury they tell me to return the part with insured mail , insinuating that they may " loose it " and not give proper credit .
negative	this is probably an issue that the better business_bureau would be very interested in reviewing .
negative	i booked the reservation on the ocmoputer and then wanted to add a 0nd room for the same hotel and the same night .
negative	to my dismay i couldnt do that .
negative	i send an_email and never got a reply ... i called the next_day and 0 operators couldnt get my information ... i repeat 0 different employees ... i kept asking for a supervisor and iwas told that none were avail .
negative	i finaslly got someone that was able to book the second room , at a rate double to the one is booked ... after 0 more phone_calls and about 0 hr of run - a - round by your representives , i finally calls another motel chain and booked 0 room with them .
negative	it is sad that you are loosing business with the ignorate staff and itheir inablilty to listen and comply with a custome '_s requests ..
negative	they lost our car keys , were 00_mins late to take us home in a taxi as the car keys were missing .
negative	i did not revive my car back until the following evening with no fule in it after being promised a full_tank in compensation .
negative	still ongoing compliant .
negative	do not recommend !
negative	when i first came_across the clutch_kit i needed from partsgeek , i was amazed by the fantastic price compared to local parts stores in my area .
negative	i was excited to do the install , so i opened the box after receiving it and i spotted a broken part .
negative	i figured sh_* t happens , so i immediately contacted partsgeek '_s customer service and have yet to receive a response .
negative	it '_s day three and i have lost all hope in receiving a response .
negative	i ended_up buying the same clutch_kit from a local store and have completed the install .
negative	i wonder_why it takes partsgeek so long to return a response ?
negative	they sure took no time at all to take the money from my account .
negative	i wish my experience on no do - it - yourselfer .
negative	take my advice .
negative	buy local because in situations like mine you ' re going to wish you did .
negative	i ordered three parts from parts_geek .
negative	motor_mounts .
negative	none zero of them were the brand i ordered .
negative	the parts i did receive were damaged and inferior .
negative	one even had been welded together !
negative	absolute crap .
negative	they have not been willing to replace them with the ones i actually ordered .
negative	the worst customer service i have ever had the misfortune to come_across .
negative	one week_later and my order still_hasn_'_t arrived !, yet they managed to send me this email to complete a survey !,
negative	telephoned them they said one of the items was out of stock , so they ' d ring me back that afternoon , they didn_'_t !
negative	tomorrow i '_m cancelling my order and will be telling all of my friends about this and my pt clients .
negative	i would not use again , email with full complaint sent to customer_services .
negative	basically my niece is now required yo go through this nonsense to get the redemption / value of the gift game_cards :
negative	" to receive a replacement card please do the following .
negative	send a screen print of the error_message you are receiving when attempting to activate the code .
negative	a .
negative	how to take a screen print .
negative	- press the " print screen " button on your keyboard .
negative	- paste the screen print into a paint program .
negative	- save the screen print image to your computer .
negative	- reply to this email and add the screen print as an attachment .
negative	******************************
negative	so apparently the person receiving the gift of the game_cards has the burden of jumping_through the hoops to receive valid card numbers and the value of the gift .
negative	this is patently absurd and most_likely i will make no further_purchases from pc_game_supply .
negative	they may have lost a customer .
negative	found the part i needed , site said it was in stock , and ordered the part i needed .
negative	transaction was easy on pp .
negative	0 days_later i get a refund notice from pp and an_email_saying it was out of stock and they had no_idea when it would be back in stock .
negative	why list the part when you don_'_t have it ....... bad practice and im done with them , will stick will rock_auto or jegs who deliver what they say is in stock !
negative	i do not have a mailbox at my house so i have a p . o .
negative	box for my mail .
negative	i receive most packages from ups or fedex .
negative	they do not mail to p . o . boxes , there for i did not receive the products that i ordered because they would not send it to me via_ups or fedex very disappointing .
negative	had to call three_times just to book an extra room !
negative	operators could barely_speak_english , and obviously haven_'_t mastered the " hold " function of their phones .
negative	each call i got progressively further into the booking process , only to have to call back and start from the beginning .
negative	if i absolutely didn_'_t have to book this stay , my business would have immediately gone elsewhere .
negative	it '_s not like marriott can '_t afford to have world class customer service , and their decision to outsource their reservations to this company will cost them dearly .
negative	received a part that was clearly defective .
negative	the return of part was at my expense and inconvenience .
negative	felt i would never see a refund .
negative	i ordered two front turnsignal lights and a rear light cover from partsgeek .
negative	the turn lights were shipped first in a large box four times their size with absolutely no packaging to protect them .
negative	thankfully they were usable .
negative	the light cover however , shipped later , part in carton once again no packaging , was crushed with pieces of plastic falling out .
negative	i had fedex .
negative	come_back and return it .
negative	it '_s not their fault if you package your shipments poorly !
negative	i was charged a 00_% restocking_fee for refusing a damaged package .
negative	don_'_t waste your time with partsgeek !
negative	booked a hotel in sf toward the end of may .
negative	i called to cancel my reservation and get a refund because i broke my leg .
negative	it was still a month away but i was told there is a no refund no cancellation_policy .
negative	basically i was screwed out of $_000 . 00 .
negative	they wouldn_'_t even take a medical reason .
negative	tablet was not fixed within 0 hours , as_advertised , and this was even when i had dropped it off in person at the office .
negative	there was not any transit time included as there will be once the kiosks are fully_operational .
negative	receptionist also asked if i wanted to go_ahead and pay for the work prior to my being_able to verify that the work was done .
negative	what '_s up with that ?
negative	please , i beg you , if you want to avoid stress and nervous breakdown as well as money wasted on phone_calls caused_by utter incompetence stay_away from this online company !!!!!!!!!
negative	!
negative	i ordered a part that was advertised as new on the website , but when i received the part it was covered in dust .
negative	so i wrote the company they stated it was used despite advertising it as new , they offered no apologies .. never buying anything_else from them ... i like to get what i pay for .
negative	placed my order on 00 - 00 .
negative	received my parts 0 day later .
negative	opened the box and found one of the parts was broken .
negative	i immediately went to the site and filled_out the support_ticket ( the fastest way to get in touch with them ).
negative	0 days_later after many attempts to get in touch with someone i get an e_-_mail that read hello sorry for the delay the past few day we have a high amount of help tickets and are trying our best to get to them all as per your broken cooling_fan i have to contact the vendor and they will do one of two things reship you the part for free or refund you in full for the part upon their response i will get back to you asap
negative	sorry for the inconvenience
negative	parts_geek
negative	now it has_been another week with no further contact from them no refund no replacement part .
negative	this company is a joke .
negative	i ordered an item on line , paid for it by paypal and received emails from both acknowledging the order and payment .
negative	several days_later i received an_email fro paypal refunding my payment but nothing from cashgenerator explaining why the item was not available .
negative	there may have been a reasonable explanation but silence ensued - this is poor service and i will not return to the site as there are better on retailers on line .
negative	i had a horrible experience with houseofbrides . com .
negative	i would not recommend ordering from them at all !
negative	they are not even accredited by the bbb .
negative	beware !
negative	they are rude and do not stand by what they say !
negative	compré un set de hierros que tenían en stock , me enviaron uno similar ( de menor precio ) y cuando protesté me dijeron que_el otro no lo tenían .
negative	la opción que me dieron era que yo pagara la devolución y cuando recibieran los hierros me devolvían el_dinero de_los palos y_el_envío .
negative	me dijeron que su transportista no podía recoger en mi casa ... los gastos_de aduana e impuestos ( vivo en canarias ) que he pagado y_el tiempo transcurrido ( ya hace 0 meses del pago ) son cosa mía ...
negative	me han ofrecido un bono de 00 libras , pero cualquier cosa que pida tiene 00 libras de gastos_de envío , trámite aduanero ( además de_los impuestos ) y además , cada palo que pregunto me dicen que no lo tienen ( sólo pregunto por palos que dicen tener en stock )
negative	llevamos 00 emails y aún sigo esperando solución .
negative	i '_m not sure but every time i use amazon , it seems like my credit_card number gets stolen and used .
negative	i did not receive the wine yet !
negative	!
negative	having booked with this company before and being pleased with the service , we decided to use them for our recent booking . having selected fss we duly booked and turned_up on 00 / 00 / 0000 to park for 0 week . as it was 0 . 00am it was pitch black . we booked in and were duly escorted onto a rather rickety bus and taken to the airport - so_far so good .
negative	on our return , we followed the instructions supplied and the bus eventually came , we noticed many other parking sites had a constant supply of shuttles . we once again boarded a rather old bus and as we pulled_into the shuttle park we noticed the car had some damage . on closer_inspection , it had been badly scrorped on the nearside wheel arch . we reported this and were told they had a computer image taken at 0 . 00am ( bearing in mind we arrived at 0 . 00am ) and it must have been brought in by us with the damage already there . we found this most insulting .
negative	we wrote in and they want nothing to do with it so my advice to you is would you trust the integrity of this outfit as they tried to transfer the blame onto us . thankfully , something stopped me from booking for parking for a second holiday which we have booked in the not too_distant future and we will never use parking facilities again and will advise friends and family to do likewise
negative	seems as though if u have a problem there is absolutely no phone_number to call ...
negative	i like speaking to a live_person and was unable to do which was extremely disappointing and frustrating
negative	do not buy parts from these_guys , i was sold a defective_part and had to pay for shipping and the return shipping !
negative	horrible customer service !
negative	i order a front rifle sight from midway .
negative	after two_weeks of waiting i called to find out where it was and they said it was lost and the product is now on back - order .
negative	i '_m sure glad the extra $ 0 handling_charge , stuck on at the very end , worked .
negative	brownells has the part on the way .
negative	wrong part was delivered the photo on website is the one i needed you sent me a totally different style of fuel_tank hole for sending unit is in wrong place and stem is too short can someone call me at 000 ) 000 - 0000 regarding this matter ....
negative	we ordered a vanity for our bathroom .
negative	it was delivered on time , but there were several issues with the item ( it didn_'_t match the sketch that could be found online , so the plumbing had to be redone - the basin had a crack and leaked - another part was missing - the door had a scratch ).
negative	i have spent hours on the phone with mainfaucet employees , all of them were very nice - but the communication between them really didn_'_t work , so i had to call back multiple_times .
negative	we had to have the plumber come_back out , which of course he charged us for .
negative	so , overall , not a pleasant_experience and it would have been better to buy locally .
negative	received bent regulater
negative	first off , i want to tell you that i have had a positive_experience with your book it . com website multiple_times .
negative	the experience i have just had was a bad one .
negative	i tried to book a trip online to cancun to surprise my wife for our_anniversary and wanted to keep it a surprise .
negative	i filled_out all the necessary information and hit_submit .
negative	error screen with a number to call customer service .
negative	upon_calling customer service i talked to a very nice lady that wanted to help me out .
negative	i explained my situation and she was willing to help out .
negative	she offered to try to book it again because she said that the transaction didn_'_t necessarily go through .
negative	we spent over an_hour trying to rebook my trip and after a long time on the phone we got it booked only to find out that the first booking went through .
negative	i got charged_twice for the same trip , flight , everything .
negative	she told me to hold again so she could cancel one of them and i would get a full_refund .
negative	after assuring she canceled it we hung_up the phone and went about my day .
negative	i went on the bookit . com site a few minuets later and noticed that both of the duplicate trips were still confirmed .
negative	i called customer service again to find out what happened and a nice man told me he was sorry for the mix_up and would give me a full_refund and cancel one of the trips .
negative	i held for probably 0 - 00 min and he assured me that he had cancelled one of the trips and i would get a full_refund .
negative	we hung_up and went about our day .
negative	i later looked at the confirmation_email of the cancelation only to realize that i would get a refund for the hotel but i would have to settle for a flight credit in the amount that the flight was booked for .
negative	i did not accept this as a " full_refund " as the man had said as it was the booking agents error that i got charged_twice before for the same trip .
negative	i called customer service again .
negative	i talked to the agent this time , admittedly upset , and tried to explain to him what was going on .
negative	it was like he wasn_'_t even listening to me and just told me that " sorry , that is the airlines policy and there is nothing i can do about it ."
negative	at this point i was furious because i was not about to pay for bookit . com '_s mistake .
negative	only when i demanded my money back and asked to talk to a manager , this man said he would look into it further .
negative	after 00 - 00 min on hold he came back and said he " voided " the cancelation which i didn_'_t know what that meant but i asked if i would be getting my money back , he said yes , he thanked me for calling and we hung_up .
negative	i just got my money back so i am satisfied with that , however , i work in the service business and i felt that the service i received was very subpar .
negative	i should not have to call customer service as many_times as i did to get an issue straightened_out .
negative	not only this but the surprise element of our trip is ruined .
negative	my wife came home from work early to see and hear me talking on the phone with different customer service agents after the transaction should have been over .
negative	steve
negative	this company sent me the wrong part and calling them is even worser services
negative	booked our hotel and received a confirmation .
negative	drove over 000_miles to the hotel and find out we have don_'_t have a room and the hotel is completely booked .
negative	after an_hour and a half of speaking to customer service , and them calling the hotel saying it was there fault .
negative	they sent a fax of our confirmation while we were there .
negative	the hotel we booked was at no fault but priceline was putting there mistake onto the hotel .
negative	the best solution they gave_us is a hotel over 00 miles_away .
negative	they wouldn_'_t pay for compensation to the the nearest hotel .
negative	after them trying to book us and telling us we were confirmed at a hotel that is booked they had poor customer service and didn_'_t give anything for a waste of time and our travel .
negative	never book from here because they don_'_t care about their customers .
negative	all they care about is that 00 digit card number .
negative	honestly , the worst service i have ever_experienced !!
negative	the pc was almost 0_weeks late being delivered .
negative	if i hadn_'_t called them , it may never have been shipped out ( i noticed they shipped it a few hours after i called them asking why it '_s almost 0_weeks late ).
negative	then the pc has hardware issues .
negative	when you call the 000 number , chances are you will get a busy signal or a circuit is busy message .
negative	now i '_m out more money paying to ship it back to get my original money back .
negative	please use my pain and suffering to your benefit .
negative	do not use this company !!
negative	!
negative	very poor return_policy and also hard to communicate with .
negative	are there real people who can solve customers problems anymore ?
negative	not worth the risk even if parts are less_than other_sites .
negative	customer service is more important than price and parts_geek is one of the poorest i have used and will not order from them again .
negative	your ad was misleading along with your employee .
negative	i understood i was connected directly with the hotel chain , not a reseller of rooms .
negative	i did get the rental_car but to add an_additional drive was a quarter of the cost to rent the car your site should have a place for other drivers and have a phone_number to call you at 0000 ?
negative	would be nice i will most_likely not rent again through this site again or recommend it do to not getting any response from your email system or a way to call you .
negative	partsgeek shipped me the wrong part .
negative	to return the part i must pay for return shipping .
negative	whats wrong with that picture ?
negative	i will not use parts again ... ever
negative	should say $_00 shipping plus " premium shipping " for lp grab bags .
negative	i went to add a grab bag to an order , and it changed my shipping to premium .
negative	the discount items i was going to buy would have been overpriced with that shipping .
negative	i took out the grab bag .
negative	i went to order a grab bag separately and it said $_00 shipping .
negative	in the checkout it added premium shipping .
negative	should say premium plus $_00 extra .
negative	that makes the grab bag not a good bargain .
negative	do not go there they charged me 000 . 00 for 00 . 00
negative	first as we all know toys - r - us is extremely overpriced everyone '_s best bet is to goto wal_- mart or target , second they have very deceptive business_practices most extended_warranties are legit there '_s is not i purchased a mercedes_benz power wheels for my son the cashier asked me 0 times to purchase a warranty and she then pointed_out this worry free guarantee and said quote " even if your item gets run over , scratched , damaged for any reason we will repair it or question free send you a gift_card to replace it ".
negative	after 0 year or so i call the warranty department because the mirrors which are only held in by tape came off and broke , the pedal didn_'_t work right , and the battery or board went bad .
negative	after the warranty department finally got back to me the kept telling_me it must be the motor they sent a motor and wanted me to install it but in the warranty plans it states they will repair it not me then when that didn_'_t work they told me too bad sorry about your luck .
negative	it will cost us too much to replace the unit maybe if you talk to toys - r - us they will refund some of the warranty , so basically they take your money and if you do make a claim they just refuse it and tell u maybe there will be a refund for some of the plan .
negative	but toys - r - us staff are forced to up - sale this plan to all guests knowing its a fraud but it is a very profitable business for them it could account for 00_% of profits .
negative	and whats worst the pray on children leaving the child out in the cold with no toy that you purchased a plan on .
negative	ebay is in business only for there self they could care less about there customers they will rip anyone off and not even look bad stay_away pay a little more and goto amazon or buy at your local store
negative	at first i was excited because of the price they offered but later was sent an_email that they did not have the part in stock but on the buy item page it stated they had more than 0 in stock , im upset they didnt notify me in timr
negative	received wrong part and all i could get out of parts_geek was the return
negative	dept .
negative	boilerplate email .
negative	paid for shipping to me and back to them , and still don_'_t have the correct part .
negative	no more parts_geek !
negative	i ordered a used book and expected it to be delivered in a few_days since i am just up the freeway from you in aloha .
negative	the book was ordered on 0 / 00 and arrived on 0 / 00 ; 0 class meetings had passed after the book was ordered before it arrived
negative	to me , this is unacceptable .
negative	i do not fully_understand_why this happened as there was no_indication of a 0rd_party being involved , but facts are facts .
negative	i would much rather support a local company , but after this i will stick to ordering my books from amazon .
negative	very disappointed .
negative	wrote a review over a month_ago and got no response .
negative	please do not contact me again .
negative	i chose a dryer and it was listed as in stock and ordered it based on promised speedy_delivery .
negative	it was not delivered and i got no notice of back order .
negative	i had to call when delivery date was missed .
negative	they suggested a higher_priced model which they swore was in stock , and expedited delivery .
negative	they shopped my purchase to another company which shipped in 0 days , not the next_day as hdtvdreams promised .
negative	expedited delivery was normal delivery .
negative	do not do_business with them .
negative	i purchased a transmission dipstick for my car .
negative	the product advertised on the site supposedly fit a range of make years that included the year of my car .
negative	the dipstick is about a foot too_long to fit my car .
negative	now their customer_support tells_me that that '_s the way this dipstick is supposed to fit .
negative	not true .
negative	this place was totally dirty and full of homeless people and drug users .
negative	when i arrived at the motel they didn_'_t have me in the system .
negative	then when i got my room it was dirty at 0 : 00 in the afternoon .
negative	then i got relocated to another room that would not lock , and i was finally relocated to a third room .
negative	this room had a kitchenette .
negative	overall it was a dump , do not go there .
negative	believe it or not this is the short version .
negative	my wife booked two roundtrip airfares that subsequently had to be cancelled , before departure , because of illness .
negative	because the original ( cancelled ) tickets were non_- refundable we could not receive a refund .
negative	however the cancellation confirmation_email sent to us by travelocity stated : " you will need to have the ticket number ( s ) listed in the passenger information section below when you are ready to use any remaining ticket value toward a new reservation .
negative	please call us at 000 - 000 - 0000 to book your next trip ."
negative	when i called the number indicated in the cancellation confirmation to " book [ my ] next trip " the travelocity agent was unable to find in their records any reference to the ticket number they themselves had provided me in the cancellation confirmation .
negative	she put me on hold and after several minutes another agent told me it didn_'_t make any difference about the ticket number because i had to contact the airline carrier issuing the ticket ( and thus the number ) to re - book .
negative	like a schmuck i believed this guy ( hey - i was trying to spend more money with them !)
negative	and over several days spent an_hour or so speaking , and doing detective work , with two of the airlines involved in the original ( now cancelled ) booking .
negative	among other things , in doing my detective work with the airlines , i found out that the reason travelocity could not find the ticket number contained in their own cancellation confirmation was because the ticket number they provided me ( in writing ) was an incomplete 00 digit ( vs . a correct actual 00 digit ) number .
negative	i was also advised that the original ticket had to be re - booked with the original broker / issuer ( travelocity in this case ) in order to " use any remaining ticket value toward [ the ] new reservation ."
negative	all of which made sense because , unlike what i had been told by the second travelocity agent , the airline '_s understanding of the re - booking process was the same as that contained in the text of travelocity '_s email cancellation confirmation : specifically "... when you are ready to use any remaining ticket value toward a new reservation .
negative	please call us at 000 - 000 - 0000 to book your next trip .
negative	... we look_forward to helping you plan your next trip !"
negative	so ...
negative	i again called travelocity at the telephone_number they had provided in the cancellation confirmation , reached an agent , was put on hold , connected to another agent , gave that agent the correct ticket number ( the one i had gotten from one of the carrier airlines ) and was again told ( incorrectly ) that i had to contact the airline ( s ) to re - book .
negative	after_hearing this yet again from this second agent i summarized for him my conversations with the carriers and referred him to the specific relevant language in the travelocity cancellation confirmation_email for the booking .
negative	the agent retrieved the cancellation confirmation and i referred him to the relevant portions of the text ; he refused to acknowledge the relevance of this and insisted again that i had to contact the original carrier airline to re - book .
negative	why , i asked_him , would travelocity send a cancellation confirmation telling_me that "... when you are ready to use any remaining ticket value toward a new reservation .
negative	please call us at 000 - 000 - 0000 to book your next trip " if in fact that had to be done by one of the carrier airlines ?
negative	as i continued to cite another portion of the cancellation confirmation instructions the agent began speaking over me while i was still talking - at which point this whole pathetic exercise degenerated into a shouting match and i ended the call .
negative	after this unhappy exchange i then again called the original travelocity contact number , got another agent , briefly explained the situation , got put on hold , was connected to another agent , re - explained the situation , requested access to someone in a supervisory capacity , provided my telephone_number , and was told a supervisor would call me back and i was " next up ."
negative	today is friday ; that call was monday .
negative	that same monday i also sent an_email to mediacustomercare @ travelocity . com on this same matter and requested i be contacted .
negative	travelocity '_s reply by return email that same day stated in part " this email serves as an acknowledgement that we ’ ve received your email and look_forward to assisting you with this reservation .
negative	... we will respond to you within the next 00_hours with an update and status of our efforts ."
negative	today is friday and i '_ve received no further contact much less an " update ".
negative	bottom_line ?
negative	i think i can guess what travelocity llc is up to here and it ain '_t pretty ; maybe it rises to the level of theft by deception and maybe it '_s wire fraud - or maybe not .
negative	but one thing is for sure : in the house of online commerce these_guys are termites .
negative	i '_ve done a lot of traveling for both business and pleasure and i '_ve worked with a lot of companies but if you ' re thinking about transacting business with travelocity my advice to you is don_'_t - you '_ll be better off picking_up a hand full of dirt and eating it because you '_ll enjoy that as much as dealing_with these_people and it won_'_t cost you nearly as much .
negative	i purchased these stainless_steel bolts and nuts and found them to be of sub_standard quality .
negative	they were 0 / 00 " bolts and when i tried to use tighten the nuts on the bolts i could nut get them to tighten up .
negative	the threads on them seemed to be not right .
negative	when i tried to back the nuts off the bolts bent .
negative	i was only using a 0 inch wrench and a philips head screwdriver to tighten and remove them .
negative	looks_like more chinese_junk .
negative	don_'_t waste your money .
negative	this company is beyond poor .
negative	their website is misleading , their delivery times are inconsistent and extrelmely long .
negative	their sales support is pathetic .
negative	after ordering a numberi of lp '_s , they have been arriving individually , extremely late .
negative	indeed , two albums have yet to arrive .
negative	in the meantime , one of their packages actually contained an envelope containing a cd addressed to another customer .
negative	these_guys are so bad , they could actually kill online retailing .
negative	come_back hmv - we need you .
negative	in the meantime , igrooves inc should be barred from operating .
negative	i actually wanted to award no stars , but it seems i have to give a minimum of one !
negative	the filters were small and light_weight so why the over charge
negative	for shipping .
negative	they arrived in a timely_manor .
negative	would have
negative	rather paid reasonable shipping and waited a few more days .
negative	fast service but you pay dearly for it .
negative	i orderd a pair of front calipers for mach 0 mustang .
negative	a pair meaning a lf and a rf .
negative	i received 0 lf calipers .
negative	i sent back to california .
negative	waited 0_weeks for them to refund my account .
negative	ordered another rf caliper , received no email_saying it was shipped .
negative	shows up on my door_step one day and these morons sent another lf caliper .
negative	done dealing_with them .
negative	i then found all_kinds of reviews saying stay_away and scam_artists .
negative	they have zero customer_support and throughout this wjole mess they kept making the same excuse .
negative	" we are a drop shipment operation and have no control over incorrect parts ".
negative	should have known better considering this shitty company is based out of new_jersey .
negative	end rant .
negative	i clicked on this site on my phone in error , thinking i was getting the la_quinta site .
negative	they reserved the la_quinta room in the wrong town , 000_miles_away - when i drove 00 miles to get my room , i found out their error , plus the hotel ( and the rest of the town ) were sold out .
negative	i had repeated the paso robles city name 0 times to the girl ( turns_out she was in the philippines ) and she reserved rancho cordoba instead - not even close .
negative	the supervisor acted_like they were doing me a big favor by saying they would waive the cancellation_fee !
negative	why was i charged shipping ??????????????????
negative	its says free shipping .
negative	will not use bh_photo again !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
negative	!
negative	they claimed 0 - 0 days for delivery .
negative	it '_s now eight days from order and it hasn_'_t even shipped .
negative	when i asked why not , they ignored me .
negative	update_: the shipment information was received by fedex after ten days , but the product has yet to leave pothek '_s facility .
negative	and they ship by the slowest possible option , which will likely take another week .
negative	i will never order from them again and advise others to find a more reliable vendor .
negative	update 0 : it took two_weeks to make it from order to my town , but was dropped_off by fedex at the post_office , so it will take another day or so to arrive at my house .
negative	this is the slowest shipping i '_ve ever_experienced , and is unacceptable .
negative	when parts are shiped they should be what the customer ordered . not something that has to be shpiped back . at my cost . not to mention i was sent 0 pair of foot rail . i didin '_t keep either pair . but was given credit for one pair .
negative	we had a problem with a damaged atv upon delivery .
negative	after over a dozen emails and phone_calls we had little to no response .
negative	after nearly a month of attempts we had to turn the claim over to our credit_card company .
negative	we told this to killer_motorsports and they responded ( good now it will take you months to get your money instead of weeks ) very professional , don_'_t you think .
negative	i ordered a part that clearly said it was the right side but when i got it it was for the left_side .
negative	i ended_up being so pissed_off that i slammed the part right_away and threw it away , i wasnt going to be wasting time on shipping it back nd also paying for the shipping .
negative	i made 0 orders in hd on 00 / 00 / 00 with a value of $_00 ( bogo universal creatine 000 g ) and another worth $_00 ( 0 .
negative	dymatize bcaa complex and mr 000 cap ) as you can see has a good time about 000 days and it has not even received a letter from taxation ( note_: correct address ).
negative	you guys really sent orders ?
negative	request one : 000000000
negative	request two : 000000000
negative	what do happened to my orders ?
negative	fiz dois pedidos em hd em 00 / 00 / 00 com um valor de us $_00 ( bogo creatina universal 000 g ) e outro de us $_00 ( 0 .
negative	dymatize bcaa complex e mr cap 000 ), como você pode ver tem um bom tempo sobre 000 dias e nem se sequer recebi uma carta de tributação ( nota : o endereço correto ).
negative	vocês realmente enviaram minhas encomendas ?
negative	pedido de um : 000000000
negative	pedido dois : 000000000
negative	o_que aconteceu com as minhas encomendas ?
negative	brazil !
negative	please save_yourself some time and frustration order parts from a company that has a customer service number .
negative	take them off your fav '_s for they will not respond to questions until you send scathing e_-_mails .
negative	save the frustration all these are signs of a company with something to hide !!!!!
negative	run !!
negative	!
negative	i ordered two upper_control_arms , both were bent and the bushings were pressed in too far to try and compensate for the poor design .
negative	i should have spent a few extra bucks to get a quality product , these are not much_better then the worn ones with 00 years wear on them .
negative	parts sent were the wrong ones and caused $_000 damage to my vehicle .
negative	when i called the 000 number on what i had thought was the baymont inn and suites webpage i initially got the impression that it had taken me to the corporate reservation center when the call was answered .
negative	i told the agent that i had thought i was calling the inn directly and asked for the direct phone_number for the baymont inn and suites , harrington .
negative	the agent then told me that it wouldn_'_t matter .
negative	if i were to call the inn '_s direct number my call would automatically be transferred to the same call_center that i was talking to .
negative	that being said i continued the reservation process with that agent .
negative	only after having received an_email from reservation_counter confirming my reservation and another from my credit_card company informing_me of a charge from yet another_vendor did i realized that i had been lied to and manipulated .
negative	to make it even more interesting , when i arrived at the baymont inn and suites the desk_clerk said " oh , you booked thru expedia ".
negative	well , after telling him i hadn_'_t booked thru expedia showing him the above mentioned emails on my smart phone we entered into a long conversation about my reservation process and both realized that the entire_process was misleading and unethical .
negative	i reserved a car for 0 days with thrifty through travelocity .
negative	i was charged fa weekly rental fee , which was not that out of the ordinary for auto rental_companies .
negative	because of an impending ice and snow_storm , airlines were calling passengers booked for the day of the storm to reschedule to the day before .
negative	so i returned the car after 0 days .
negative	not only was i charged for the week , i was charged a $_00 " early return " fee .
negative	i was not charged for the 0 days i used the car and then charged a fee , i was charged for the entire week and also an early return fee !
negative	both thrifty and travelocity say too bad , they can charge whatever they want and there '_s nothing i can do about it .
negative	$_00 for doing the same thing they do any time a car is returned ?
negative	which is parking it less_than 00 feet away without cleaning outside or inside -- the car was filthy on the outside and there were candy wrappers and other trash on the inside .
negative	travelocity defends thrifty because obviously they make money from each transaction .
negative	why would i ever want to do_business with either of these companies again , since they rip_off their customers without blinking an eye ?
negative	asking travelocity for assistance in anything is a complete_waste of time .
negative	what " service " are they actually giving ?
negative	i ordered mothers_day flowers a good few_days before mothers_day and chose a delivery day of the 00th_march ( because your site didn_'_t have the 00th as an option ), however on phoning my mother on mothers_day ( i live in australia ), nothing had been received .
negative	i double_checked the confirmation_email , which said delivery would be on the 00th , emailed to find out where the order was ( which you have still not replied to ), and had to get a family_member to pick_up flowers for me on the day as i live_abroad .
negative	so i have had two buy two_sets of flowers because you could not deliver on time and now i am out of pocket - would appreciate to know how you can compensate me ?
negative	?
negative	i was quoted a total price for all the goods i purchased and the manager told me that was the final price but when i checked out he charged me more than quoted i assumed it was higher because i ordered shipping as well but when i got my reciept the shipping was not yet paid .
negative	they wnded up charging me around $_00 dollars more than was quoted .
negative	got a code that did not work .
negative	when working with support they replied quickly but all they told me was that is was an issue i had to communicate with riot about .
negative	this seems unfair if i ordered the card from this site that i would still have to work with riot to correct the issue .
negative	never fulfilled an order accurately .
negative	says things are in stock then ships you half of what you ordered .
negative	total disappointment , my last order was my last order - ever .
negative	i made a reservation over the phone but the reservation was not at the hotel when i arrived .
negative	i waited for an_hour and then had to cancel because i couldn_'_t get a room .
negative	this company is a scam
negative	i was charged an_additional_charge for no reason and cannot get in touch with y ' all .
negative	never will order from y ' all again
negative	i contacted parts_geek for them to pick the correct part i needed to fit my vehicle application .
negative	after receiving the part which did not fit , they instructed me to send it back but i had to pay for shipping .
negative	they told me they do not pay for shipping on online orders .
negative	it is impossible to call and talk to anybody to make an order by phone .
negative	return my money and i will have a good review .
negative	this stinks .
negative	very disapointing .
negative	avoid this place .
negative	after the miserable service , slow delivery , etc_., you '_ll be spammed to death .
negative	bookit staff seems great but rumor is book it always puts smoking and non smoking together just for the sale .
negative	its bad when motels say this too .
negative	they don_'_t care cause the motel deals with the customer .
negative	the motel takes the hit and its not fair .
negative	only option is pushed on motel to make things right which is no good .
negative	don_'_t use book it at all !
negative	ordered a headlight for my daughter '_s car ( passenger_side ).
negative	two times in a row they sent me the drivers_side !!
negative	i contacted the company and was advised ( email ) that refund could take up to 00 days .
negative	so now they have over 000_dollars of my money .
negative	i went to another company and got the correct part , go figure !
negative	!
negative	our car was driven away at gatwickin a in a perfect_condition , the vehicle is a 0 seat land_rover discovery , having just travelled approx 000_miles to the airport , it was checked by the " meet &_greet " driver and signed for and driven away , but on return , the vehicle was in a seriously unroadworthy condition , with no concearn from the returning driver who literally vanished as quick as he had arrived , on inspection it was found that the suspension had been severly damaged , leaving it legally undrivable .
negative	so with 0 adults and 0 young_children we were left stranded at_gatwick airport , when we rang the company we were told there was nobody available , and messages would be left for the directors , but dispite several more phone_calls nothing has_been forthcoming from the " sky_park secure " office or directors , they haven_'_t even had the decency to ring back .
negative	so after having to pay out an initial £_000 . 00 to get the vehicle home , we will have to wait for the additional repair bill from the land_rover garage where it is booked into this week to have the suspention put right .
negative	this may well be a convenient service if all goes well , but " be warned " !!!!
negative	!
negative	after receiving a bad part .
negative	there is no way to have it replaced .
negative	you have to pay for another part plus shipping again .
negative	also you have to pay to ship it back .
negative	this is the only company that i know of that has no replacement policy in place .
negative	here is a copy of there statement ."
negative	i '_m sorry , but we do not have an exchange program in place at the present time .
negative	we will arrange for a prepaid call_tag to be emailed to return the parts .
negative	you will receive this call_tag in 0 - 0 business days ."
negative	this so called call_tag was never sent .
negative	i have no choice but to put a stop payment on my credit_card .
negative	do not use parts_geek for anything ...
negative	do not use bookbyte if you actually need your books ; they will only waste your time .
negative	bookbyte will offer a low_cost , accept your order but then fail to fulfill and , even worse , fail to notify you .
negative	so when the shipping dates come and goes , you left with no books after classes begin .
negative	i ordered left and right mirrors for my 0000 s00 chev pickup and recived two left mirrors 0f differnt types .
negative	iordered a left anr right small mirrors
negative	it doesn_'_t matter what time you call them , whether it be 0 : 00 in the morning or 0 : 00 in the afternoon .
negative	you will never be able to get in contact with a real_person if you have even the slightest issue .
negative	basically they do not have a customer_services department that exists or is willing to pick_up the phone to talk .
negative	i ordered the wrong part by_accident and there is absolutely no option to cancel or change the order should you make a mistake .
negative	they make big money off of incorrect orders by posting a 00_% restocking_fee that is pure profit as a result of their lack of overall respect for customers .
negative	i will never under any circumstances do_business with this company again .
negative	i strongly_recommend that you avoid this company by going to amazon . com or another online parts dealer .
negative	after seconds of placing my order realized that i place two order the same and i wanted to change one of the order so i call customer service and customer service said that i had to fill_out a support_ticket and after i filling it out it took about three day for them to e_-_mail back .
negative	e_-_mail stated that once you place a order you cannot change your order ..
negative	i bout rotors and dims that the company said were exact_fit only to find out they were the wrong part , i requested a return and they denied it .
negative	their parts destroyed my brake system costing me 000_dollars in repairs .
negative	now i '_m stuck with rotors and less money in my pocket .
negative	vi køber en fladskærm til 00000kr i elgiganten og fordi_det kun er udstillingsmodellen der_er tilbage kan_vi få_den billigere .
negative	de skal lige gøre den klar og_så_kan_vi hente den , dog 0 time efter lukketid .
negative	vi kører hjem og_vil læse om tvét på_nettet og finder faktisk ud_af at vi kun havde_fået 000kr i rabat end den pris der_er på_nettet , og endda købt udstillingsmodellen / demo modellen .
negative	vi kommer ned og venter i lang_tid_på at den skal komme ud_til os , efter den længde venten kommer den ud iført max 0 lags bobble plast som på_ingen måder er beregnet til at flytte et glas tv i på 00kg .
negative	vi finder hurtigt ud_af at vi_ikke_kan have den i vores egen bil og flytter tvét på elgigantens egen vogn over på_den_anden side af elgiganten hvor vi ringer efter_en bekendt der køre os hjem med_det .
negative	da_vi kommer hjem med tvét og_vil pakke det_ud opdager vi at der_er_en kæmpe revne hele_vejen igennem tvét .
negative	vi tager nu ned til elgiganten , og_har pakket tvét ned i en_anden kasse så_det i hvert_fald ikke går mere i stykker ...
negative	der_skal vi så igen vente ca 0 time før der_kommer en der_kan hjælpe os .
negative	vi fortæller om hvordan vi_har fragtet det meget forsigtigt hjem , og pakker det_ud og opdager revnen , han afviser blankt at det_kan væres deres fejl , og hidser sig rimelig meget op , som_om_det_er vores fejl .
negative	det_er dem_der_har udlevere en demo model og pakket det let ind i bobble plast .
negative	så nu kører sagen videre til forbrugerklage nævnet !!!!!!!
negative	!
negative	twice i have used dpd .. one was to deliver leaflets , ( this was dpds ).
negative	the leaflets were never delivered leaving me £_000 down .
negative	the next time was not my choice but someone sending me an item from ebay .
negative	they said they delivered it to a different address , and later i found that to be untrue .
negative	a pitiful excuse for a company , really quite angry
negative	not very good service and difficult to do_business with .
negative	i wanted to change the date or my stay from 0 nights to 0 nights and they couldn_'_t make the change .
negative	the support rep said that there was no availability .
negative	i wasn_'_t adding a night , i was reducing by one night .
negative	that should be an easy change .
negative	i ended_up cancelling the reservation and still have not received a notification about my refund .
negative	i also don_'_t like that they bill all nights in advance .
negative	i cancelled and booked directly with the hotel .
negative	much_easier .
negative	delays with processing my order - lenses were not received - was given excuses about problems with their suppliers - eventually after 0_weeks and no lenses i cancelled the order and got a full_refund ( full_refund was only issued after i threatened legal_action as they would only offer partial_refund ) however they eventually refunded the total payment i made after i quoted the sale of goods act and distance_selling regulations - overall a very poor customer experience and one i wont repeat
negative	this is possibly the worst company i have ever_dealt_with .
negative	they send you a notice that in 00 - 00_hrs they will address ( 00_hours ???)
negative	send you to different websites within their website to respond to your ques or ask you a question then have you linked elsewhere .
negative	clueless company , no humans , no parts , cancelled order have yet heard back .
negative	if you order there is no way to contact the company to cancel or change an order .
negative	their phone_number will always route to a voicemail , the chat line is never available ( the representatives are supposedly offline ), and there aren_'_t any email_addresses to correspond with .
negative	the help section is their own notification or email system , but you do not get a copy nor do you get a response .
negative	i did receive a text_message after leaving several voicemails ( only because the charge had not gone though at the time ) that noted a number to call , but it has_been " temporarily disabled " - call it yourself 000 - 000 - 0000 .
negative	in researching the company , there are numerous complaints .
negative	their promise of processing is deceptive .
negative	they did charge my account , but have not provided any merchandise .
negative	others have similar claims , while some stated they have not received a refund after sending the product back , and the the phones have been defective .
negative	my guess is that those_who have these " great " reviews are the owners .
negative	please , do yourself a favor and google it before buying .
negative	they made a mistake and sent me a pair of rotors , one that was correct and the other that '_s clearly wrong .
negative	they will not pay return shipping for their error and the shop doing the work has to be paid twice .
negative	do not depend_on parts_geek and pay_attention to the fine_print that harms you and protects them .
negative	like it was stated_above , you can '_t rate something you didn_'_t receive .
negative	i would not do_business with northshore_care supply again .
negative	i received the package on schedule , unfortunately , the wrong item was in the package .
negative	ordered a door hande , and received a box of quick connectors in a door_handle box ..
negative	they send the wrong item after it took 0 days to deliver .
negative	jeg_bestilte_en gul regnfrække i medium , men de sendte mig i xxxl .
negative	hvilket jo er aaaalt for stor .
negative	og da_jeg_vil ha den byttet svare de_ikke på_min mail ....
negative	uselt !!
negative	!
negative	i will never use parts_geek again !
negative	i ordered parts from the which they said they had in stock , they didn_'_t have them as claimed !
negative	they tied_up over $_000 .
negative	for 00 days before returning it to me .
negative	they absolutely suck ...,
negative	i was hoping to pay less .
negative	i ended_up paying way over budget .
negative	order number : 0000000
negative	the prices are not the bad part , it '_s the web_site description of products .
negative	you purchase a 0in core width radiator and you actually get a 0 / 0 core radiator that has to endure 000 + degree temp .
negative	you tell the business your unhappy with the product and if you can return it due to them not properly describing the product .
negative	the business respond by basically saying : we shipped the item you ordered , your stuck with it , if you want to return it , pay shipping & 00_% restocking_fee .
negative	plus , don_'_t expect your money within a couple of days , wait at_least 00 days .
negative	their policy sucks cock !
negative	!
negative	i recently went to apply for a personal loan with my wife , and together we have great income , and i only have student debt .
negative	new debt .
negative	everything else on my end paid off .
negative	she only has a few things that are low payments , and on time ... experion score listed here is almost 000 points more than my actual score .
negative	in other_words they ' re scoring system is f *%^ ed up !!!
negative	i can understand up to a 00 point difference , but 000 point difference !!!
negative	my score is way way lower_than they said .
negative	this is unacceptable !!
negative	now i wonder_if my other two scores are even accurate .
negative	not impressed with the service i have received might change my opinion if the problem is fixed .
negative	didn_'_t have a good experience they really need to take the time to pack the items better
negative	i found my desired itinerary however when i went to purchase it , i was told its not available for some reason .
negative	okay , i will look for another itinerary .
negative	then i found the exact itinerary i originally preferred for a few_bucks more .
negative	okay , i will pay a few_bucks more .
negative	when i went to purchase it , again i was told it is not available for some reason .
negative	okay , i will look for another itinerary .
negative	then again , i found the exact_same itinerary i originally wanted , this time for even more money .
negative	at this point , i knew , the original price was a lost leader to make it appear that travelocity had the lowest fares when in fact they didn_'_t .
negative	i will never book with travelocity again .
negative	i spent the extra money on the travel_insurance which was supposed to protect me if i wanted to change flights or had an_emergency come up ... which it did .
negative	i am a diabetic and went into insulin shock on my way to the airport and ended_up missing my flight .
negative	when my daughter called to let someone / anyone know all she got was the runaround and passed from one department to another .
negative	it is a total scam and definitely not worth the extra money .
negative	if you miss your flight or need to change you cannot just simply make the change , even four hours ahead of the flight as my daughter tried to do for me when i went into shock .
negative	you have to purchase a brand_new ticket , then fill_out endless paperwork , and then " hope " you get some sort of refund , which almost a month later , i still have not received notification on .
negative	it is so disheartening to be taken_advantage of when i gladly paid the extra fee for the insurance considering my age and medical issues ... all to simply visit my children and grandchildren .
negative	yes , you don_'_t pay now , but you may pay a lot more later .
negative	you give all the personal information you would provide equifax .
negative	their terms of use explain that they will keep your info " in perpetuity " i . e .. forever .
negative	they reserve the right to sell the company and all your data at any time to the highest bidder .
negative	( see russian mafia & nigeria ) this is an open invitation to identity_theft on a massive scale .
negative	they do not deny this , but just say the data is kept on " secure servers " ( see target and snowden at nsa ) there is no such thing as a secure server especially one run out of a back room on sansone st . in san_francisco with 00 employees and 0 million in sales last_year , all profit after salaries goes to those hundreds of commercials .
negative	plus they do their best to " upsell " you constantly .
negative	beware of this company if you value your personal information .
negative	i have shopped at rockauto for years and then i noticed partsgeek had better prices .
negative	well let_me tell you .... you get what you pay for .
negative	their part descriptions and applications are horrilbe .
negative	also their 00_% restocking_fee for returns is a joke .
negative	their customer service in general is ridiculous .
negative	it is impossible to call them .... no number found .
negative	i '_m going back to rockauto and will never shop at partsgeek again .
negative	first -- you need to hire someone to answer the phone and then up date and correct your parts listing . this is my last order -- tired of getting the wrong and having to pay freight back when you are at fault .
negative	my tickets were issued and the fees were charged to my account , so i didn_'_t worried_about it .
negative	all the sudden , my reservation was cancelled , i didn_'_t get any email from the company .
negative	they never reimbursed me the fees .
negative	i am formally working on a complaint to the better business_bureau .
negative	i really hope they get serious about their " business " - scam .
negative	i am extremely disappointed .

negative	i order some light_bulbs .
negative	specifically auto lamp 00 .
negative	they are small and the item shown via photo looked exactly_what i was looking for !
negative	the package showed 0 bulbs in a pack so i order 0 packages of 0 bulbs .
negative	the numbers were on the order for the parts i needed , the pictures were good , price seemed fair .
negative	i waited a day and thinking i should have check the reviews on the company before i purchased i ran a google on " partsgeek ".
negative	i could not find a satisfied customer .
negative	the most common problem being not getting what was ordered .
negative	well , they were right .
negative	the order was wrong !
negative	on top of that they do not pay for return shipping , they are slow in sending rma '_s and they offer refunds rather_than just sending the correct part .
negative	there does not seem to be an easy way to contact them .
negative	and they do not answer_questions other than wrote emails with no return address .
negative	i don_'_t do_business with scam_artists .
negative	they got my money and they wasted my time .
negative	i won_'_t be back .
negative	well they failed my car cause of low tread height in my passenger_side_rear tire .
negative	the ass technician open my door on the car and dented my door , on the post for the car lift and played dumb like it wasn_'_t him .
negative	even_though they caught him on camera .
negative	then they wanted to sell me tires for my car for $_000 a tire when the screen said $_000 and the guy said it '_s the $_00 difference is a shipping fee so they could ship there own tire from one facility to theres .
negative	wtf ???
negative	so in total the charged me $_000 . 00 to give me a hard time and dent my door .
negative	pricing was good , way too many cross sell offers during check out
negative	i placed order thinking it was coming by ground .
negative	it came by usps which does not deliver to my address .
negative	i then opened up a service request and got no response .
negative	so_far no part and no response .
negative	it '_s funny that i should get this email about how much you care about your customer '_s experience , considering that after i received my order , i sent you an_email_stating how pathetic the plants were , and received absolutely no response .
negative	i worked for years in customer service , and if i learned one thing is that lack of communication from a vendor to its customer is by_far worse than flawed merchandise !
negative	your lack of response shows what kind of company i am dealing_with here .
negative	prove me wrong !

negative	i ordered a book on jan . 00 and has not come ( now march 00 ).
negative	stick with amazon - you might be paying a few more bucks , but at_least you '_ll get your book ... instead of nothing , and lose your money .
negative	yep - no refund .
negative	their customer service is an_automated_response bot .
negative	totally sketchy .
negative	i plan on following up with an investigation through paypal .
negative	dualj - i will be harassing you until i get my money back .
negative	count on it .
negative	these_people do not answer the phone and they take_forever to reply to emails .... stay_away !!
negative	!
negative	i bought quick struts for my focus .
negative	i received them and they didn_'_t match but that isn_'_t the worst part .
negative	the parts are missing_pieces and not assembled correctly .
negative	worst place to buy auto_parts .
negative	there was no chance to rate at less_than one star .
negative	the representative wasn_'_t rude , so that doesn_'_t come into play .
negative	the price quoted was higher_than i could have gotten for myself online .
negative	since i was looking for nine ( 0 ) rooms for relatives to attend a family funeral , i thought perhaps i could use that for a bit of purchasing power .
negative	at first the computer was ' down '.
negative	next , i received to confirmations at an unacceptable price .
negative	after 00_minutes , i just said that i was not interested and to please cancel all that had been done .
negative	i was transferred to ' customer service ' where i spent anothe 00_minutes trying to negate anything that had been done .
negative	i would hear from cust svc within 0 hours with a full cancellation email .
negative	after 0 hours i called cust svc back and , after 00_minutes on the phone , got the cancellation email .
negative	i do not accept your " terms and conditions " but had to check the box to post this review .
negative	i bought a few parts and they were fine then i inquired_about getting a better description on a set wheels and they were not helpful .
negative	they told me to refer to the catalog and i explained to them that the listing was not clear on the color of the wheels and the finish . the picture of the wheels in the online sight was a black and white unclear drawing .
negative	i didn_'_t want to order the wheels and not be happy with them and be charged shipping and a restocking_fee .
negative	after 0 or 0 emails to customer service ...............................
negative	i still_haven_'_t got an answer on what the wheels really look like .
negative	can you please help me here is the part number if you look it it up you will see what i mean

negative	i ordered a starter for my vehicle with 000_% accuracy from me .
negative	partsgeek sent wrong part ( starter ), now , i have to pay to return it !!!!
negative	what poor customer service .
negative	i do a lot of internet shopping and this has to be one of the worse policies ever .
negative	they need to change it .
negative	i will be posting my poor experience with partsgeek on all the social networks and consumer opinion websites .
negative	also the shipping box was 0 to 00 times bigger than it needed to be ?
negative	lee rittel
negative	my order has not been delivered , i requested confirmation of the actual ship date and have had no response what so ever .
negative	they '_ve had no issue with taking my money though .
negative	spare_tire hoist won_'_t work on my 0000hd truck even_though web_site said it would .
negative	the bracket that holds the rim is to small .
negative	the spare_tire will fall off if i used it .
negative	now i will have to pay a 00_% restocking_charge and pay to send part back .
negative	i should have went to gm parts direct same price for gm part .
negative	my mistake .
negative	and it took over a week to get the wrong part .
negative	unfortunately , the screen i received did not match my laptop .
negative	it was incorrectly labeled on their website , or i was simply sent the wrong item and i can no_longer return it because the 00 day return period has run it '_s course .
negative	i would_happily change my rating if they allowed_me to exchange the screen for the correct model .
negative	what am i supposed to do with it now ?
negative	plus i '_m out $_000 .
negative	well i got the package opened it there was the crank pulley along with the woodruff key but no bolt as said in the description and shown in the image .
negative	really disappointed since i ordered this pulley because i needed the bolt as well .
negative	tried to call customer service and no answer .
negative	i called several_times automatic message answered with a couple of options and when you chose to stay on the line it automatically ends the phone_call .
negative	worst service ever yeah i may have got the main part but everything listed in the description should have been in the box .
negative	point blank no screw ups !
negative	plus it '_s horrible that i couldn_'_t get a hold of anyone to fix this problem !
negative	order 0 items have received 0 items no_idea about other items or if i am being refunded for what i didn_'_t get
negative	i recently submitted a nokia n0 which you quoted 00 + pounds for .
negative	a couple of days_later you reduced the offer to 00 + pounds saying that the phone had a fault so i had it returned only to find said phone in pristeen condition .
negative	i do not think this is a good way to do_business and will never use you again and advise my friends to do the same .
negative	you shouldn_'_t have asked .
negative	will never use the company again .
negative	they suck
negative	i would put negative stars if i could !!
negative	i have a problem with the shipping_charges and when i call an_automated machine tells_me to fill_out a ticket online then disconnects the call .
negative	when i fill_out the ticket online ( literally over 00 times now ) it will not recognize the captcha so it won_'_t submit the ticket .
negative	long_story short , there is no customer service !!
negative	will be disputing the full_amount with my card company since nobody_wants to talk to me .
negative	i write to support 0 times , and never have a reply from support .
negative	they sell a psn_card euro that don_'_t work and when i write for asking
negative	about this , sending also screen shoot of ps0 they never reply to my mail
negative	bad service , or better to say nothing service .
negative	don_'_t kidding me , i write to your support 0 times , like i write before , and you never reply , just now after read bad review .
negative	and all 0 times i send screen_shot for proof that your code card was invalid or not more valid .
negative	i sended new mail again now , must see if you resolve .
negative	ordered an item , paid_extra for named day delivery , did not arrive on that day , after many phone_calls promised to deliver the following week , did not arrive , eventually turned_up two and a half weeks after ordering , sent complaint via_email , only received an_automated reply , sent second email did not receive anything .
negative	customer service absolutely shambolic , whenever you call they will always be experiencing higher_than average call_volumes , prepare to wait a long time , when you do get through no one seems able to resolve anything .
negative	if you do decide to use this company ( i never will again )
negative	prepare for the worst service that you have ever_experienced and you won_'_t be disappointed .
negative	my product was shipped to the wrong location and i was unable to contact any person whatsoever .
negative	i was placed on hold for more than 00_minutes .
negative	without even asking me instead of just sending me the part correctly they refunded my money less the shipping even_though it was their mistake .
negative	all i wanted was my headlight and i could not even get through to a customer service representative to get that .
negative	i will take my business elsewhere from now on .
negative	i had been waiting on my headlight for more than a week .
negative	had i known that had been the case i would have ordered elsewhere .
negative	i was shocked to discover that i was billed in full for a reservation at the time i placed it .
negative	i thought i was simply making a reservation , and my credit_card was required to hold the reservation .
negative	i wont be using this company again , after sending my phone for repair and stating what the issue was they sent it back fixing one of the issues . the main problem was the speaker was faulty but they didn_'_t fix that so the main purpose of the phone was unusable . this issue has taken nearly 0 months and now the phone cant be fixed .
negative	they have lied about deliveries , cant refund by paypal but they can take payment by paypal , say they will pay for delivery costs which i have now had 0 of , but delivery has taken that long proof of purchase has_gone missing .
negative	don_'_t have a good word to say about my trendy phone , sorry i dealt_with them to begin with .
negative	spent $_000 on a tree and 00 days_later , i still don_'_t have it .
negative	i am not happy .
negative	my order was sent out by milletts , and i was given a tracking_number .
negative	every day it had supposedly been sent out for delivery , then said various reasons_why it had not been delivered .
negative	after a whole page and 0_weeks waiting i had to contact milletts myself , since they had not contacted me .
negative	initially they said the courier had not been able to find the address ( maybe they could have tried phoning me !
negative	), they then said it would be delivered the following_day and that they would phone when near to get details of how to locate the house .
negative	they never arrived , 0 emails later , the excuse was the parcel ( measuring under 0 foot cubed ) was too big for the van .
negative	a further 0 days passed then milletts agreed to send the parcel with a different courier .
negative	both the old and new deliveries then arrived within hours of each other , now i have to send the second one back again ( they are arranging the courier , but i still have to be in to hand it over ).
negative	what a mess !!
negative	!
negative	first ; you sent and charged me for two orders then i had to pay
negative	$_00 . 00 to return them . when the parts were received the radiator support was broken ($_000 . 00 ) and you expect me to pay again to return it .
negative	( again not my fault ).
negative	i am now out $_000 . 00 and do not have the parts i need .
negative	charged my card knowing they didnt hold stock even_though website reported they did .
negative	failed to deliver for partners birthday .
negative	received custom board with discolored deck and am told it is my problem .
negative	sent hi - res photo per their request and there is no_recourse as it is a custom board .
negative	i obviously discolored the deck in 00 spots by opening the box .
negative	guess i need to stop payment thru the credit_card to get their attention .
negative	pretty poor response .
negative	have had good experiences on almost all internet puchases as long as it is from a reputable_company .
negative	a !
negative	isn_'_t one of them .
negative	a0 should get a d -.
negative	the replacement part order was not the same as what was needed .
negative	i was able to make it work however the poor rating is the lack in the ability to speak with a professional / anyone for that matter .
negative	i replaced the part and hope that my fear of it not being correct doesn_'_t come to a head .
negative	poor customer a service .
negative	shortly_after i placed my third order to selectspecs on feb 0th , 0000 , i decided to change the order .
negative	i tried to contact you by email on your website .
negative	your website would not take my message .
negative	check your website to see why messages cannot be sent .
negative	finally , i placed my fourth order (# 000000 ) on march_00th , 0000 .
negative	this is the order i wanted to receive instead of the third order .
negative	never ever use the geek tech toolbox
negative	on the website it only mentions about a £_00 minimum order charge .
negative	after i placed my order ( which had to be over £_00 for the system to allow it ), they then messaged me back some days_later to inform_me that the minimum charge for my order has_been put up to £_00 instead .
negative	doesn_'_t say anywhere about £_00 .
negative	just a scam site .
negative	be_careful before you pay .
negative	i didn_'_t receive my order so no birthday_present my my daughter , unacceptable , won_'_t risk buying ever again .
negative	got a refund but that '_s no good as a birthday_present .
negative	it took over two_weeks for them to offer me my refund and come to think of it the money is not back in my bank_account yet .
negative	i tried using travelocity on several_occasions as i was considering using them for all of my corporate travel .
negative	well - that '_s certainly not going to happen .
negative	i had a trip and had to make a last_minute change to the ticket .
negative	my complete inability to speak with anyone led me to booking a new ticket rather_than making a change and being charge a ridiculous $_00 booking_fee on a ticket i could have booked online had i had access to the internet ( i was in asia ).
negative	they also failed to include my ff number when they booked the ticket which has now caused me to have to contact the airlines directly and send all_sorts of back up to them to try to get credit .
negative	i have sent 0 urgent customer service requests to travelocity all of which are automatically responded to and i am told that a human would contact me shortly to resolve my issue .
negative	i have never ever been contacted by anyone once .
negative	travelocity is simply terrible .
negative	i will never use them again , have asked my employees not to use them and encourage_anyone_who will listen not to use them .
negative	first & foremost , read the small_print .
negative	if you are doing a top_notch repair , buy only capa certified parts .
negative	if told that platinum or any other high_quality named rating is used , expect to form your repair to fit the part .
negative	order placed 0 / 00 / 0000 & buyer pays postage .
negative	postage paid by buyer returned part received @ parts_geek return warehouse 0 / 0 / 0000 .
negative	buyer hounds parts_geek for refund after their 00 day required time to reimburse funds .
negative	notified 0 / 0 / 0000 that refund coming minus a 00_% restocking_fee .
negative	0 / 0 / 0000 & i still_haven_'_t been reimbursed .
negative	beware .
negative	they took my money for order over 0 days ago , the post_office still shows that they have not received the order for shipment .
negative	i am very upset about the whole thing and wish i would have ordered from another store .
negative	they shipped wrong part .
negative	no rep to talk with and 0 - 0 days for a return receipt .
negative	no time frame on new part getting shipped .
negative	very poor process and no way to get answers from a person .
negative	poor communication , late reply to mail .
negative	sends the wrong products , wrong number .
negative	does not recognize the error and does not compensate with something .
negative	i have had very bad impression of the company .
negative	waited ages and it never arrived .
negative	took 0_weeks just to get my refund after waiting 0_weeks for the order and giving up !
negative	i have yet to receive an intelligent answer as to when i will receive my order .
negative	very soon , i am going to have to cancel
negative	bought cv_axles for a honda_civic .
negative	they weren_'_t much_cheaper_than the local parts store .
negative	but i didn_'_t need the car fixed right_away .
negative	so i thought i would save a couple bucks .
negative	i ordered parts and when they got to me they were the wrong ones .
negative	two different part numbers on the box .
negative	you would think someone would catch this ...
negative	so i call to get a return package slip .
negative	i wait on the phone for 00_minutes and then their automated service tells you to call another time , then_hangs_up on you .
negative	no option to talk to someone .
negative	so i email ... at this time i have already bought the right parts from local store and fixed vehicle .
negative	a couple days_later i get a rma_number to return .
negative	i go to return and it cost me 00 dollars !!
negative	i read on their returns no pay to return !!!
negative	you will pay for thier mistakes !!!
negative	not worth the hassle !
negative	in the end i am out 00 bucks for 000_dollars of parts .
negative	joke !
negative	will never buy from parts_geeks again !
negative	and i will tell_everyone i know !
negative	in the end they lose ....
negative	the dosage was covered by superfluous tape to obfuscate the dosage .
negative	i will probably not order from this company again .
negative	misleading label .
negative	horrible experience .
negative	order cancelled with no warning .
negative	customer service only available m - f called credit_card company , to get info that merchant cancelled the order .
negative	costing ma alot of money !!!
negative	!..... i spending to much money calling to my country ... i spent 000_dollars for load just only 0 days and every time i make a phone_call to my country ...
negative	eating up your minutes ...... and the international rate is ridiculous !!
negative	! beware this company ' don_'_t waste your time to get this service !!..
negative	i should believe and listen to my friend and other people ... said ' you '_ll regret ....' anyway , im done !
negative	!..... i will not recommend this service to my friend relative or people !!
negative	!.... i dont feel sorry .....
negative	my father in - law had recently taken very ill and hospitalized due to a lung infection , he was placed in intensive care .
negative	i had taken out my policy just prior to him getting ill , only just though .
negative	when i explained to the the agent at multitrip my situation , she interrogated me asking if i had taken the policy out after he was taken ill ... she basically and coldly told me we wouldn_'_t be covered if medical records prove this to be the case , and ' we will do everything in our power to check records ' ...
negative	it was one of the most stressful holidays we ever had , wondering_if my wife '_s father would pull through while concerned if we would be covered or not .
negative	( you hear stories of insurance companies going through every measure possible trying not to make a payment )
negative	she asked me why i didn_'_t take out the policy upon booking , i explained i preferred to take out an annual_policy closer to my time of travel to get the full complement of the year .
negative	again i was told we were not assured payment .
negative	ultimately we went on the holiday to america , one of the worst experiences one has to go through not knowing if a family_member is going to pull through , and possibly not a hope of a refund of monies spent .
negative	i work for an embassy and always recommend multitrip to the many visa applicants who visit .
negative	this will not be the case from now on , i will do my best to dissuade any future business both professionally and personally from this heartless company .
negative	graham
negative	you are on hold for 00_mins every time you cal and i am still_waiting for delivery 0 days_later !
negative	the staff seem very uninterested and don_'_t seem to know where my order is when i call .
negative	i wouldn_'_t recommend them to anyone .
negative	awful !
negative	opdatering 00 - 00 - 0000
negative	fra 00 juni - " set i lyset af sådan som tingene har udviklet sig , kan_vi_ikke overskue at sætte ny behandling i gang , men vi afslutter selvfølgelig igangværende behandling ( cementering af krone hos xxxxxx d . 00 . 00 . 0000 )"
negative	så nej , grevetand , i ønskede kun at fortsætte den behandling og hos den tandlæge jeg_har klaget over og som_jeg_har bedt udført af_en_anden .
negative	det_er da glædeligt i nu også ønsker at færdiggøre de andre behandlinger og_jeg tager kontakt_til jer i næste uge .
negative	og iøvrigt handler mine spørgsmål om garantier ikke om prisoverslag , men garanti om udført arbejde .
negative	at det også_er_et ordentligt stykke arbejde , set i lyset af_en midlertidig krone falder af 0 gange .
negative	opdatering 00 - 00 - 0000 :
negative	grevetand har_nu aflyst alle aftaler i forhold_til_det tandarbejde der skulle udføres .
negative	sidder nu med_en blottet tand uden krone
negative	tror nogle blev sure over at modtage en anmeldelse af deres arbejde og at jeg bad om at få_en_anden tandlæge hos_dem til at udføre kronearbejdet istedet for den tandlæge jeg_har klaget over .
negative	så må grevetand jo tage denne med advokater / tandlægeforening / patientklagenævn .
negative	---------------------------------------------------------------
negative	efter_en årrække væk_fra tandlæger , grundet dårlige oplevelse og tandlægeskræk tager jeg kontakt_til grevetand ( greve ) for at få ryddet op og_få_et ordentligt smil igen .
negative	vi gennemgår alt der_skal laves og_alt lyder flot .
negative	smil , løfter , garantier i massevis og går derfra med håb om endeligt en tandlæge der_kan levere et_godt stykke arbejde , samt en smule mindre tandlægeskræk .
negative	som_det gamle ordsprog siger : når noget lyder for godt til at være sandt , så_er_det det som_regel heller_ikke .
negative	første dårlige oplevelse , var_en undersøgelse , hvor tandlægen skal bruge lidt råd og vejledning fra anden tandlæge .
negative	ind kommer tandlæge to og inden jeg_har_fået set mig_om har_jeg munden fuld af tandlæge to '_s instrumenter .
negative	hvem tandlæge to var , aner jeg_ikke for vedkommende syntes åbenbart ikke man skulle præsentere sig inden man stak fingrene i munden på kunden .
negative	der_skal laves en_del og en_af tingene er_en gammel krone som_er ekstremt dårligt lavet af min gamle tandlæge .
negative	kronen bliver hevet af og en midlertidig bliver sat på .
negative	eller jeg_skal måske nærmere sige at det_var meningen den skulle blive sat på .
negative	den røg hurtigt af og_jeg måtte tage fri fra arbejde for at få_den sat på .
negative	tabt arbejdsfortjeneste fordi tandlægen ikke_kunne_finde_ud_af sit arbejde .
negative	den bliver sat på igen , nu med stærkere lim .
negative	farvel og tak ...
negative	da_jeg_kommer hjem syntes jeg godt nok tanden er temmelig følsom , så_jeg tager en kigger på tanden .
negative	her sidder den midlertidige krone og gaber , så der_er frit ind_til resterne af min_egen tand .
negative	jeg tænker , har snart en tid hos tandlægen så_jeg nævner det for dem_der .
negative	et_par dage går og søndag aften , sidder jeg igen pludseligt med_den midlertidige krone i hånden .
negative	sender_en klage , hvori jeg selvfølgeligt får den sædvanlige smøre om at de er kede af forløbet og de kan tilbyde mig en_ny tid .
negative	citat fra klagesvar : " den midlertidige krone er blot noget midlertidigt , hvorfor det til tider er naturligt at den ikke holder .
negative	du skal ikke være nervøs for den_rigtige krone ."
negative	hold op en infantil bortforklaring .
negative	hvor dumme tror i folk er ?
negative	tag dog et ansvar .
negative	og nej det_er_ikke den_rigtige krone jeg_er bange for .........
negative	man_kan sende folk til månen og bygge højhuse der_ikke falder sammen , men sætte_en midlertidig krone på der bliver siddende , kan grevetand absolut ikke_finde_ud_af .
negative	og de kalder sig endda for tandlæger og_har masser_af flotte diplomer hængende .
negative	hvor mange_gange mener grevetand at jeg_skal have ekstraudgifter for et stykke arbejde der skulle have været udført første_gang ?
negative	hvilken garanti mener grevetand at de nu vil give mig for at den sidder fast denne gang ?
negative	hvilken garanti mener grevetand de kan give i forhold_til resten af de aftaler jeg_har med_dem ?
negative	måske grevetand kan fortælle mig hvordan man_kan have tillid til_en tandlæge som_ikke_kan udføre et simpelt stykke tandarbejde eller kan tage ansvar ?
negative	kan_ikke anbefale grevetand ( greve )
negative	sidste år købte vi en kia , hos andersen & martini på amager .
negative	der_var lidt kludder med leveringen , men vi tænkte , sådanne ting kan ske .
negative	vi_var glade for vores nye bil og_det_hele så fint ud .
negative	på_et tidspunkt beslutter jeg mig_til at smide nogle bedre højtalere i bilen .
negative	bestiller dem hos amager - afdelingen .
negative	de_får dem hjem , isætter dem_og_jeg kører derfra .
negative	der går et_par dage , hvorefter højtalerne skratter og på_ingen måde er brugbare eller pengene værd .
negative	så_jeg kører på værkstedet og beder dem fixe det samt kigge på_et_par småting jeg_havde bemærket ved bilen .
negative	jeg henter bilen da de meldte at den nu var i ordenen nej , jeg_skulle tage grueligt fejl .
negative	højttalerne skrattede og var lige så ubrugelige som da_jeg afleverede den .
negative	hiver fat i dem_og spørger dem hvordan de kan klarmelde opgaven , når der tydeligt ikke_er lavet noget_som_helst på_den .
negative	de prøver at komme med_den sædvanlige løgn - smøre , hvorefter jeg gør dem klart at de er taget i at snyde og de bare skal fixe det prompte .
negative	jeg_kommer så igennem den helt store vip - tur , får undskyldninger og topmodel som lånebil imens , i håbet om at redde den på_den måde .
negative	jeg_håber de_har lært at man_ikke skal snyde mig_og opføre sig pænt .
negative	lige indtil igår hvor_jeg_så skal igennem endnu en skidt oplevelse med samme sted .
negative	jeg modtager d 00 - 0 - 00 en betalingspåmindelse , der_var dateret den 00 - 0 - 00 , men_der_var_ikke skrevet på hvad_jeg_skulle betale for og betaling skulle ske inden 0 dage fra 00 - 0 - 00 .
negative	ikke meget tid at reagere på og_jeg betaler altså ikke for noget jeg_ikke ved hvad er .
negative	så_jeg skriver naturligtvis til_dem_og spørger .
negative	jeg_får et_svar om at der_er for hjulskifte .
negative	det_er jeg lidt uforstående overfor , da_jeg mener jeg betalte for dette tidligere på måneden sammen_med opbevaring .
negative	skriver tilbage at der_er overført penge den 0 - 0 - 00 .
negative	hertil får_jeg et af de mest nedladen svar jeg længe har set , på mail .
negative	visse ord er skrevet med stort , som_om_jeg_ikke_kan forstå ord der_er skrevet med småt og kommentaren " det_kan også virke lidt forvirrende ."
negative	amager - afdelingen har ingen forståelse for service , kundemindethed og snyder så_det driver af dem .
negative	kan_kun på_det kraftigste advare mod at bruge dem .
negative	so i decided to try out this website , to buy gamecard .
negative	created an account , find the product i want to buy an put in an order .
negative	so_far , so good .
negative	now here is where the " fun " begins .
negative	recieve an ordercomfirmation and soon after i get an_email with the following sentence : " we reviewed your payment details and decided to offer you to go through the id_verification " since this apparently is an offer , i reply no thanks to id_verification .
negative	this was apparently not an offer , as stated , but a requirement , because i promptly receive an_email_stating the need it to progress the order and to counter fraud .
negative	so i sent them a picture that includes a picture of me and my drivers_license .
negative	but again i receive an_email promptly , that now says my picture does not meet all requirements for this procedure .
negative	this just got too silly for me ad i was not going to go through further procedure - crap with this customerservice , so i cancel the order .
negative	it is simply too much hassle for some gamecard that can be bought all over the internet .
negative	i can not recommend gamecards . eu to anyone and you are hereby warned against using this website .
negative	har_haft perspektiv bredbånd i 0 år .
negative	alt startede som sædvanligt godt , men siden har det været_en absolut ustabil og til tider horribel kundeservice_og kundemindedhed .
negative	i mere_end et_år betalte jeg 00 ,-_kr mere for min forbindelse end andre kunder , fordi perspektiv " glemte " at oplyse om at de_havde ændret prisen .
negative	de mente at det_var min_egen opgave at holde øje med dette og bede om at få det ændret .
negative	da_jeg endeligt fik det ændret krævede de at jeg_skulle have en binding på 0 måneder .
negative	her er_det_ikke svært at regne ud at jeg nu begynder at kigge efter andet selskab .
negative	jeg_har så fundet et_nyt teleselskab , som_jeg skifter over til 0 dec . men på_grund af at jeg ryger ind i december måned , grundet teleselskabernes idiotiske regler om opsigelsesfrister og f ...... pumpestok , mener perspektiv at jeg selvfølgeligt også skal_betale for hele december måned .
negative	og_det til trods for at perspektiv lukker min forbindelse d . 0 .
negative	glæder mig usigeligt til at komme væk_fra dette bondefangerselskab og ser frem til et_nyt selskaab og bedre service .
negative	perspektiv er noteret blandt venner , bekendte og familie , som et selskab man_skal gå langt udenom .
negative	kan_kun på_det kraftigste advare mod at bruge dette selskab .
negative	tog kontakt_til arbejdernes landsbank , da_jeg_ikke_er tilfreds_med_min nuværende bank og ser mig_om fter en bank der_kan levere bedre produkter og service .
negative	fik istandsat et møde , som gik godt og lovende .
negative	alt blev gennemgået , løfter blev givet , masser_af smil og_vi gik fra hinanden med_en plan om vores fremtidige aftale .
negative	alle nødvendige papirer blev afleveret ( da banken ikke accepterer pdf - filer på_en usb , vi skriver altså 0000 al ), manglede kun et enkelt papir som_jeg_skulle have fra_min nuværende bank .
negative	da_jeg_fik fremskaffet papiret blev det sendt og bogstaveligt 00 min senere ringer banken og fortæller mig at man_ikke_vil have mig som_kunde .
negative	jeg_har en sund økonomi , et lille boliglån , lidt penge på opsparingen og_har_aldrig misset en regning .
negative	en lav risiko kunde .
negative	hvad skulle alt det møde , papirarbejde , osv til for ?
negative	bankrådgiver gav mig endda en større stak visitkort , som han åbenbart håbede jeg_ville give til venner_og bekendte .
negative	mage til falske løfter , respektløs behandling_af potentielle kunder og dårlig opførsel , skal_man lede længe efter .
negative	arbejdernes landsbank er_blevet noteret hos venner , bekendte og familie , som en uærlig , uprofessionel og utroværdig bank .
negative	kan_kun på_det kraftigste advare mod at bruge arbejdernes landsbank .

negative	fik_en ordrebekræftigelse , men et_par dage_senere får_jeg_så en mail om at de_ikke_kan levere varen .
negative	hvorfor i himlens navn butikken vælger at have varer på_deres side som de_ikke_kan levere er_en gåde .
negative	det_er jo_ikke første_gang , kan_jeg se på anmeldelserne her .
negative	ja det lokker kunderne til , når de tror de kan_få varen hos jer , men tro mig kunden er skredet igen , når kunden finder ud_af man_ikke_kan stole på jer .
negative	jeg bliver aldrig kunde_hos jer og_vil advare venner , familie , bekendte og fora mod at bruge miinto . dk
negative	mcdonalds , falkoner alle 00 , køber en happy meal , får burger og cola , men får at_vide pommes fritterne er klar om 0 0 / 0 minut , men at jeg bare skal sætte mig ned , så kommer hun med_dem .
negative	sætter mig ned og spiser min burger , drikker min cola og venter på mine pommes fritter .
negative	der går 0 minutter , der går 00 , 00 minutter .
negative	ekspedienten som tog imod min bestilling , passerer mig 0 gange med varer_til_andre kunder som kom ind efter mig .
negative	efter 00 minutter , går jeg op_til skranken for at få fat i en manager .
negative	der_står fire ekspedienter ved kasserne og_ingen kunder ud over mig .
negative	minutterne går og_ingen gør antræk til at spørge om_de kan hjælpe_mig med noget .
negative	efter_en_del minutter kommmer der kunder ind , som stiller sig op , skråt bagved mig .
negative	den_ene af ekspedienterne kigger hen over skulderen på mig_og spørger om_de kan hjælpen kunden bagved med noget .
negative	jeg afbryder ekspedienten og spørger ham hvorfor han tager den kunden istedet ?
negative	intet_svar .
negative	jeg beder ham om at tage fat i en manager .
negative	ind kommer manager bummelum .
negative	" kan_vi lige gå herover ?"
negative	" nej ", siger jeg , " vi_kan stå her .
negative	er du bange for at kunderne skal høre om jeres dårlige service ?"
negative	jeg forklarer sagen , hvorefter han ytrer følgende undskyldning .
negative	" det_er vi kede af , det_var_en forglemmelse ".
negative	en forglemmelse !!!!
negative	er_det så også en forglemmelse , når 0 medarbejdere ikke_kan finde_ud_af at ekspediere en kunde og derefter tager kunden bagved .
negative	jeg beder om hans navn .
negative	der_står der siger han og peger på sit skilt .
negative	ok , manden kunne så ikke sit navn , så_jeg kigger på hans skilt og skriver navnet ned .
negative	han siger , min leder sidder der , du_kan tale_med hende .
negative	ja tak , siger jeg .
negative	velkommen til leder bummelum , der sikkert har taget sin leder uddannelse , på 0 timer , i ronald macdonald huset .
negative	" kan_vi lige gå herover , der_er ingen grund_til at indvolvere hele restaurenten " " hvorfor ikke ?"
negative	spørger jeg , " de andre kunder vil vel godt vide hvor dårlig service i har ".
negative	intet_svar .
negative	herefter følger den sædvanlige smøre om at det_er hun ked af og_det_er_ikke iorden , osv osv .
negative	jeg fortæller hende at medarbejderne nok skulle uddannes bedre , hvorefter hun stolt fortæller at hun er_den der_har uddannet dem .
negative	det siger vist alt .
negative	problemet skal klares , hurtigst muligt , så leder bummelum , spiller nu gavekort - kortet .
negative	hun spørger om_jeg_vil have et .
negative	jeg forklarer hende at det_er jo hendes valg om hun vil give mig et og om hun mener det_vil give mig en_god_oplevelse .
negative	hun henter derefter et gavekort på 00 ,-_kr , samt de manglende pommes fritter i en " gå - ud - af - døren - pose ".

negative	kunden spørger om nogle ting , hvortil medarbejderen begynder at svine det selskab til jeg arbejder i . jeg kigger på medarbejderen , ryster på hovedet og finder et andet sted at handle .
negative	magen til uhøflig opførsel skal_man lede længe efter og rimeligt rystende at man syntes det_er ok i cybercom .
negative	et lille råd til cybercom : hvis_man vil sælge noget skal_man nok_ikke stå og svine andre til .
negative	specielt ikke kunderne eller kundernes arbejdsplads .
negative	det_vil nok være en fantastisk ide at holde den slags for sig selv .
negative	jeg_kommer da heller_ikke ind i jeres butik og begynder at svine jer til .
negative	i mistede en handel , en kunde og_jeg_kan_kun på_det kraftigste advare imod at handle_med denne butik .
negative	so , i bought a ubisoft - game heroes vi .
negative	was looking_forward to playing the game , but this is when the fun_begins .
negative	first i have to go through what seems 00 restarts of game , because_ubisoft can not figure_out to make an autoupdater that updates the game to the latest_version in one go .
negative	patch after patch after patch .
negative	ok ubisoft , heres an idea .
negative	why not just compile the patches into one patch that updates the game to the latest_version .
negative	finally starts up the game and for fun i decide to play a simple skirmish .
negative	me against the computer .
negative	hours of building up my army , expanding , etc and all of a sudden i am back at the main_menu .
negative	why ??
negative	because_ubisoft newest idiotic masterpiece is that you must be online all the time to ensure you have a legal_version .
negative	unfortunately for me and apparently something ubisoft fail to understand , you sometimes loose connection .
negative	so because i lost connection , ubisofts crap could not see i have a legal_version , so it threw me back to main_menu in game .
negative	all gameprogress was lost .
negative	even getting back online , does not help .
negative	dear ubisoft , who in your company came up with this brilliant idea ?
negative	please_let us know who the person is .
negative	that person deserves a medal for stupidity .
negative	in your infinite stupidity in trying to punish a group of people that dont care about all your little securitymeasures , because they just remove them or find a workaround , you are actually only punishing your paying customers .
negative	do you in any way feel that is brilliant business ??
negative	do you feel you are accomplishing anything positive in regards to your paying customers ?
negative	do you believe or even hope that i will buy another product from ubisoft again ?
negative	am i the only one with this problem ?
negative	not really .

negative	min kones nyoprettede konto stod 000 ,-_kr .
negative	i minus og_jeg_ringer selvfølgeligt for athøre hvad_der_er sket .
negative	hertil får_jeg et flabet svar " det_er jo hvad det koster at oprette en konto ".
negative	000 ,-_kr .
negative	for at oprette en konto der i alle andre banke koster 0 ,-_kr .
negative	det kaldes ekstrem grådighed .
negative	da_jeg selv i øjeblikket kigger efter ny bank , var jeg for nyligt til " møde " i danske_bank .
negative	jeg sad til forhør i 0 timer , for herefter at få beskeden " da du / i ikke_har 00000 ,-_kr .
negative	tilovers , når alt_er betalt , er du / i ikke økonomisk interessant for os ".
negative	ved ikke helt i hvilken verden danske_bank befinder sig i , men_der_er_ikke særlig mange familier , der_har 00000 ,-_kr tilovers når alt_er betalt .
negative	og hvorfor det_tog en medarbejder i danske_bank 0 timer at afvise en_ny kunde , på så svinsk et grundlag , er_en gåde .
negative	jeg_har_aldrig misset en regning , økonomien stabil og kan stille rigeligt med sikkerhed , i forhold_til mine små lån , osv .
negative	men_det_er åbenbart ikke nok for danske_bank .
negative	sender_en klage_over danske_bank , deres metoder , behandling og opførsel .
negative	her er danske banks svar i sin fulde længde :
negative	hej jan
negative	tak for din henvendelse via bankens hjemmeside .
negative	jeg_skal beklage de oplevelser du har_haft på vores afdeling .
negative	med venlig_hilsen
negative	xxxxxx - xxxxxxx xxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx

negative	dette_er hvad danske_bank mener er_en grundig behandling_af_en klagesag .
negative	deres svar blev_sendt en time , måske to , efter klagen var indgivet .
negative	intet ansvar taget , ingen forklaring , kun at danske_bank skal beklage de oplevelser jeg_har_haft .
negative	i har et problem med service , opførsel , behandling_af nye kunder eller potentiel nye kunder .

negative	for et_par år siden , havde_jeg store problemer_med_min tidligere bank , der skruede renterne på mine lån op , så_jeg bare sad og betale renter .
negative	og glemte da_også lige at informere mig_om rentestigningerne .
negative	fik et møde i stand med nykredit , en bisidder og_jeg .
negative	det_blev på mange måder et_godt møde .
negative	i samråd blev vi enige om hvilke spilleregler der skulle_være og hvordan jeg_ville behandles som_kunde .
negative	nykredit gav løfter om at sådan ville de aldrig gøre og renterne skulle jeg_ikke bekymre mig_om , de_ville aldrig nå eller overstige de vanvittige renter jeg betalte i gamle bank .
negative	nykredit har til trods for dette valgt at skrue renterne på mine lån op_til at de nu overstiger det som den gamle bank var og som nykredit gav garantier for aldrig ville ske .
negative	jeg forsøgte at klage_over dette i november .
negative	det_blev ignoreret .
negative	jeg klagede over dette i januar .
negative	det_blev ignoreret .
negative	har_nu klaget igen , men nykredit vil stadigt ikke tage hverken ansvar eller overholde de løfter de selv gav .
negative	den klageansvarlige enhed har bygget deres begrundelse , på de oplysninger de_har indhentet fra_min bankrådgiver .
negative	flot , det_er jo netop den bank der løber fra al ansvar og løfter .
negative	hvad har man egentligt en klageenhed for i nykredit , hvis den lukker øjnene og " ignorerer " de klager og problemstillinger de_får ??
negative	?
negative	er_det i det_hele taget lovligt at love kunden guld og grønne skove , give løfter og garantier , for derefter senere at løbe fra det ???
negative	det_er da i den grad forkert rådgivning og_har givet mig yderligere udgifter , da_jeg_skulle optage nye lån , ved flytningen til nykredit , til betaling af gamle lån .
negative	havde_jeg vidst at nykredit ville løbe fra_deres løfter , havde_jeg jo_ikke valgt de udgifter .
negative	dette ansvar er nykredit også løbet fra og_bliver bare affærdiget med at " der jo altid er udgifter ved at optage lån ".
negative	jeg_har endda forsøgt at lægge op_til løsningsforslag på sagen / problemet , men_også dette har nykredit afvist .
negative	jeg_har altid betalt mine regninger og_der_har_aldrig været problemer_med_min økonomi .
negative	jeg_kan slet_ikke forstå at nykredit mener det_er i deres interesse at behandle deres gode kunder på_denne måde .
negative	jeg_vil i hvert tilfælde ikke_finde mig i det og_vil advare alle imod at bruge nykredit .
negative	hvis nykredit ikke_vil leve op_til deres løfter , garantier , rådgivning , osv , så må sagen jo løses af andre kyndige hænder .
negative	opdatering 00 - 00 - 0000 :
negative	her er svaret fra klageansvarlig enhed :
negative	" vi_har noteret os dine synspunkter , men har_ikke yderligere bemærkninger herfra ."
negative	så_er_det vist rimeligt tydeligt , selv for kundeambassadøren at nykredit ikke ønsker at leve op_til de løfter , garantier og ansvar de gav .
negative	nykredit vil_ikke samarbejde eller finde en løsning og ønsker tydeligvist en konflikt .
negative	i ordered some goods from field and trek , great price , the order was delivered very promptly but did not contain all of my items .
negative	i have now tried to contact them numerous_times via their web_site and by letter and never received a response .
negative	i eventually found a phone_number on their amazon seller profile , they don_'_t have one on their own web_site .
negative	when i called them they sent me a form to fill in and said they would investigate .
negative	they said this may take a while because they need to get information from the courier .
negative	i explained that this was not necessary as the parcel was completely intact and sealed , nothing went missing in transit , the goods were clearly never in the parcel in the first place .
negative	i returned the form immediately and now over two_weeks_later have not received any response or even an acknowledgement of the form despite following up with several e_mails .
negative	they also required me to sign the form and scan it or print it out and sign it and post it which was very inconvenient as i don_'_t have a scanner .
negative	this is ridiculous for an online service .
negative	it is now over a month since my original order and i have yet to receive the goods or any response whatsoever from field and trek .
negative	so beware , the prices are great and the delivery was prompt , but if there is a problem the customer service to sort it out is virtually non_- existent .
negative	we were billed for messages left from current patients , messages left while we were closed ( weekend ), and messages for services we don_'_t provide .
negative	when calling to dispute the charges the customer service rep was terrible , and ultimately hung_up on me .
negative	i would not recommend this service to any colleauges .
negative	as of friday of the week before last i have been waiting for a cold_air_intake that i ordered .
negative	now a week and two_days_later still nothing .
negative	purchased a taillight for a 0000_chrysler town country it was broken when received the

negative	exceptiable cheep taiwan parts i paid $_000_dollars for not happy with service or

negative	i order rotors for my bmw_x0 , 0l engine 000 / 00 mm
negative	i receved rotors 000 / 00 and i still not receved authorized rma_# to rturned the item !!!!!!
negative	!
negative	they claim they attempt to deliver my package three_times , but in fact i was home all day there was no delivery and no door tag was left on my door , and that '_s already after 00 phone_calls
negative	go with ups
negative	i bought 0 packets of tennis strings .
negative	delivery charge was £ 0 .
negative	it took 0 days to arrive .
negative	not acceptable in this day and age .
negative	if they ship you the wrong parts you have to pay return shipping , what '_s with that ?!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
negative	!
negative	got back to birmingham from dubai and the phone_number they gave was switched off for more than 00_minutes , i was about to book hotel as i had no way home .
negative	last ditch attempt to call and they answered , no apology !!!
negative	never again !!
negative	meteor or purple every time
negative	i completely agree with aaa '_s above comment .
negative	regarding swedish stay_away from this program !!!
negative	i '_ll reiterate what he said by first repeating him , then giving you my two cents !
negative	if aaa said that so long ago , he '_s right they aren_'_t going to fix their mistakes , and they know they are ruining people , and taking their money for it !

negative	don_'_t bother if you ' re trying to learn swedish .
negative	it '_s probably fine for other languages , but if you ' re going for swedish , avoid babbel .
negative	mistakes galore that they won_'_t bother to fix , despite the hundreds of feedback messages about it .
negative	the website has the potential to be great , but the fact that it '_s littered with mistakes makes it useless .
negative	try pimsleur instead .
negative	very effective .

negative	babbel swedish is indeed psycho babbel nonsense , a dialect of swedish that is unique to the rest of the world that they conjured from their imagination .
negative	if you have signed_up to learn swedish with babbel , try get your money back quick , and go with another program that will not ruin your abilities to speak swedish !
negative	" to babbel
negative	i wonder_how happy your many users would be when they realize that you have taught them incorrectly .
negative	i wonder what they will think when they realize that it isn_'_t swedish , because not a single swedish speaker on the planet talks like that using the wrong definite and indefinite articles for every_single word you are teaching them ."
negative	yes , there are many that i '_ve reported to them that they have not fixed .
negative	i have a few native swedish speakers living in my household , and have contacted other native swedish speakers to make it crystal_clear .
negative	perhaps babbel simply used a translation service of their own that is in error , or is using somebody from a village out in the middle of the woods that nobody is aware of , that speak in a way that nobody_else does .
negative	they often times use archaic words , or simply the wrong translation .
negative	one really crazy example that comes to mind is that they will teach you that rejäla means savory .
negative	just go and ask any native swedish speaker if that is correct and notice the weird look on their face .
negative	i guarantee it .
negative	quite a few_times , i had to delete words from the vocab review manager , because it was so wrong .
negative	i simply point out the indefinite articles , because its so often wrong , that i only saw it right one time , and that when you actually start using your language skills , it will be difficult to correct yourself or get the idea out of your head that that word does not mean what you are trying to say , but " the " whatever .
negative	it won_'_t be impossible , but frustrating and time_consuming , in light of the fact that you paid for this program .
negative	they have told me that they plan on fixing just the definite / indefinite articles in the spring time .
negative	i have completely stopped using this program in the meantime , and i feel am not getting my money '_s worth .
negative	they refuse to apologize , or at_least give me the extra time back that they took to ' correct ' their program .
negative	i hope this helps .
negative	stay_away from these scammers .
negative	bestilte_et_par for 0 uger siden .

negative	i bought a diamondback sprint bike from asda direct and it was delivered after 0 days – so_far so good .
negative	unfortunately the bike had several faults . including brakes and headset and had to be sent back .
negative	it took 0 phone_calls to asda customer_services before i got a positive response .
negative	once the return process was under way it took 0 days before the bike was collected and another 00 days before i got a refund .
negative	if you are looking to buy a bike online do yourself a favour and look for another supplier - avoid asda direct .
negative	i must have wasted 00_hours on assembly , repacking , phone_calls and waiting for couriers .
negative	asda gave_me an_apology on my answerphone but that was the extent of it - no recompense of any sort .
negative	i have been a loyal_customer of amazon . co . uk for many_years_now , spend a considerable_amount of money , and never had any_problems .
negative	until the 0st of april this year , i was more than content with amazon , that is until they decided to cancel the free delivery option to countries within the eu apart_from uk and ireland .
negative	amazon provided no_explanation at all regarding this change of business_practice , quite_frankly it feels as though they just do not care , i '_m shopping elsewhere .
negative	im very unsatisfied ..
negative	i have tried to use ebay on two occasions and had a terrible outcome both_times .
negative	when you get stiffed by a seller , they will tell you it is a paypal matter .
negative	when you contact paypal , they will tell you it is an ebay matter .
negative	thus , the endless volley begins .
negative	i have never had this problem with amazon , so i am sticking with them .
negative	you will be wise to do the same .
negative	horrible customer service and followup
negative	i would not recommend you to partsgeek .
negative	i wasted well over $_000 in cell_phone minutes , over 0 hours across several phone_calls , being on hold , being transferred , etc .
negative	i booked a ticket , did not get confirmation so called and was told it did not go through so book it again .
negative	ended_up having two tickets charged for via delayed confirmation of the first .
negative	trying to clear it up was endless frustration , and being told i '_m a value expedia customer about 0 times in three engagements .
negative	sent note to c - level team at travelocity , and received nice call and " coupon " but no word on how to use it , not in my acct , and then told it had limitations and have to remember some complex way to actualize it .
negative	tried to clarify that and only got more incompetence and still no clear answer .
negative	giving up entirely on travelocity .
negative	i spend over $_00k per year for me and much more for my team -- will never recommend or use travelocity again .

negative	warning !
negative	homesecuritystore sent me a defective motion_sensor .
negative	they gave_me an_rma_number to return the sensor but made me responsible for the paying shipping fee to their warehouse and shipping for a repaired or new sensor !
negative	being that they sent me a defective product they should stand_behind their equipment and at_least cover the cost of shipping just out of mere inconvenience .
negative	their policy is their policy so be warned .
negative	problem was not_necessarily with auto_europe , but avis who they placed the booking with .
negative	rented vehicle for driving around southern france .
negative	i called to make_sure i could get a gps system , but when i got there , they had none .
negative	counter support couldn_'_t care less .
negative	the car was supposed to be a mercedez c class , but was substituted .
negative	the substituted car was completely under powered and difficult to use controls .
negative	without a gps system , it was impossible to navigate around the cities .
negative	we spent the whole evening lost and could find the resturant we wanted to use .
negative	i am usually pretty good with directions , but avignon was impossible .
negative	we had to revise trip so that we could go back the next_day and get a gps system .
negative	gps ended_up costing 00 euro more that quoted , and we had it one less day .
negative	facebook can '_t protect you from being fired for putting up stupid stuff which an employer uses to send you to the exit doooooor !!!

negative	so now , i deleted everything , afraid to put anything , and no_longer enjoying the hottest social_network on the internet ... this is truly sad and very so much a violation of freedom of speech ...
negative	if paypal were needing a kick in the butt , i would lend them my foot or boot and drop kick them straight to hell ... they should not be connected to ebay and are worthless and not responsive to customer needs at all ... they are a useless entity and don_'_t ever use them ...
negative	i booked a hotel and nada !
negative	came to hotel and they said that our hotel was not booked .
negative	absolutely terrifying and un reliable .
negative	i ordered a water_pump for 0000_honda insight , got it like 0 business days_later and it '_s a wrong part and then i find out their return_policy that no matter whose false the buyer is responsible for the shipping both_ways , plus they promise torefund money only 00 days after they get the part back .
negative	there is no number to call and i know why because they don_'_t want to deal with customers that deserve better service .
negative	very bad company .
negative	while the site is easy to use , the company failed to follow through on service , which made the entire_process an exercise in frustration .
negative	shipping to the gold course was an aggravation because shipsticks didn_'_t scheduled the pick_up by ups until 00_minutes after the latest pickup time ( 0 :_00pm ).
negative	by then it was too_late to get a ups driver back to my area .
negative	as a result , i had to drive my clubs 00 miles to the nearest ups distribution_center and drop them off .
negative	hardly the convenience i was promised .
negative	when i tried to contact customer service , all i got was a personal voice_mail , and that person never returned my call to explain what went wrong .
negative	the company never made any attempt to compensate me for my troubles or returned my call .
negative	when i shipped the clubs home again i called and left a message asking that the pick_up be confirmed .
negative	i got a call back from an indignant customer service representative saying that pick ups were automatically scheduled .
negative	i explained to him the earlier events and his response was that it could never have happened and ups must have lied about it .
negative	the return shipment was not received after six days so i tried to track the shipment using the tracking i ' d provided on my shipsticks receipt , only to find that the number provided was not the ups_tracking_number but the internal shipsticks tracking_number .
negative	i had to reprint the shipping_label to get the ups number so i could track my package .
negative	all in all , a very unpleasant_experience and i would not use this company again .
negative	we paid £_00 . 00 for guaranteed saturday delivery .
negative	the costume was not delivered in time leaving us with one day to find an_alternative .
negative	we waited in all day for the delivery and the tracking service was useless at providing us with any update .
negative	furthermore no one available on the company '_s customer service number to talk to .
negative	over all we feel very disappointed and let_down .
negative	we would not use escape again .
negative	paid for next_day delivery , came 0 days_later ... tried to complain and was pretty_much told i should have read the t & c '_s better as next_day delivery was actuakky next_day after they decide to dispatch it not next_day after you had purchased it .
negative	i will not be using this service again ...
negative	cheaper here ...

negative	i ordered dry verge sections for my asymmetric roof after querying the photographs on the web_site which seemed to indicate that ' left ' sections fitted to the right side of verge .
negative	i was told on the phone to just order the correct number of left and right pieces and ignore the photos which were supplied by the manufacturer and out of their control .
negative	when the dry verge sections arrived i discovered that the ' left ' sections really do fit to the right side of the apex .
negative	i telephoned to request the missing two sections and was told that they could not find who had spoken to me prior to my order being placed .
negative	i was left with the only option of ordering additional sections at my own_expense .
negative	i now have two spare sections which are of no use .
negative	i felt that i was treated with total disregard as if the whole thing was my own fault and though the product itself is satisfactory i will never use this company again .
negative	i ordered 0 parts from this company and the main piece showed_up broken .
negative	i am haveing a hard time getting any help on this .

negative	havde_en oplevelse i aalborg lufthavn hvor en norwegian medarbejder klart overskred sine beføjelser .
negative	istedet for at være flyselskabspersonale , mente han at kunne opføre sig som lufthavnspersonale .
negative	jeg oplevede at blive fysisk forhindret adgang_til sikkerhedstjek efter_jeg manuelt havde tjekket ind_på de manuelle tjekindautomater .
negative	hvorfor ?
negative	fordi en_af norwegians personale opdagede , at jeg_havde min computer i hånden og ikke i min rygsæk .
negative	hvorfor var_den ikke pakket ned i min rygsæk ?
negative	fordi 00 sekunder efter_jeg tjekkede ind skulle jeg gennem sikkerhedstjek ca .
negative	00 meter fra tjekindautomaten .
negative	et sikkerhedstjek hvor_man_skal have computeren op af tasken .
negative	men_som sagt blev_jeg fysisk forhindret af_en norwegian medarbejdere , at gå hen til sikkerhedstjekket , før_jeg_havde vist ham at computeren godt kunne være i min taske .
negative	en fuldstændig unødvendig magtdemonstration - der_ikke hører norwegians personale til .
negative	deres personale kan formene mig adgang_til flyet , hvis_jeg_har mere håndbagage en et stk .
negative	de kan_ikke give lufthavnsbesøgende direktiver !
negative	denne opgave tilfalder udelukket lufthavnspersonale !
negative	ville deres norwegianmedarbejder have mig_til at vise at min computer kunne være i min rygsæk , måtte han vente indtil jeg befandt mig ved gaten på_vej ind i deres fly .
negative	ikke et vilkårligt sted i lufthavnen !
negative	!
negative	men_det synes denne medarbejder tilsyneladende ikke .
negative	og på_deres facebook side sætter de ( gamle ?)
negative	medarbejder til at diskuterer med mig under deres egne fb - profiler , istedet for selv at kommenterer på klagen .
negative	dårligt !!

negative	i arrived at the facility with a trailer in tow of items to be stored in my newly reserved space .
negative	i waited for 00 minuets while the confused receptionist reviewed my paperwork and compared with her own paperwork ( confirming she had received my reservation ).
negative	then another man who worked there came out and said that they didn_'_t have the space that i requested because she had rented it earlier that morning .
negative	they suggested i go down the street about 0 miles to a competitor '_s facility .
negative	was extremely dissatisfied and will not use this site again !

negative	i thought i was getting a great deal but when i found the same deal at bookit a day later ( almost $_000 . 00 cheaper ) their staff was unwilling to help me .
negative	!
negative	i ordered a pool_cover , was suppose to be overnight shipping got 0 days_later
negative	i bought something from them and they sent me the wrong part .
negative	and they won_'_t even take it back .
negative	wtf !
negative	i recently bought a $_00 dollar ultimate_game card and a $_00 ultimate_game card which should have gotten me a bonus 000 zen for my star trek online account .
negative	i applied the codes and only got the face value .
negative	the only reason i went through the extra trouble of buying my zen this way was for the bonus .
negative	i contacted customer service and told them this to which they responded that the issue was not their fault and that i should contact the game '_s customer service .
negative	i understand that the problem may or may not have been theirs , but as a service provider it should always be their problem to assist in solving a customer '_s problem .
negative	their apparent disregard has convinced me to never use them again and i will be letting all 000 + members of my guild / fleet know how i was treated here as i '_m sure some of them have used this company before .
negative	not anymore , not after this .
negative	the only way i will reconsider my position is if someone within the company reads this and actually values treating customers right .
negative	if they give me what is owed to me , then i may possibly see past this particular experience and give them another shot , but until that happens , they have lost a customer over this .
negative	how rubbish a company you are to not even be able to ship a tv .
negative	how can you be a delivery company if you don_'_t ship one of the most basic of things !
negative	as a real_estate company , we buy a lot of building products , never have i been treated in such an unprofessional manner .
negative	we have used architectural depot for all our shutters on every house we have renovated for the past 0 years , always very happy with services .
negative	we recently ordered shutters and planned the delivery date to be end of the week of may_00th , they arrived that thursday , one of my employees drove over 00 miles to install that friday only to find no hardware to intall .
negative	i didnt think this would be an issue , since we have had great service prior .
negative	i called and spoke to lauren who made it clear , thay would only ship out next business day !
negative	since it was their problem , i asked them to ship it out asap so we could get them saturday to install and have our open house sunday .... she went on to inform_me that i should of been there for delivery thursday and opened the boxes then so they would of been able to ship them to us overnight for friday , she kept on repeating this like a child over an over with smart tones to her voice ... at that point , i knew it was a waste of time with any further_discussion , i asked to speak to a manager , i was sent to her managers v / m , which i never received a call back from ?
negative	to further this , my project manage called today wednesday may 00 looking for the hardware and was told it was shipped regular mail and they didnt know when we would receive it ... we will never use this company ever again or reccomend them to other contractors !
negative	i have been waiting for a refund of $_000 . 00 since january 00 - 0000 and although i have contacted jak ( jerome ) 0 times since that date i have not as yet received the credit which i was promised .
negative	jak has all the particulars of the case and assures me that he is following up on the case with the vancouver office and with the accounting_department but i can '_t believe that after such a long waiting period nothing is happening .
negative	can you help resolving this issue ?

negative	i am presently in mexico and do not expect to be back in canada till later in march .
negative	after buying and paying for two tyres the next_day i was told you had no stock and didn_'_t have a date when you would have stock .
negative	so why they were advertised on your website as in stock i am not sure ?
negative	i waited_till the next_day to see if you could find stock or give me a date when you expected stock , unfortunately you couldn_'_t give me a date so i cancelled and got a refund .
negative	i assumed blackcircles would be the cheapest but when i went to my local ats they did them for the same price so i will probably go to them for my tyres in future .
negative	very difficult to cancel service .
negative	have to get in ' live_chat ' as no facility to cancel on accounts page .
negative	as i had one website from one . com auto renew i cancelled 0nd site in advance .
negative	( the other site auto - renewed and stole payment from my card !)
negative	i cancelled website before auto - renewal kicked in but was then told i must pay for another years subscription ( at full rate - note no discounts for renewal ) as i hadnt cancelled in writing 00 - days before renewal was up .
negative	this is a complete con , only set - out to make it very difficult to cancel .
negative	i complained about this but the company merely referred me to some hidden clause in terms and conditions .
negative	very poor experience - avoid avoid avoid !
negative	ordered a complete bathroom package , told it would be with me friday .
negative	didn_'_t arrive .
negative	chased it up and they said it would come wednesday .
negative	when it did arrive shower screen that was part of order was not present , instead 0 bath screens had been included in order .
negative	poor to say the least .
negative	it gets worse ... told by my plumber waste was wrong so called to tell bathrooms000 .
negative	they insisted this could be the case , but i emailed photos all the same .
negative	chased up my emails with mutiple calls only to eventually be told that the waste i ' d be sent was discontinued so they ' d send me out another .
negative	my plumber was waiting to finish bathroom ( and costing me more money !)
negative	so i had to send him out to the shop to buy another waste ( wasting more time ) and all i was offered by general_manager was a £_00 refund .
negative	this customer service is way off !
negative	i ordered a part from this company and it was the wrong_size .
negative	i literally went through all of the steps of picking my year , make , model , and they sold me the wrong part .
negative	it '_s been weeks and the return process is such a hassle !
negative	i still have no refund or a new part !
negative	terrible customer service , internet is slow and constantly disconnecting .
negative	would never recommend to anyone .
negative	my packages were due to be picked_up between 0000 and 0000 .
negative	at 0000 they had still not been collected .
negative	after phoning parcel_force they informed me there had been a problem with communication with uni_baggage .
negative	i was due to fly out of the country the next_day and needed my packages sorted .
negative	having paid for the express 00 service i was again disheartened to find that of my three packages , one arrived 0 day late and the other two were 0 days late .
negative	i was saddened even more to see the condition my packages arrived in .
negative	i had damaged items and the cases were battered , while unpacking the packages i also found a red female glove that i had not packed .
negative	this led me to believe my packages had been opened and tampered with .
negative	i am still checking to see nothing was missing .
negative	i am a very unhappy customer and will not be using uni_baggage again !
negative	i also urge_anyone_who is considering using this service to tread carefully .
negative	they had hp touchpad listed as in stock and took the order on friday_night only to eventually say that it was a mistake on the part of their supplier .
negative	the wrong part was sent to me ; they even admitted it was their mistake ...
negative	but their policy is " tough sh_t ."
negative	the part would cost me too much to return so i am stuck trying to sell it on my own .
negative	i would not recommend doing_business with parts_geek .
negative	never again .
negative	i have not received my order yet why can '_t you send it to a post_office box ?
negative	i paid almost $_00 to order contacts from opticontacts . com , and i never received the contacts .
negative	horrible .
negative	first they double charged me for my items and then sent me the wrog parts .
negative	they also refused to pay for return shipping .
negative	i don_'_t expect a delivery driver to laugh when i have stayed in all day to wait for him , and ask why he can '_t be bothered to ring to let_me know when he is 00_mins away .
negative	the idiot is lucky i was in a good mood .
negative	a twelve hour delivery ' window ' is more of a conservatory , i can '_t believe you are incapable of offering am or pm and the particular delivery driver needs to be retrained or sacked .
negative	poor , not impressed .
negative	rubbish service , went to the garage as requested in the afternoon at 0 :_00pm , garage closes at 0pm , told that they were to busy , had to make a new appointment decided to get a refund , never use them again rather pay more and get a service .
negative	very noisy , bathroom window would not close , to shower the handle would spin
negative	this is not the quality i expected after_reading info about the mattress .
negative	i bought it for my young son and it will do for now , however i expect to upgrade to a sprung mattress in the new year and use this as a sleep over bed .
negative	i was surprised the the mattress was not ' badged ' as every other mattress i have ever bought has_been - i was left feeling that they could have sent me any old thing rather_than the mattress i had ordered .
negative	paid for the part never got it have sent 0 inquiries .
negative	my first experience was good but this last one was horrible .
negative	i want an immediate full_refund
negative	i was asked to provide an_alternative address for shipping because it was different from my billing_address i called my credit_card and did so .
negative	then i replaced my order and nothing happened - is anyone there ?
negative	as i sat in my house working on a computer - no radio , no tv - complete silence .
negative	i heard my letterbox so immediately went to see what junk_mail i had received .
negative	a yodel note_saying ' we attempted to deliver '..... no you didn_'_t you lie !!
negative	there was no knock - my dogs always bark when there is a noise at front_door and did not bark until the note was posted .
negative	i quickly opened the door and shouted - the driver was already in the passenger_seat and ' getaway ' driver put his foot down .
negative	i have had issues with yodel before but gave them the benefit of the doubt - this time i am 000_% certain there was no delivery attempt .
negative	i immediately rang customer_services who promised a call from manager within an_hour .
negative	guess what ?
negative	another wasted hour unable to leave the house ........ i have made it my mission to make_sure that i will never order from a company who_uses yodel .
negative	as a company myself i cannot_afford to use incompetent , dishonest and untrustworthy companies - and anyone_who employs these_cowboys i deem to be irresponsible .
negative	i wish to criticize partsgeek for perpetrating a scam with freeshipping . com .
negative	i signed_up with freeshipping . com ( apartner of partsgeek ) immediately after buying two items from partgeek .
negative	the membership had a 00 day free first month trial_period after that the member would be charged $_00 . 00 @ month .
negative	aand the member would be refunded the shipping_charges .
negative	i mailed the voucher for a $ 0 . 00 shipping cost rebate and the sales slip from partgeek to freeshipping . com . the same day as i signeding up as a member ,
negative	now , i am rold it will take 0 - 0_weeks to process the rebate .
negative	what this shows is there is no free 00 day trial_period .
negative	what a scam !!!!!!!!!
negative	!
negative	still_waiting for order to arrive - must be on a world cruis
negative	a compilation of reviews by the clueless for the clueless
negative	i was " surcharged " after the fact by the company , for using a credit_card .
negative	there was the original charge and shipping etc ... then 0 days_later a small 0 . 00 charge .... for using a credit_card in the purchase .. wrong !
negative	i will never use them again ... that should have been stated or included at checkout ...
negative	wasn_'_t the amount ,, per se ,, but the fact they hid it ,, and never told me .
negative	i ordered the correct part and you sent the wrong part .
negative	you aren_'_t able to correct your mistake without me sending back the part , reorder the original order , and wait again for the part and then wait for a refund .
negative	this will be my first and last experience with a company that can '_t correct their own errors to say nothing of no one to talk too on the phone .
negative	the only communication is by email which is bogus when it was all your fault .
negative	it is the worst program ever !
negative	urgh !
negative	they send me wrong parts ..
negative	how can you ask me for a review when i havnt received my treadmill yet . please make_sure items are with customer before sending out feedback forms .
negative	i was impressed with the quality of equipment including control unit and sensors .
negative	however after installing the system 0_weeks_ago i am still unable to use it :
negative	issues
negative	0 .
negative	poor to no signal .
negative	cell module reports signal is 0 to 0 and cell tests fail 0 times out of 00 .
negative	audible alarm goes off several_times per day indicating radio modem network failure .
negative	when ordering i explained i live in a rural_area and after 00 years living there at & t has_proven to be the only reliable cell provider .
negative	despite that link sent me a verizon cell module because their database said it would work the best .
negative	0 .
negative	motion_sensor is not pet friendly as indicated .
negative	sensor is set to lowest sensitivity setting and angle is adjusted per instructions to minimize false alarms due to pets .
negative	however my dog sets off the alarm at_least 0 to 0 times per day which makes the motion detector useless 00_% of the time .
negative	if these issues are not resolved soon i will cancel service and credit_card payments .
negative	credit_report has not updated in almost 0 months .
negative	score has_been the same since , however , other_companies show the most_recent report with the most current score .
negative	too much show for little or no service .
negative	we recently ordered two headlights for a 00 dodge_grand voyager .
negative	although they were cheap enough , came on time and were all in one piece , they did not match up with the original wiring_harness .
negative	we tried to contact the company but they never answered there customer service line .
negative	the only way to contact them is through a ticketing e_-_mail service .
negative	when we finally got all the info to send them back , they informed us that they do not pay for return shipping no matter who is at fault !
negative	i got the packages ready to go and sent them back ......$ 00 . 00 later !!!!!!
negative	never order from them unless you are sure you have the right part !!

negative	used_interparcel twice , first time it took 00 days & 00 phone_calls to have the pallet delivered , had to pay extra to have delivered because they do not follow_instructions second occasion booked for same day collection we are now 0 days and not collected yet
negative	if they were nonprofit they might be a little more believable
negative	coverage = 0 / 00
negative	customer service = 0 / 00

negative	customer security = 0 / 00
negative	customer service = 0 / 00
negative	i was with orange since 0000 , like the coverage and ' orange wednesdays ' ( although you can get that with orange paygo sim ), was lazy at changing .
negative	hated the constant loss of signal when it changes from orange to uma !
negative	the fraud , the week of no call back , overpriced contracts , lies of telling price without vat .
negative	terrible internet .
negative	terrible upgrade policy , near_impossible to leave - even after your contracts ended .
negative	friendly but useless customer service .. noone has authority to do anything - the email system doesnt work .
negative	the only reason i got out was because i found out where the fraudulent phone had been sent to and phoned the police who threatened orange !!
negative	!
negative	diabolical , steer_clear , 0g is pointless for at_least 00months , by then your phone will need upgrading and you wont be able to upgrade unless you want a mortgage !!!
negative	!
negative	i found this company `_s delivery charges system totally unfair and felt overcharged because of the following experience :
negative	i had to return three items due to ordering incorrect items and re - order the correct replacements .
negative	i was told it was not possible to return my items on the delivery vehicle of the new items although it was on the same day .
negative	furthermore i thought the charges were excessive anyway at £_00 !
negative	when my new items were delivered i was amazed to hear the returns were going back on the same vehicle although i had paid seperately for a delivery and a return costing in total £_00 . 00 .
negative	following this bad_experience i would not use or recommend this company again .
negative	using autoeurope was a huge_disappointment for me , and confirmed why i had to date relied on the more reputable rental_car companies such as avis or hertz in the past .
negative	i would conclude that this is a company based on borderline fraudulent practice , and certainly not a customer service focused organization .
negative	first issue : national did not have the car we had ordered .
negative	but instead of an honest approach and telling_me this , i was first asked if i would like to upgrade “ for a much reduced rate of only 00 : 00 pounds per day ”.
negative	this would have added $_000 to my initial cost .
negative	second issue : after i declined the “ upgrade ” national then assigned me a car that was not equal to the full size wagon , but they did not tell me when they offered me the car keys .
negative	however , after i read the model and make on the key tag i noted they had made an error .
negative	at that point the operator assigned me the car they had originally tried making me pay the upgrade fee ($_000 ).
negative	therefore , i can only assume that when the ordered car is not available , the policy is to first get the customer to pay for an upgrade rather_than admit the error ?
negative	third issue : national no_longer accepts “ third - party ” car insurance ( your own auto insurance , or the credit_card insurance is not accepted ).
negative	i was informed that this was a “ mandatory policy ” and was in place for a year with national .
negative	this would not have been an issue for me if autoeurope had told me this condition at time of sale and not at the counter when i had no choice .
negative	if a “ mandatory ” option this should have been included with the initial quote .
negative	fourth issue : now that i had no choice but the select their mandatory_insurance at the counter i was told i had to pay an_additional $_000 for full insurance , or $_000 for coverage with a $ 0 , 000 delectable .
negative	the issue with this approach is that it is a huge hidden cost by national , and knowing i had a very large deductible ruined the driving experience .
negative	question ……. where is the customer service in all this , and why would i ever use them again ?
negative	i ordered 0 part off the internet , from parts_geek .
negative	i recieved the parts with in the normal time and opened the box to find the wrong parts .
negative	the part were not even close to what i ordered .
negative	the invoice showed the correct part but the part in the box was wrong .
negative	then i found out that the customer service does not have a person you can talk to , you have to submit a ticket .
negative	i submitted a ticket and a couple days_later they sent me generic instruction on how to send it back .
negative	then in red letters it said not to reply to the email and it gave_me a return number .
negative	then i recieved another email with another return number with instructions not to reply .
negative	later i got a email from customer service with another generic reply on how to return the part .
negative	i replied to the email_asking why i had to pay for return shipping when the error was on there part and to see if they were going to send the correct part and i got another generic reply stating that a customer service representative whould reply in a couple of days , but they never did .
negative	i just got a email_saying they got the part back and should credit my account the price of the part .
negative	so long_story short , 0_weeks_later i still dont have the part , i have never been able to talk with a human , i '_m out return shipping and i am not happy .
negative	i will never do_business with this company again and will tell_everyone i know to go somewhere_else
negative	this shop does not send your items , and you dont get your money back .
negative	i got swindled for 000_euros !
negative	lent , aucune communication , très peu pro
negative	i ordered 0 shirts from 00dallarmall . com and normally wear an xl , but the shirts i ordered i wanted to fit loosely .
negative	i orderd one shirt , a size bigger , and another 0 sizes bigger .
negative	neither of them fit .
negative	the sizes run extremely small .
negative	this order was a huge_disappointment seeing as the shipping took a while too .
negative	needless to say i will not be a return customer .
negative	my wife and 0 year_old son took this company '_s car ( booked in advance ) from zadar airport to pakostane .
negative	the car was ok but air_conditioning did not work - in that heat !
negative	i believe that a serious company would check its cars before sending them on the road .
negative	imagine if you are given a rented car with its air_conditioning broken .
negative	we won_'_t be using these_people again .
negative	murky trading process , entirely too many email
negative	i place an order and you send me incorrect parts i try to contact you guys and you have not replied and im trying to return the parts but like i said you guys havnt answer , i would like to know what do i do with the wrong parts that i have can you please feel free to call me ( 000 ) 0000000 atttn : ruben saavedra
negative	ordered passport photos .
negative	promise to dispatch same day but did not do so .
negative	did not post out next_day either .
negative	sent email_confirming dispatch on day 0 then a few hours_later another apologising and advising not dispatched .
negative	have to go out and find somewhere local quickly tomorrow to get them done .
negative	very unreliable and unprofessional .
negative	this is a completely unprofessional establishment with multiple staff_members at the call_centre who will repeatedly ignore any instruction you might give them , no matter_how clear that instruction may be .
negative	i can understand_why people swear on these calls as i had to scream at them at_least ten times to cancel my contract .
negative	it is apparent they are tasked to either address your concerns and keep your business , or to wind you up so that you put the phone down and give up trying to cancel .
negative	i stuck to my guns and have been told my plan has_been cancelled .
negative	however i am now confirming in writing as i do not trust them and have no proof of the cancellation .
negative	a shameful way to behave .
negative	i bought my lemon coloured branded kettle bbq online .
negative	when i went to put the item together i found the enamel was coming away on the edge of the basin where it should not be .
negative	i did not want to take the risk it would worsen in use so i asked for it to be returned on the basis it was damaged .
negative	riverside have refused to simply arrange for the item to be collected and refunded as clearly requested by me ,( i have had it for 0 days ) advising me they have a strict code of conduct agreed with the manufacturer and i must send photos and they will tell me what happens next !
negative	if they are going to have the original item back in their possession they will not need me to send photos and why are they trying to involve the manufacturer in our transaction ?. they have even tried to get me to call the manufacturer direct for " advice " when my contract is with the garden_centre .
negative	they are doing everything they can to get me to retain the item and to avoid arranging a refund .
negative	in fact , under distance_selling regulations i do not even need to have a reason to return the item at this early stage but i didn_'_t want somebody_else being sent the same slightly_damaged item .
negative	having taken some advice i have a dilema now because i do not feel they can be trusted on the basis of my experience to date and if i send back the item myself i will incur more expense which i cannot_afford .
negative	having read their past feedback i am really surprised that they have been so difficult and have not just apologised and arranged_collection and a refund .
negative	my advice is to check any item you buy immediately , only buy if you can , and are prepared , to photograph any faults ( my camera is only cheap and does not do closeups ) and preferably buy instore and check before leaving .
negative	two attempts to get a pressure_washer delivered quickly .
negative	never believe the time scales the presenters quote - complete rubbish .
negative	the first time i actually had to apply to the small claims_court as the item never arrived at all .
negative	they refunded at the last_minute before the court processed my application .
negative	stupidly have tried again as the price was good and surprise_surprise the item has not been dispatched when promised .
negative	deliberately keep you waiting on the premium_rate phone line which gives them a profit and then the indians just block any attempt to cancel an order .
negative	the man who regularly represents karcher should research their real delivery timescales before quoting inaccurate timescales on tv .
negative	this was the first and the last time i used_interparcel .
negative	i booked a parcel delivery with city_link through interparcel .
negative	it was meant to be a next_day delivery , booked and paid for as such .
negative	needless to say that the parcel was delivered 0 days (!!!!!)
negative	later and no one seems to be concerned or in the know about what has happened .
negative	i had live chats twice with staff at interparcel , all i got out of them was a promise to e_-_mail the courier and get back to me asap .
negative	the parcel has_been delivered to me 0 days_later but i had no answer whatsoever from interparcel .
negative	the staff are still_waiting to hear from city_link - which is a joke of a service .
negative	i rang city_link myself and in spite of being put on hold for about 00_minutes , i got some answers that interparcel never managed to do .
negative	i would avoid interparcel at all costs and city_link too - they are an useless combination !
negative	still_waiting ................ ordered 0 - 0 - 00 , it '_s 0 - 00 today
negative	fedex then to local usps .
negative	we ordered and paid for 0lbs of lobster and received 0lbs . being shorted a whole pound in a 0lb order takes effort .
negative	be aware they ' re prices are well above_average market prices .
negative	we were charged almost $_00 \ lb , market was at about $_00 .
negative	an_email was received stating they wanted to get to find out what happened .
negative	they packed our cooler and when we got home one of the lobsters in particular looked scrawny .
negative	and was a 0 / 0lb under weight .
negative	three 0lb lobsters shouldn_'_t weigh 0lbs .
negative	maybe we were treated this way because we had a gift coupon .
negative	a raving review would have bee more fun to write .
negative	they tainted our_anniversary celebration .
negative	i hope this causes them a few customers in turn .
negative	we '_ve steered a couple away that were waiting to see how it all went .
negative	mainelobsternow has_been given ample opportunity to make this right .
negative	no refund offered .
negative	bottom_line : rip_off !
negative	they suck .
negative	hi , i ordered a 0 gal .
negative	pail of pool paint on thursday_evening 0 / 0 .
negative	i understand that the order was not processed till friday so i assumed the order would have been shipped on friday or monday .
negative	i received a phone_call yesterday , friday 0 / 00 , explaining that my order shipped on thursday 0 / 00 and i can expect it on monday 0 / 00 .
negative	they claim they tried to contact me earlier in the week but couldnt locate my contact info .
negative	to make_sure someone would be home to receive the order even_though my order online with all of my contact info .
negative	stated that i was not requiring a signature upon delivery .
negative	this is unacceptable to me and my customer who expected their pool to be painted this week .
negative	i will not be ordering anything_else from amerimerc in the future .
negative	i purchased two wiper_blades for my mercedes_c000 .
negative	the cost of the blades was $_00 . 00 .
negative	because i live in hawaii , the cost of shipping was $_00 . 00 .
negative	according to the website , these blades will fit .
negative	i did not mind that shipping was more than the blades , as long as the wiper_blades fit my car .
negative	when i received my order , the blades did not fit .
negative	when i contacted customer service , they were no help .
negative	according to the website , the most i can receive is the cost of the blades .
negative	so now i spent $_00 . 00 for two wiper_blades that do not fit my car .
negative	i believe the company should reimburse my $_00 . 00 or send me the correct blades at their expense .
negative	i planned to use partsgeek again ; however , this experience has definitely changed my mind .
negative	i would not recommend this sight to anyone .
negative	service for a return is so bad and you have no one to speak to when the wrong part is sent to you .
negative	plus you have to pay to ship it back .
negative	online i made reservations for a bus_tour on monday may 00 , 0000 , 0 : 00 am .
negative	and then i printed my pre_- paid voucher / ticket .
negative	my family and i went to the departure area only to find out the tour was not going out that day .
negative	i showed them the ticket i printed spelling out the reservation , and i told them there must be some kind of mistake .
negative	no mistake -- not a good way to start a family vacation .
negative	i need my money back !
negative	do not sign a contract with orange they say that they dont need to provide the services .
negative	i barely get network im traying to cancel
negative	basically , i was deceived into singing up for a " free " trial , then they charged me $_00 for not cancelling it on time .
negative	i didn_'_t even there was a charge for a " free "???
negative	trial .
negative	very deceiving and shady practice .
negative	any respectable company would give a refund ...
negative	don_'_t know about the service , since i didn_'_t use it at all .
negative	just tried to contact expedia to have them help me with a modification to my trip .
negative	what a joke that was .
negative	i spoke to a call_center person from a foriegn country that told me that they would not help me at all .
negative	i am an expedia vip custome ( according to them ) and they treated me horribly .
negative	by the way i called the hotel_directly and they took_care of my issue with no problem and at no cost .
negative	expedia service sucks !!
negative	!
negative	i order a left and a right control_arm bushing .
negative	i received two bags each with the correct part numbers on them .
negative	unfortunately the right side part bag contained a left_side part .
negative	i filled_out support request on web ( support_ticket #_000000 ) on april 00 , i requested 0 ) an_rma_number to return the 0nd left_side part , 0 ) to be reimbursed for shipping the 0nd left_side part back ( since partsgeek made the error ), 0 ) they send the correct right side part .
negative	on april_00th i received and rma_number , which i used to send the part back .
negative	on april 00 i received an e_-_mail that the invoice is being credited for returning the part , apparently it is easier for partsgeek to cancel a line item then to ship the correct part .
negative	i am not satisfied at all with partsgeeks .
negative	not a happy experience .
negative	we had to waite 00_mins for the car to turn up on our arrival and when it did there was 00 additional miles on the clock , when i was told that the car would be parked 0 miles_away .
negative	i will look_elsewhere going forward .
negative	the site showed one price but it was totally different when i arrived at the facility .
negative	the facility indicated that every customer who used selfstorage . com indicated that the prices the website showed was never the price the were charged .
negative	the part i received , a gas_cap , does not fit my vehicle .
negative	i was sent the wrong part .
negative	i am attempting return it based on the return instructions and unable to do so .
negative	i '_m waiting for an return number ?
negative	i have sent 0 e_-_mails and have received no number or response from partsgeek .
negative	i have called the phone_number for help and the number just rings after pressing an extension .
negative	i have found a consumer website with all_kinds of complaints about partsgeek return_policy and their lack of support on this issue .
negative	its feeling like a scam with regards to returns .
negative	i '_m sure this opinion will go straight in the trash bin and no action taken on behalf of parts_geek .
negative	parts_geek lack of supports sucks .
negative	i placed my order on 0 / 00 / 00 and was told it shipped on 0 / 00 / 00 however didn_'_t receive order until 0 / 00 / 00 .
negative	i tried to call to find out where my order was but this company does not answer customer service calls they force you to place a customer service ticket online .
negative	you will then receive generic response that has nothing to do to your problem .
negative	they will also say they tried to call you but all of my phones show no missed calls .
negative	they offered two grills for my dodge_ram_0000 and i choose the more_expensive grill however what they sent was the cheaper grill with about a 0 inch corner of it broken off .
negative	the bumper_cover i received was all scraped up with big chunks missing too .
negative	i promptly tried to call but had to open a ticket which i continue to receive generic messages .
negative	never once have they apologized for their error or asked what can they do to correct their mistake .
negative	again they say they have tried to call but no voice_mails or missed calls .
negative	i have contacted visa to dispute the charge since it is impossible to speak to a live_person and i feel the company is not reputable_company .
negative	the items i did receive in good condition i also am returning because the additional warranty is useless since there 0 customer service with this company .
negative	i have ordered several items online and never received customer service this terrible .
negative	i have been advising everyone i speak to and will be posting it at vocational school to never order from parts_geek . com !!!
negative	!
negative	i did not received my items that i had ordered for a special event , i placed an order with plenty of time to manufacture and ship , i did not get notified that national_pen was back ordered until 0 days before my event and that was only because i called and asked , no one bother to call or let_me know that i would not receive my product .
negative	luckily 0imprint . com did have a rush service that i could pay extra and get my items on time .
negative	will never do_business with national_pen ever again .
negative	my books was ordered around the 0 of june_0000 , your company said my books was mailed out on the 00 of june_0000 , here it is june 00 , 0000
negative	and my classes start july , 0 .
negative	0000 , and i still have not got my books , what is this a scam company ?, i will never get books from your company again , when ever the book ever get to me , i will not accept them , i will have the postman return them to you , you can keep the money , i do not want anything to do with your company again .
negative	mr . james l . fludd sr .
negative	these_folks dont have a clue what is going on , it should not take a week for them to pay you for a credit_card transaction .
negative	they quote you 0 . 0 % and charge 0 . 0 % then say " next time it will be 0 . 0 % we promise "
negative	avoid at all cost .
negative	you give a 00 day money back policy then you ask for the customer to full out a ticket and wait for a ticket number before sending item back .
negative	this policy sucks .
negative	because i have been waiting for such a ticket number now for two_weeks .
negative	i still have the wrong item you sent me and had to purchase it from another place because of not being_able to speak with anyone live as well .
negative	therefore thank_you for bad business .
negative	after order had been process problems with payment and promised a call back , never happened !
negative	call next_day to finalise payment to be told order doesn_'_t exists !
negative	then after calling on monday to speak to retake order for delivery by end of week .
negative	then told that order complete and then awaited delivery .
negative	on birthday of brother called as no arrival to be told that payment was declined !
negative	my credit_card has put hundreds on it since and if your customer service was any good a curitisy call would have rectified this entire problem and now after finding all these problems i '_m then told that the items are out of stock n not to be in for 0_weeks !!!
negative	!
negative	really promotes on return business or any business at all !
negative	and then the only compensation i was offered was refunded delivery charge !
negative	pathetic !
negative	mr d . munt
negative	i made an order on wednesday 00th of april from this company since they stated that the delivery time would be 0 - 0 days .
negative	after not receiving the goods in a weeks time i called the customer service the following_wednesday to ask what '_s going on .
negative	john who took my call was very rude and made it very clear that he basically didn_'_t care at all about the problems we encountered due to them not living up to their promises .
negative	now it '_s been two_weeks and i have still not received my parcel .
negative	so if you want your parcel on time , and if you want friendly customer service - do not buy from printerinks .
negative	customer service are unable to tell you what type of colour their t - shirts are , which they state in a arrogant way .
negative	avoid .
negative	bought a suite from them and it does look good but the quality is really disappointing and i have had endless issues .
negative	the toilet flush mechanism does not work - the siphon valve does not shut_off so it constantly overfills .
negative	they have sent out 0 replacements and all had the same problem .
negative	they are adamant their product works but trust me it doesn_'_t .
negative	i had to buy a siphon for £_00 from b_& q and worked_fine straight_away .
negative	also , got issues with the glass shower door .
negative	it does not seal properly at the bottom and is prone to flooding the bathroom .
negative	nightmare !
negative	the only reason i purchased items with pro_import tuners is because i was given the option to pay with " bill me later " on pay pall , now all of a sudden i call pay pall and they don_'_t know how i was given the option to pay with " bill me later ".
negative	bogus schemers
negative	part took 0 week to arrive .
negative	wrong part was shipped .
negative	cant talk to anyone , has to be done by e_mail
negative	had to e_mail them and was told they would get back to me between 00 and 00_hours !
negative	$_00 . 00 restocking_fee even_though they sent wrong part .
negative	made this part fit !!!
negative	!, should not have to do this !!!
negative	!
negative	$_00 . 00 to send core back .
negative	was told that it would be up to 00 days to get credit !
negative	worst customer experience ever .
negative	you wanted to know !
negative	your cartridges leaked all over my printer , floor and hands
negative	i still have red ink and some yellow on my hands .
negative	i '_m glad i did not open the black_ink
negative	some by the name of panda told me i did it wrong .
negative	something about tape over the vent hole ?
negative	you did not state thar .
negative	in fact you did not send information as to how to install the ink cartrages .
negative	i have used h p fo years with out getting ink all over the place .
negative	i know this much i have sent two emails to panda and you have not gotten back to .
negative	the bottom_line is this poor service on you part and i '_m going back to buying hp re fields .
negative	thank_you
negative	howard nielsen
negative	000 - 000 - 0000
negative	cant_wait for my contract to end . nothing but problems worst customer service ever . have had poor connection problems for 0 months finally they sent an engineer not qualified to fix fibreoptic
negative	another waisted day . you could not make it up .
negative	i still have no broadband after four days and they still . cant tell how much longer its going to take ive spent hours on the phone being given the run around its been hell ...
negative	i have ordered probably $_000 in cds and dvds over the last several_years from oldies .
negative	i have had to call customer service four or five times and each time i have come away unsatisfied . it seems they don_'_t tell each other what they are doing nor do they document or fulfill the request . i am still_waiting for the so called customer service to fix their mistake on my order of may 00 , 0000i have recently started to shop at amazon for dvds and cds as their customer service is exceptional .
negative	in the past the customer service was fairly good at oldies but now it stinks . i would give it no stars but that was not an option given
negative	you not only did not respond to my order in a timely_manner , you lost my opportunity to get my part to the address i directed you to send it making me sit here in a third world country without my car running for weeks now .
negative	i had arranged for someone to hand carry the part in their luggage but your failure to send what i wanted to the place i wanted it messed everything up !
negative	good bye and good luck if you want to work with this company be advised , they are only a computer redirect ordering place with no human service !
negative	still have not recieved my refund .
negative	the diamond they sent me was an l and it was described as an h ....
negative	i would not buy from them .
negative	i had to dispute the charge with my credit company .
negative	ordered parts that were labeled on their web_site to fit my vehicle , but were incorrect !
negative	had to pay shipping back and a 00_% restocking_fee all from their mistake .
negative	will not continue to do_business with them again .
negative	not a good way to do_business .
negative	all i can say is be warned .
negative	sorry !
negative	its just the truth .
negative	what a scam !
negative	they got one star only because there is no " zero star " option .
negative	the site does not tell you that any reservation you make is not instant , but is subject to them looking for a car that matches the reservation you make with them online .
negative	this can take anything up to a week , and you might land up paying more than what you committed to on the site .
negative	if you are booking at short_notice and are waiting for the confirmation by return e_-_mail , you may be in for a very nasty shock .
negative	i booked a car with a gps , then was informed nearly a week_later that they could give me the same car for a similar price , but that i would have to pay over 00 euros more for the gps .
negative	by this time , time had run out and i was forced to take their offering .
negative	i spent nearly an_hour with their call_centre trying to sort this out , to no_avail .
negative	talking to their call_centre people is like talking to an automaton - or a brick_wall !
negative	the call_centre refused to put me through to a supervisor or to the managing_director .
negative	they will_definitely never catch me again !
negative	got to destination to no reservation and no room .
negative	i signed_up for a service that provides me with anytime access to my credit_report .
negative	every time i log on it says i can '_t or i have to pay you more money .
negative	what gives ?
negative	i have frequently encountered this same problem with b_&_h : i get a message_saying that i have to have a password .
negative	i don_'_t know that i have a password at b_&_h .
negative	sometimes my order is somehow accepted anyway and in fact i have spent_thousands of dollars at b_&_h .
negative	but this time they just refused my order .
negative	so to hell with it - perhaps i will try again another day .
negative	i attempted to book one night at a holiday_inn express in gallup , new mexico .
negative	i used this serviced called reservation_counter .
negative	from the image on the website i thought i was dealing directly with holiday_inn .
negative	the phone agent from reservation_counter never identified himself as a third_party .
negative	i continued to book my room and supplied the usual credit_card information .
negative	however , when i arrived at the holiday_inn , the receptionist told me that i had been booked twice into the hotel by different agencies , room - reservations . com , or some such .
negative	and another third_party was now involved , expedia .
negative	i was also charged for the double booking .
negative	i was a victim of misrepresentation and financial fraud .
negative	finally , the hotel manager helped_me sort out this problem .
negative	i spent over 00_minutes attempting to straighten this out .
negative	we are still_waiting for the credit_card statement in order to be sure we were not double charged .
negative	overall , it was a most unpleasant_experience .
negative	i learned a lesson .
negative	always deal directly with the hotels .
negative	these booking agencies are trouble , and you are left vulnerable to fraud and duplicity .
negative	terrible service , rude , deceptive .
negative	i ordered a nikon dslr from the website .
negative	no email_confirmation .
negative	day later a guy calls and says i should expect all these problems because i ordered an import .
negative	aren_'_t all nikon '_s imports ?
negative	he gives me the hard sale saying what i ordered won_'_t have a battery , software , manuals , warranty , etc .
negative	for another $_000 my new nikon will come with all the normal accessories .
negative	guy gets rude and pushy when i refuse to engage in his bait & switch .
negative	he suggests my order will take two to three_weeks to arrive .
negative	someone ought to sue abe '_s of maine for false_advertising !
negative	they ' re liars , operating from new_jersey , not maine .
negative	don_'_t waste your time .
negative	ajs construction owned by kermit laforce was asked to come out and fix a leak in our ceiling that appeared to be coming from the chimney area .
negative	they removed shingles around the chimney and caulked .
negative	no true flashing was added .
negative	they told us this would fix our problem .
negative	as soon as the first rain came our ceiling leaked in the same exact spot !
negative	we called mr . laforce and told_him it was still leaking .
negative	he told us it would cost more money to repair somewhere_else .
negative	he says chimney leaks are a guessing game .
negative	he was paid 000 . 00 for the first visit .
negative	how much do you guess it might cost to finally get it right !
negative	we tried_emailing , texting and calling mr . laforce to get him back to our home and finish what he was supposed to fix .
negative	he will not return any of the messages .
negative	paid for upfront but some items were out of stock , gave date that they would arrive then had to be extended plus some items that were in stock were now short ( the terms & conditions that they keep reffering to says when paid in full those items are yours , big lie ) then had to cancel the order as i wanted the other items sent before they were sold to somebody_else apparently thats how they do it !
negative	so reordered & paid but dont refund for severel days so went overdrawn & to top it off the refund was less_than what i had to pay for the same items . wish i could cancel & go elsewhere but it will take too_long to get all the monies returned , my advice buy local and save_yourself the hassle ..
negative	hoping to compare spice qualities
negative	bad_experiences !
negative	no matter where i went this part number you sent me never came up for my vehicle ,
negative	so that being said you guys should know that taking a car apart and not having the right part ?
negative	called and asked if a body was in stock the guy said they had two in stock so i went online and ordered both of them got the confirmation through my email saw the purchase debited from my account and a week_later no package called and guy said they didn_'_t have any in stock and that the order was cancelled without me being notified and i had to ask for my refund
negative	this place is run by robots , no humans involved .
negative	absolutely the worst in communications and trying to resolve_issues .
negative	never again .
negative	nothinf more_expensive than a bargain price that is unusable .
negative	i ordered a part from these_guys for my daughters vehicle , and my daughter call me 00_minutes after i ordered the part and said she didn_'_t needed it .
negative	i tried to get a phone_number from customer service and they don_'_t have one , well needless to say they posted me a e_-_mail_stating that they couldn_'_t cancel the order and to reject or request a rma order and return the part .
negative	to get my money back , so i rejected it and i still_haven_'_t heard or seen my money back yet .
negative	they got my first ever order wrong in which i was left short on a product , after an_email and phone_call another week went buy with no word of getting my product after i sent another email_stating my annoyance , i was told they were sorry and there was a delivery then sent to me which 0 days_later i still_havnt recived , absolutely_shocking service for product which is already below standard
negative	i am know on my third set of front_brake discs from carparts0less the first two_sets warped and had to be replaced in a very short_period , the last set is still in the boot of the car because i dont_know who pays for the post back because i cant speak to anybody as they keep sending me from one department to another and denying responsibility .
negative	it would help greatly if they had a central help_desk just like their parts to deal with customer service .
negative	i spoke to a booking agent at length about the need to have a room with two double_beds and a pullout couch for my family of six .
negative	the agent informed me that the springhill suites had what i needed .
negative	after arriving at the hotel , i was informed that no room in the hotel had that type of accommodation .
negative	ultimately , my wife and i slept on the floor for two_nights .
negative	it was not a good experience at all !
negative	this site used to have a great selection of products at affordable and competitive prices .
negative	costumer support was diligent and effective .
negative	suddenly , they '_ve introduced new outrageous delivery charges with no_explanation , authoritatively informed their customers after the changes were introduced and customer_support refuses to provide any answers other than a pre_- set script .
negative	after this misconduct , i can no_longer consider this site to be trustworthy .
negative	i received my part to find it was damaged .
negative	there is no way to directly call them only a form to fill_out and wait for a response .
negative	going on 0 days and no response .
negative	im extremely dissastisfied and would never use them again or advise anyone_else to use parts_geek .
negative	i can understand stuff happens but the lack of costumer service is unacceptable
negative	i am still_waiting on one of my two products i ordered .
negative	my flight got canceled while i was at the airport .
negative	i had no hotel reservation as i had planned to be on a plane , but no problem .
negative	i just open my travelocity app and search for nearby hotels .
negative	found one , booked a room and whistled merrily to the curb to wait for the hotel '_s shuttle .
negative	when i got to the hotel , however , the front_desk was flustered that i had been able to book a room .
negative	they had been sold out for weeks and had put a ' lock ' on their system to prevent any rooms being sold !
negative	but somehow , travelocity charged me for the room anyway and sent me on a wild goose chase .
negative	luckily , the folks at the holiday_inn express were kind enough to call around and find a hotel with room for me .
negative	i called travelocity at that moment as well , to let them know i needed a refund .
negative	they said ' sure no problem ', kept me on the phone for 0 minutes and then i lost the connection .
negative	i shuttle back to the airport and then shuttled over to my ultimate hotel .
negative	problem_solved .
negative	however , the next_day i still see a travelocity charge on my credit_card .
negative	i phone them up again , and explain the situation again , and about 00_minutes later they say they have my money refunded .
negative	a few_days_later , the charge drops off my credit_card .
negative	overall , i think it is ridiculous that their app let_me book a room in error .
negative	it is more ridiculous that a single 0 minute phone_call didn_'_t get the charge reversed ( it only took 0 seconds for them to charge me in the first place ).
negative	now i remember why i never use travelocity .
negative	you shouldn_'_t either .
negative	waited 0 days for my parcel , and apparently they tried to deliver the previous day , but they can '_t have tried very hard seeing as i made sure i was in the whole day .
negative	no one came to deliver my package , if they did they must of knocked on my door with a feather as i was located very close to the front_door .
negative	if i ever see hermes as the choice of courier i will make_sure not to shop at said store .
negative	clearly the self_employed idea of hermes doesn_'_t work , and i can only assume they lie and say they attempt to deliver something just so they can get paid .
negative	i ordered an aluminium walk - in greenhouse on monday .
negative	they had three_attempts at delivery and i had several long_waits on the customer_services ' telephone waiting for an answer to where is it ?
negative	it is expected that it will be delivered to the local homebase tomorrow a week_later as they said that they couldn_'_t find the address .
negative	i had explained very clearly what to do and given them a telephone_number to ring but there were no messages and no greenhouse all week .
negative	the only ' goodwill_gesture was to offer to refund the delivery charge but there was no offer to pay for the telephone_calls and the long time that i had to wait before getting an answer .
negative	i had booked an apartment through wimdu .
negative	they didn_'_t mention in their advertisement that the apartment is on 0th_floor , and has no lift .
negative	later the owner of the apartment ( it ’_s a 0 start hotel ) had mentioned that there is no lift for this apartment .
negative	immediately i requested the wimdu to cancel , as i am travelling with elderly people .
negative	and i cancelled 0 month before .
negative	they have charged me 00_% of the rent , and additional 00 euros for their service .
negative	i had paid 000 . 00 for rent , and got back 000_euros .
negative	i lost lot of money because the details were not complete in their website .
negative	bought a arctic_spa from you vernon hills store , owner dave .
negative	i have had several issues from the beginning .
negative	none of which went_smoothly .
negative	the store has closed and is in different hands .
negative	i have a new guy servicing my spa .
negative	he has had an order in for weeks with no response .
negative	order # 0000 .
negative	again , the bs continues .
negative	no online support .
negative	the phone rings and rings .
negative	based on your online video '_s the company is there , but where is everyone ?
negative	for years i have struggled with your support .
negative	worst i have every experience .
negative	from an american manufacturer who feels you should be ashamed of your perfessionalism .
negative	i placed an order on feb 00 , which was supposedly shipped via_fedex the same day , however fedex never had any record of the shipment other than a label being created .
negative	i tried for over 0_weeks to get a replacement sent .
negative	they said one was sent , but never received a new tracking_number or order information .
negative	the customer service people kept asking for me to return the part for a refund .
negative	if the part never arrived , because it never left the warehouse , it is pretty difficult to return it .
negative	i explained this multiple_times to the agents who were completely unhelpful .
negative	i still have not received the part or a refund .
negative	very disappointing experience , unlikely i will ever shop_here again even with there cheap prices .
negative	i did eventually receive my order at a good price .... but you get no info from their website as to shipping or order status info .
negative	i had to call them ( got hung_up on the first time ) to inquire why my order did not arrive in the expected timeframe .
negative	was then told very nicely on the phone that the item i choose was on back order .
negative	was then told if i made a minor frame change i could receive my glasses quicker .
negative	i did have a rush order on the original but was not informed there was a problem until i contacted them .
negative	will not be ordering from them in the future , as an_email from them indicating an issue with me order would have eased my concerns .
negative	if i have to pick_up the phone to call on an online order , why should i order online .
negative	very disappointed with their customer service
negative	i ordered two items , neither of which , as it turned_out , was in stock .
negative	nevertheless , bristol cameras immediately helped themselves to full payment .
negative	one of the items was shipped a few_days_later .
negative	two_weeks on and i '_m still_waiting for the vital second item , despite_being promised shipping within a few_days .
negative	the brief telephone_conversation with them gave every indication that they couldn_'_t care less .
negative	i won_'_t be back , and potential_customers should think_twice before dealing_with this retailer despite the decent prices ( and rip - off shipping_charges ).
negative	they booked my date incorrectly over the phone .
negative	when i showed_up to the hotel , there were no remaining rooms .
negative	s . o . l .
negative	terrible .
negative	i tried to make one order of four books and was told after payment that my order failed to go through .
negative	i tried again and got the same message .
negative	the website clearly told me my order was not placed because of an error .
negative	i then ordered the set off a different site and the next_day i received two emails from bookbyte telling_me my orders had been charged .
negative	i emailed them saying i didn_'_t want the books because they had screwed_up my order in the first place and they told me i would have to return each one as it came to me .
negative	really ?
negative	you guys are worthless .
negative	not very detailed about credit and creditors .
negative	nor is there enough help with stuff that is hard to understand .
negative	plus for what you get it cost way to much .
negative	i thought it would be better_than what is was !
negative	your phone line is constantly tied_up , your email process always uses the maximum turn_around time ... please ..
negative	same as above
negative	got a bad part installed it did not work not my fault return_policy sucks .
negative	will never shop with them again !
negative	!
negative	i was trying to book a room for may 0th and the agent said april 0th and i corrected him and he apologized and said that he had changed it when in fact he did not and now i have been charged for a room that i wasn_'_t even the same state to use .
negative	i am now out $_00 . 00 .
negative	i will not recommend your site nor will i ever book again through you site .
negative	first order was fine .
negative	second .... oh dear !
negative	quoted 0 - 0 days on website which turned into 0 - 0_weeks when confirmation of order email arrived .
negative	then i got a request to review the item .... but nothing had arrived .
negative	responded with a comment that they needed to get their act_together , and got an apologetic email_saying it would be next few_days .
negative	two_weeks_later and still nothing , despite email_asking where is it ?
negative	tried phoning them but both " delivery department " and " customer service " just go to voicemail .
negative	update 0_weeks after promised delivery date ....
negative	they now return my calls ( after i leave them messages threatening to cancel the order ) but still unable to give me a delivery date .
negative	i purchased the trip insurance and it was worthless .
negative	i am in afghanistan and was trying to leave and the military cancelled my flight , i then contacted travelocity and explained to them what had happened and they responded that the insurance didn_'_t include this ..
negative	i was then told by the lady i was talking to that the new flight she had for me was 00 dollars cheaper ( which was no problem ) and about a minute later she put me on hold for about 00_minutes and when she came back the flight that was suppose to be 00 dollars cheaper was now almost 000_dollars more .
negative	i asked her about this and she stated she didn_'_t remember what she told me before she put me on hold ... needless to say i will never use travelocity again !!!!!
negative	very disappointed with there service !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
negative	!
negative	each time i call , i wait for 00_minutes and then get cut_off .
negative	there is a manufacturers defect that i need to resolve .
negative	really quite incredible that i cannot get through .
negative	i ordered parts online from parts_geek on 0 / 00 / 0000 , due to a ups delivery issue they were returned back to parts_geek on 0 / 00 / 0000 .
negative	they didn_'_t refund my money until 0 / 0 / 0000 and then kept 00_% of my refund for a restocking_fee even_though the issue was not because of me .
negative	i didn_'_t even receive the packages .
negative	i made several_attempts through their online customer_support to find out why i didn_'_t receive a refund and only got a generic impersonal response .
negative	i will never order from parts_geek again and would not recommend anyone to order from them .
negative	they have poor customer service and by keeping the 00_% restocking_fee when it was returned in the same box they shipped it in and was not due to any issue from me this like like robbing you .
negative	do not order from parts_geek
negative	beware !
negative	partsgeek is a reseller without_any professionalism whatsoever .
negative	they are a reseller without_any expertise and will send out cheap auto part substitutes so they can keep your payment .
negative	they sent me a chevy mirror even_though the order was dodge ( and entirely correct ).
negative	they have a customer service recording that states they no_longer will answer their telephone .
negative	they would not send out a paid return or make any refund even with credit_card company intervention .
negative	bad !
negative	bad !
negative	bad !
negative	avoid at all costs !!!
negative	!
negative	what a crock .
negative	i review a purchase made from a company , now trustpilot wants to be reviewed .
negative	here goes .
negative	delete my email from your files .
negative	i have not done any business with trustpilot .
negative	if they are hired by the company i purchased an item from , then they don_'_t need me to tell trustpilot how good ( or ) bad trustpilot is .
negative	i need to return the part , have tried to get a " so called " support_ticket but have been totally_ignored .
negative	i have tried to call , was on hold for 00_minutes , left message for a call back but no call back .
negative	i will never use this partsgeek again and will tell all of my family and friends to do the same !
negative	delivery was asked for monday_morning , at 00hoo i get an information that a certain flower is not available !
negative	so delivery was not done , plus the person had to go get the flowers .
negative	never again !!!
negative	!
negative	i thought i was making a good deal when i hooked up with parts_geek but i did not know i would not receive all my order .
negative	i tried to get in contact with them over and over but i had no luck so im stuck with a bad_taste in my mouth
negative	their web_site is great good parts cross_reference and no_problems ordering .
negative	this would be a 0_star_review if my order was delivered , but alas i never received it .
negative	thats when my experience with parts_geek '_s poor customer service started .
negative	first there support_ticket form wasn_'_t working for 0 days , when i finally got a request to go thru the auto response told me that they would respond in 00 to 00_hours .
negative	after 00_hours i and no response i went to the postal service web_site and filed a service ticket they called me the next_day it seems that parts_geek had left an old shipping_label on the package with out crossing out the old address .
negative	my order is still sitting in a new_york post_office waiting for partsgeek to contact them .
negative	i did all the work of finding out what went wrong with the order and apparently partsgeek still_hasn_'_t contacted the post_office to correct the problem .
negative	now i received an_email form partsgeek telling_me how to return the part for credit .
negative	someone or someones in their shipping dept needs to be fired .
negative	they sent me the wrong product and sent the other one to a different address .
negative	they are not doing anything to fix the situation .
negative	it just makes me sad
negative	i have purchased from parts_geek before and had no_problems , recently i purchased three items .
negative	i only received one of the three items i purchased .
negative	after the shipping deadline was approaching i looked at the tracking items that did not arrive and they were returned with no notification .
negative	i had to contact parts_geek .
negative	when i emailed customer service they did not try to work with me to get the parts , they told me i will get a refund for the parts but still will be charged the shipping and they would not resend the items because they cannot pay another $ 0 to re - ship it .
negative	" we do not offer reshipment because we would yet again incur 0nd shipping cost thus us paying more on the order than required .
negative	we do not refund initial shipping in order to cover the second charge we took on in the item being returned to us .
negative	you may re order the item at anytime ."
negative	if they are keeping the original shipping cost to cover their mistake how are they incurring 0 charges ?
negative	i spent over 000 . 00 on parts to fix my volvo head problems .
negative	valve , head_gasket_set , head_bolts and radiator .
negative	the valve and head_bolts were right .
negative	head_gasket_set was wrong .
negative	only_thing that worked was head_gasket itself .
negative	all seals were wrong_size .
negative	had to go to parts store to spend more and get right ones .
negative	radiator was totally wrong transmission fittings .
negative	couldnt even swap with my originals .
negative	and radiator didnt have any overflow nipple at all .
negative	totallt not made in it .
negative	these need these .
negative	had to drill my own hole and insert pipe threaded nipple . dont_know how radiators can be made like that ...... over all wasted a lot of time , from wrong cheap parts .
negative	not good deal at all
negative	ordered a regulator wrong one was sent tried to submit a ticket as required have not heard back will never order from this company again beware of ordering from them
negative	i have attempted to bid on this companies auctions on ebay , however , every time i submit a bid , it is blocked by the company .
negative	i have sent emails to them asking the reason i am blocked from bidding on items they offer , and they will not answer my email inquiries .
negative	if they were to have a valid reason , why would they be unwilling to tell me what it is ?
negative	i consider this as an unprofessional business_practice , no what their reasons are .
negative	i have a 000_% positive rating with ebay over the past 00 months , and i pay through pay_pal , as soon as i am notified that i have won an auction .
negative	booking . com '_s ads , like every other site for hotels , air fares and rental_cars , state prices that are nowhere close to the prices you actually get as the real rate , it was just a " come on " to book a room .
negative	in this particular case .
negative	they advertised rooms for $_00 at the jane in nyc .
negative	in order to actually book a room at the jane on the dates we wanted added up to close to $ 000ish .
negative	i tried other dates just to check with both weekday and weekend days and different months ( e . g_., march , june ), and the prices were always above $_000 .
negative	never once did it come_close to $_00 ...... and it never goes below $_000 .
negative	yikes !
negative	raw deal .
negative	please stop making any further contact to this company .
negative	they are a plain rip - off .
negative	they will take your money although they that the had financial problems , and will use your money to simply pay off their debta .
negative	the fine that has_been issued against them is a joke , they took $ 0000 from me alone along with others in this forum !
negative	your chance if you got ripped_off is to get back to your credit_card issuer and issue a fraud claim , you also need to present all email communications and any invoice you have from them .
negative	i wish everyone who was ripped_off to get their money back .
negative	we had many issues and after calling customer service 0 times we had almost finished and the phone_call got disconected .
negative	it was very umplesant .
negative	aa is the worse when you looking to resolve a problem i bought a ticket with the miles and they charge me 00 us dollars but happen a medical problem and i cancel the trip ... when i call for reinstall the miles i have to pay 000 . 00 us dollars .... redeemed 00k_miles and re install is cost 000 us dollars with no travel ......
negative	i spoke to supervisor and she recommend to go to customer relationship and make a complain before to start helping_me ..... is very sad to go to the worse to get help .
negative	waited over one hour for rebooked pick_up to manhattan .
negative	this was after 0 phone_calls to ignorant carmel cars dispatcher who didn_'_t even know what terminal we were in .
negative	told us first time that car would be there in 0 to 0 minutes .
negative	what a joke !
negative	don_'_t waste your time .
negative	dissappointed
negative	ask this lot how to make a washing_machine disappear , its amazing where one can hide .
negative	ordered a washing_machine , and during the checkout_process an extra £_00 was sneaked on - not clear on the website as the header just said free delivery , with no ifs and buts , its a large item and the courier has to charge an extra fee .
negative	thats the point i should have walked away , i hate things like that and that to me is effectively selling under false pretenses ( small_print at the bottom of the page ) - but i ordered it .
negative	due to be delivered on the thursday , the day prior we get a phone_call that we can '_t deliver the machine tomorrow as planned , it will have to be mon .
negative	ok things_happen , at_least we were told so no time wasted .
negative	one day of work on the mon , sit in all day and no machine or phone_call - how to really wind me up .
negative	a phone_call to them reveals that the courier has lost the machine !, this is the point that you would expect any company to do what needs doing to put something right , with some customer service kicking in .
negative	not here , the best that can be done is to provide me the next model of machine and thats going to cost me another £_00 !!
negative	- i dont think so .
negative	after a wrangle and almost involving trading_standards my money was refunded .
negative	i think i have had a lucky esape , there are some really excellent online_retailers out there for white_goods - this lot is not one of them .
negative	do yourself a real favour and steer well clear of this crowd , highly un - recommended .
negative	got the free_trial cd .
negative	carefully read documentation for fees none found documented anywhere , got burned with the pitney bowles offer also $_00 fee after trial .
negative	at_least their offer you got a machine , stamps . com is just free software no equipment required just purchase postage .
negative	willing to pay extra for postage so they can . make some money .
negative	i just print at the most a dozen stamps a month .
negative	going to encardia from dymo like i have been selling to my clients no fees .
negative	even use the stamp printer one stamp at a time .
negative	how can they justify $_00 / month you have to buy supplies and blank stamps
negative	booking process ok , staff helpful enough but due to poor description of rooms we ended_up in a studio rather_than something with a double bedroom .
negative	every other on line provider clearly mentions " studio " in the description for the studio rooms ...... take_care as a " double standard " is actually a " studio "....... certainly took the shine off our holiday !
negative	?................. and to add to it no interest in doing anything about it afterwards ....
negative	to the response below ............ i did report it when on resort and the hotel was fully booked so there were no other options - i spoke with [ private_data removed ].
negative	your customer_services have since responded to say that the " double bedroom " booking was a hotel " double bedroom booking " and a studio is better spec !?
negative	the facility involved only has studio '_s or apartments so for you to not even know what accommodation you are offering your clients beggars belief !!!!!!
negative	they don_'_t even have what you are selling ........!!!!!
negative	!
negative	i ordered a pair of sunglasses .
negative	i paid_extra for two day shipping .
negative	after three_days , i called and found that sunglasses had not been shipped .
negative	the two day shipping only starts when product is shipped .
negative	i asked to cancel order .
negative	the cancelation penalty is 00_%
negative	no cancellation and non_refundable .
negative	remember this !!!!!!!
negative	!
negative	as i scroll_down other messages , i realize that this be must some
negative	type of scam .
negative	the price is great , but double_check your dates
negative	before confirmation & after .
negative	stay_away - stay_away !!!!!!!!!!!!!!
negative	!
negative	i booked a reservation when i arrived at the hotel they had no info of my stay tried_calling reservationcounter . com no answer tried again no answer the room we wanted was sold out !
negative	the lady at the hotel was nice enough to get us a room or else we would have had to sleep in our car .
negative	to make a long_story short dont use reservationcounter . com .
negative	scott
negative	but the part that came was a front break pad .
negative	i '_ll keep it to replace it later .
negative	but i don_'_t want to buy from your company because of inaccuracy .
negative	didn_'_t send the part i ordered and paid for .
negative	didn_'_t inform_me that they don_'_t have it stock .
negative	although website showed that they have it ,
negative	dont use them .
negative	yes item arrived before hand yet poor packaging .
negative	lip of tail_pipe damaged .
negative	i ordered a chiltons book from you .
negative	site said 00 in stock .
negative	received a vague and ambiguous email .
negative	apologies for the inconvenience and my card would be credited .
negative	i called the customer service number and languished on hold for the better part of 00_minutes .
negative	i gave up .
negative	i want the book and i ' d like to know from a human exactly_what transpired .
negative	i ordered a part and send wrong part and was broken after contact wouln '_t change part
negative	when i placed my first order they asked me to confirm my paypal e_-_mail address by sending them a simple e_-_mail , when i did and within minutes i had the code for my games .
negative	however , after telling a friend about the site he was asked to provide the following :
negative	" the most_important information is : name , surname , city you live in , date of birth and expiration_date of your document . "
negative	once you pay with paypal information like this is irrelevant , the site is dodgy even_though it sometimes works i wouldn_'_t trust it from here on out .
negative	i don_'_t really have a bad word to say about gmg , i '_ve been using them since october_0000 and bought 0 games from them so_far , all the keys have been delivered quickly and worked first time .
negative	you do need gmgs software called " capsule " to download some titles but this is a quick install and has excellent download speeds so no_problems there either .
negative	[ edit ] i '_ve decided to lower my rating as two games i purchased recently ( gta v & beyond : two souls ) have not been refunded even_though their support is insisting the refund has_been given .
negative	if this problem is resolved , i will up the rating to 0 * again .
negative	part i bought was a catalytic_converter .
negative	the description on the website says :
negative	eastern_catalytic catalytic_converter
negative	your price : $_00 . 00
negative	qty available : > 00
negative	(> 00 ) in stock
negative	part number : 0000 -_00000000
negative	notes : catalytic_converter -- cherokee ; 00 state universal ; all - w_/ o / 0 port
negative	condition : new
negative	two lines up it says w_/ o / 0 port .... well this catalytic_converter doesn_'_t have an o / 0 port ... customer service said it doesn_'_t say that on their site ... well what i copied here proves that it does or they can '_t read .
negative	so they made me pay shipping return charges .
negative	there is no way to talk to them , only through their website .
negative	terrible !
negative	!
negative	first i ordered 0 part which was listed as having 00 in stock on the website .
negative	two to three_days_later i receive an_email_saying " sorry , that part is out of stock ".
negative	then i ordered ( foolishly ) two more parts .
negative	my order ended_up being split and only one part ended_up being delivered .
negative	two months without resolution thus_far .
negative	in multiple emails ive been told it was delivered via_fedex , others say it was via_ups .
negative	some say it was signed for and left at the door when no one was home to have signed for it .
negative	i have called multiple_times and have waited on hold for 00_minutes only to be hung_up on at the end after a recording comes on saying they are too_busy to answer and to call back .
negative	i '_ve left my phone_number on almost every email_saying to call me to resolve .
negative	nothing .
negative	they even lie in emails saying they call my number and have been unsuccessful in reaching me … yet this is my cell_phone thats with me al the time .
negative	i get many phone_calls and emails for business and i always have it with me .
negative	if necessary , i can provide proof from verizon that this too is a lie .
negative	very poor customer service .
negative	will never buy or recommend this company again … in fact i will warn other to avoid it at all cost .
negative	ups tells_me a shipping_label was created .
negative	that '_s it .
negative	end of the line .
negative	so two_weeks_later when i ask parts_geek " what '_s up ?"
negative	they reply that they will file a claim with ups .
negative	0 - 00 days_later i can expect my refund .
negative	then i can reorder .
negative	really ?
negative	ah , thanks parts_geek .
negative	i made a order on feb_00th and i didn ´ t received it yet .
negative	i asked for information throught the website , with no answers .
negative	a bit disappointed !!
negative	!
negative	i placed and order , they ship with some of the incorrect parts that are not even for the model year of my vehicle , i send a email to customer service , i get a tracking_number for my problem , i wait almost a week now and hear nothing about the wrong parts that i recieve and cannot fix my vehicle untill i get the correct ones , in the fine_print i see that i have to pay the return postage because they shipped me the incorrect parts - do they ( parts_geek ) not take any responsibility for their mistakes !!!
negative	!
negative	000_% percent of the time ive have got nothing but great extremely fast service but this last order will be my last , the shipping which normally took 0 day ( literally ) took almost 00 days and a very important product for my pets skin was out of stock all the sudden 0 days after my order so i did not get that .
negative	i am puzzled as to how they are still in business .... then again maybe it is because of people like me who need a part and can get it no other way ... first you have to dig thru their website to find a number to call them ..( note that you are trying to place an order or in my recent case , trying to get information before returning a failed part )... does that make_sense ?
negative	it is total disrespect of your customer .
negative	after finding a number , it took me 0 days to get somebody to answer the phone .. the only good part of the whole sorry experience was that the gentleman was quite polite , and handled the problem with the necessary skill and due consideration ....
negative	it is highly unlikely they will seeme back there
negative	we had ordered two bottles of inositol and the shipment only included one bottle .
negative	we called and another is on the way .
negative	its a pitty l have to write this as to the point of the return l thought the process ( eg ) website , ordering , payment and delivery was excellent .
negative	free returns in any event was a great touch .
negative	so l had to return a barbour_coat and l allowed 0 days in total so figured this was sufficient time for return and refund .
negative	after 0 days i rang and a very polite man talked me through my return as l was worried that this had not happened , but it had .
negative	he carried on to say that my order was in his tray and the refund was imminent that afternoon .
negative	great l thought only 0 phone_call and everything sorted but as another 0 days rolled by and no refund l used their live internet feed and l must_say not a pleasent experience .
negative	another excuse that its " a very busy time and qoted their returns_policy of 00 days "
negative	so this contradicts what l was prevously told , mistrust .
negative	only after a very hash e_-_mail to complain perfusely about shoddy customer service my refund was finally received .
negative	all in a shame really and l wont be shopping again
negative	i ordered everything i neede to replace the front_brakes on my car .
negative	everything showed_up on time , except for the calipers , of course the on
negative	y parts with a core_charge that they already collected .
negative	so_far after 0 days of inquiries i am no close to having my parts , and no refund .
negative	i am filing a dispute with my credit_card company .
negative	i will never iuse partsgeek again .
negative	was using the envelopes for our wedding 0moro .
negative	just realised they only sent 000 and i paid for 000 .
negative	leaving 0 or 0 out is ok but 00 is terrible .
negative	ruined the theme now .
negative	i saw exactly the dog_food i wanted on the website for a good price , and it was listed as being " in stock " with delivery taking 0 - 0 business days ; so i ordered it .
negative	several days_later , i receive an_email_saying that it was on back - order !
negative	when it finally arrived on the 0th business day , i saw it wasn_'_t the same bag as in the picture on the website .
negative	the listing stated it was a 00 . 0 pound_bag of food , and i received a 00 . 0 pound_bag of food instead !
negative	i should '_ve been notified , in advance , that i wouldn_'_t be receiving what i had ordered and given the chance to cancel the order .
negative	this is a great scam , i wish i had thought of it ( not really ), clone websites with the local countrys flag on it , and local prices , but ship from hongkong anyway .
negative	then what you do is post out the cheap orders like a few pounds , but if you get a decent order , like 00 pound or so , keep the money and dont send the goods , its easy to string them on for 00 days , saying it will get there eventually , then finally , you offer to reship , but that will take 00 days too , and by the time you realise that you have been robbed , its past the 00 day paypal protection , your scammed and there quids in .
negative	of course there are many satisfied customers , of small_amounts , if they were out and out just robbing people it wouldnt be a good scam would it .
negative	they even give out fake tracking_numbers that if you go to hong_kong post , just asks for another number that you dont have .
negative	if on the other hand , you get lucky and your credit_card / pay_pal refunds you , at_least they had a month or twos intrest and it didnt cost them a thing ...
negative	the plot thickens , its 0_weeks_later and the parcel has now arrived , ofcourse thats 0_weeks after i filed a claim with paypal , 0_weeks to send a parcel from hongkong , and convieniently hongkong post dont date there parcells .
negative	i suspect what goes on here , is that they try to get people past the 00 day dead line , but if they fail , they post the goods after you make a claim , it takes paypal 0_weeks or so to deal with the complaint , by which time you have your parcel .
negative	because , believe it or not , hongkong post is actually pretty_damn quick , and it usually_arrives in 0 - 00 days .
negative	the moral of this story is , dont listen to them , if your parcel has not arrived in 00 days , make a dispute on paypal , if its not there by 00 days , ask for a refund , your item will arrive in 00 days of you esculating .
negative	or if you cant be bothered with the hassel , just dont buy from them .
negative	still_waiting for the rest of my order . they sent the gasket but not the pump . i left a message but got no response .
negative	i ordered a badminton bag for my son .
negative	i got a helpful email explaining that my choice was no_longer in stock and suggesting an_alternative .
negative	however as this was a girls bag my son chose another one , the details of which i emailed back to tennisnut .
negative	within 0 minutes i had another email_telling_me that they had dispatched the bag that ' they ' had suggested to me as an_alternative ( the girls one )!
negative	not only was this more_expensive ( removing more money from my card without my authority ) but it has cost me a further £ 0 in return postage .
negative	surely things could be better coordinated
negative	i saw the advertisement for cyber_monday in an_email a few_days in advance .
negative	i decided to put off ordering my vitamins until then so i could get the cyber_monday discount .
negative	when i placed my order online there was no discount .
negative	turns_out that there was a long list of excluded manufactures which of course included my manufacturer .
negative	i decided only to order the vitamins i need right_away with no discount .
negative	unhappy former customer .
negative	the shower panel i purchased was a direct replacement for one i purchased years_ago .
negative	the new panel does not mix the hot and cold_water .
negative	i have tried to calibrate the thermostat mixing value but to no_avail .
negative	e_-_mails sent directly and from their internet site have not been replied to .
negative	i ordered parts rush delivery because i really needed them .
negative	not only did it say they were in stock , but also in transit .
negative	when i checked my emails 0 days_later they told me it was out of stock and wasn_'_t going to be i '_m stock anytime_soon .
negative	the service is awful please awful i hope they diat
negative	this organisation accepted an on - line order on friday 00th , with billing to one address and delivery to a different address , payment by credit_card was taken along with a confirmation_email and 0 - 0 days delivery was quoted .
negative	within 00_hours , the on - line system was showing " items despatched ".
negative	i telephoned to ask when delivery would take place to be told that the items had not been despatched .
negative	i was told that " despatched " actually meant the order had been processed and gone to the warehouse !
negative	the goods would arrive on thursday 00th or friday 00th at worst and that i would get a call from the carrier the day before .
negative	nothing was heard by thursday_afternoon so rang to find out what was going on .
negative	[_name ] took the call and expressed surprise that the goods had not been delivered saying he was typing an_email as we spoke to the carrier and that i would get a call on friday_morning to let_me know what was happening .
negative	no call by friday 00 :_00am so rang bath_empire again and spoke to [_name ].
negative	[_name ] said that the goods had not been shipped and they had been advised that the transaction was fraudulent .
negative	when i said how could that be when i had a confirmation_email that the payment had been taken , [_name ] passed be to her team leader [_name ].
negative	[_name ] continued the story of fraud and stated that they had tried to contact me on monday 00th .
negative	i explained that i did not have any missed calls and even if they had tried , why didn_'_t they leave a voicemail or contact me by email ?
negative	[_name ] said the problem was the billing_address and delivery address was different - i replied that the on - line order entry system clearly asked for both the billing and delivery details and happily accepted the different_addresses .
negative	i was clearly under the impression by now that no money had in fact been taken .
negative	[_name ] said the only way for the goods to be shipped and arrive the next_day was for me to pay by debit_card .
negative	i had very little choice and reluctantly made another payment .
negative	once the transaction had gone_through , [_name ] said " if you give me your sort code and account number , we will refund the original payment ".
negative	i was speechless .
negative	the bottom_line was that payment had been taken , the goods had not been shipped despite bath_empire being contacted on two occasions to see what was going on .
negative	[_name ] said that if i gave the sort code and account number , as a gesture of good will , the money would be paid back into the account that afternoon ( friday 00th ).
negative	i explained that it was a credit_card that was used and therefore the card details were what was required .
negative	[_name ] insisted that i contact barclaycard and get the sort code and account number which out of shear frustration i did - the barclaycard contact mad it very clear to me that bath_empire must use the sort code , account number and my credit_card number as the reference when refunding the money .
negative	i explained this to [_name ] re - enforcing the reference_number issue .
negative	the charge on the debit_card was taken immediately , the refund did not appear on friday , saturday , sunday or monday .
negative	the goods did however arrive on saturday_morning at 00 : 00 .
negative	on monday i rang to speak with [_name ] who said that the refund had been processed on friday and that she would provide me with a document showing the refund details .
negative	when the document arrived , the correct sort code and account number had been used but instead of the reference_number i had specifically given [_name ], the reference was " luxury bathrooms " which is another trading name of bath_empire .
negative	i then had to contact barclaycard to find out what would happen to the refund - apparently , it would be sent back to the originating bank .
negative	however , barclaycard could not tell me how long this would take and that i would have to contact barclays_bank .
negative	i contacted barclays_bank who told me it would take 0 days .
negative	so the situation is this :-
negative	0 ) order placed on friday 00th , payment taken by credit_card and confirmed .
negative	0 ) no sign of goods by friday 00th , told goods not shipped - fraudulent transaction .
negative	0 ) paid again by debit_card .
negative	told original payment would be refunded .
negative	0 ) goods delivered on saturday 00st .
negative	0 ) 0nd payment taken by debit_card immediately on friday .
negative	0 ) no refund to credit_card by monday 00rd .
negative	0 ) unlikely refund will be made before 0th october .
negative	at no time was an_apology made or did anybody accept that bath_empire had made a string of mistakes from the moment the order was placed .
negative	the staff involved were truculent and totally unhelpful , always putting the onus on me to resolve any_problems that occurred despite the fact that all of the problems were of bath_empire '_s making .
negative	make up your own mind .
negative	we spend about £_00 , 000 a year on bathroom materials - this was the first time we had used bath_empire and it will clearly be the last .
negative	i '_ve bought 0 of hudson_reed modern concealed thermostatic_shower faucet dual control [ asin : b000i00xzw ]
negative	none works .
negative	i had to replace them at my expense with other brend cince they were installed .
negative	i am very un happy with your service .
negative	i ordered my part over 0 days ago and it has not arrived yet .... i am going to go to my bank and dispute the charge if the part does not show up soon .... i should have gone to auto_zone .
negative	this wait is not worth the savings ...
negative	my feeling is that the part will never show up ...

negative	my family was coming through lincoln , ne the other night and needed a place to stay .
negative	we were coming through at approximately 0 - 0am and the last thing we needed was a concern about where we were staying .
negative	i accessed the holiday_inn express airport lincoln website and called the number for reservations .
negative	i spoke with a man who identified himself as reservation desk .
negative	i assumed that he was a part of holiday_inn and proceeded with my transaction based on that assumption .
negative	i told_him i needed a reservation for saturday , may 00 and that we would need a roll away bed for my daughter .
negative	my two sons would be sharing a bed .
negative	he said that would be no problem and made the reservation according to my request .
negative	as we were coming through western nebraska , sometime after 00pm , i called the front_desk of the hotel just to let them know it would be closer to 0am that we ' d be coming in .
negative	they had no record of our reservation for that night .
negative	as they checked further , they found that the reservation had been made for the night of the 00th rather_than the 00th .
negative	fortunately they were able to change the date for us .
negative	i asked them about the roll away and was advised that they didn_'_t have roll aways , but suggested that my daughter could sleep on the floor !
negative	i told them i needed to cancel the reservation as we needed a hotel with a roll away .
negative	they said that they couldn_'_t cancel as our reservation had been made through expedia .
negative	they said i would have to call expedia to cancel .
negative	i have no_idea how expedia got involved in this , but when i '_m traveling down the interstate at 00pm in the middle of nebraska i had no way of contacting expedia to try to negotiate any changes in our reservation .
negative	i told the gentleman at the front_desk that i would need a second room for the night since i was not being allowed to cancel .
negative	i asked if they could give me a discounted_rate for the room .
negative	i was told that they could not give me the discounted_rate as my room had been booked through expedia .
negative	they did give me the government discount ( i work for a county sheriff '_s office ) for my second room , but could not honor the same discount for the room booked through expedia .
negative	this was a very frustrating night !
negative	because i was unknowingly dealing_with expedia i was not able to take_advantage of my government discount .
negative	i had to get a second room since i was mislead to believe that they would be able to provide me and my family with a roll away bed .
negative	i am willing to take a little responsibility for not checking my email_confirmation earlier in the day .
negative	i should not have had to make certain the reservation clerk didn_'_t mess things up like this .
negative	the hotel was unable / unwilling to negotiate any further .
negative	this ended_up costing my wife and i $_000 ( plus the $_00 for the second room ) for a six hour stay .
negative	in retrospect , i should have swallowed my loss and continued on to the americinn .
negative	we will not make that mistake again
negative	my first call was to set_up one night in chicago .
negative	i repeatedly asked if the hotel days inn had pick_up and delivery to and from the airport and was told yes .
negative	after calling the hotel for arranging pick_up i was told that they do not have any shuttle service .
negative	i called again and spoke with mike and explained by issue .
negative	he apologized and said he will search for another hotel that offered shuttle service .
negative	he found one and set us up in another hotel for $_00 . 00 more , but could not stop our original reservation .
negative	but promised he would switch me to a customer service manager and they would be able to refund my 0st reservation .
negative	the transfer never happened .
negative	i called back a third time and spoke with oscar .
negative	extremely frustrated and having to explain this situation all over again , he told me that their is no manager to switch me too but he would try to get it handle for me .
negative	after more than thirty_minutes he said he credited my first reservation and would send me a email_confirming it .
negative	still to this day , i haven_'_t received it .
negative	i would like a manager to call me and follow thru with this .
negative	i can be reached at 000 - 000 - 0000
negative	when we booked the car we wanted a reliable hire company so that is why we went with driveaway and hertz .
negative	i wanted a small zippy car as parking in europe at the best of times is difficult but no_doubt more difficult in winter .
negative	parking_spaces are small and tight so you can imagine my horror when i ordered an alpha romeo guillette ( paid more for it ) and received an astra station_wagon !
negative	do you know how hard it is to park a station_wagon in cities like brugge , cologne , paris !
negative	i rang hertz in amsterdam two_days early and tried to confirm the alpha but couldn_'_t get an answer .
negative	i also tried to organize snow_tires ( a requirement in germany ) or even snow_chains but also got a " no " as the answer .
negative	i was quite willing to pay extra .
negative	in the end i paid upfront for the certainty of receiving the car i wanted and paid more for the alpha .
negative	this was a big mistake as if i hadn_'_t paid up front i could have told hertz to shove their astra and tried another company
negative	never again and i will make_sure all the people i talk to about hire_cars don_'_t make the same mistakes i did
negative	ps you guy still owe me a credit as you stuffed up my initial order - but thats another story
negative	what an awful experience !
negative	they bend_over backwards to help you spend your money , but you better pray you don_'_t have to deal with their returns process .
negative	i received a faulty guitar and spent the next two months jumping_through hoops to satisfy their returns_policy , which is just completely ridiculous .
negative	firstly , they ignored my e_-_mails .
negative	it could take them 0 - 0 days to give me the courtesy of a reply , which was usually rude and abrupt ...
negative	they obviously couldn_'_t be bothered .
negative	next , they demanded that the guitar be returned with the packaging it was shipped with .
negative	yeah , that box that you have to rip in order to open it ..... make_sense to you ?
negative	no .
negative	me either .
negative	they actually charged me £_00 for a cardboard_box i could ship it back in , which is pretty ridiculous in itself , never mind the fact that the one they sent me was about 0 " tall and needed a ton of packaging .
negative	they basically sent me any old box that happened to be lying_around .
negative	have i got my money back yet ?
negative	well no .
negative	sent the guitar off a while ago , e_- mailed them about when i '_ll be refunded , and surprise , surprise , no reply .
negative	rude , ignorant and unhelpful , reidy_'_s home of music obviously couldn_'_t care less about customer care .
negative	they claim the best prices in the uk , but it isn_'_t worth the absolute nightmare of dealing_with them .
negative	avoid
negative	despite_repeated messages to customer service , the flowers still did not arrive on time for a birthday .
negative	the whole purpose in ordering an international floral delivery is to get what you want / when you want it !
negative	it is not to ruin special occasions !
negative	i wouldn_'_t bother with these coffe capsules !
negative	allured by the price i purchased 000 , yes they work out cheaper_than the originals , 00p a capsule compared to 00p , but you get what you pay for .
negative	i tried several different blends and every_single one of them was weak and wishy washy , even the strongest and darkets blend .
negative	i informed the vendor and the response i got was very flippant , they basically said thanks for your input and goodbye , poor customer service !
negative	i purchased a pair of oakley off shoot for £_000 from blaze .
negative	they arrived , i liked them , wore them and in the first week the left_hand arm had fallen off a dozen_times .
negative	i reported this fault to blaze and was ignored .
negative	so i elected to return them and demand a refund as the items were faulty .
negative	two_weeks on i have had no communication from them , no apology and no refund .
negative	luckily i paid via_paypal , they are now acting on my behalf and trying to get me my money back , to date blaze have failed to respond to them too .
negative	another retailer who_thinks it '_s ok to take your money and then forget about you .
negative	poor customer service , poor aftercare , poor retailer , avoid !
negative	i was emailed all parts in stock not true wa
negative	told part would be there last thursday not true wanted to use my credit for overbite ship told not to worry well i '_m not very happy with u guys right now
negative	i have yet to understand what im paying for ....
negative	very upset the part showed_up broken and have spent almost thirty_minutes so_far on hold and no one has answer the line yet and i am calling during business hours
negative	i ordered a tail_light_lens_assembly for my truck .
negative	the ordering_process seemed quick and easy .
negative	i scrolled through to find exactly the one i needed .
negative	i ordered it , $_00 and change delivered compared to $_000 through my local shop .
negative	when i received the part in a few business days , i opened it only to find it was a completely different part number and and different lens assy .
negative	than i had ordered .
negative	since i had ordered this off of a web search and didn_'_t have email access , i called the number on the package to let them know of the problem .
negative	that number was to a different company that said i needed to talk to parts_geek and gave_me their number .
negative	i called parts_geek and of course since it was the weekend , they were unavailable .
negative	then on monday_morning i called and was on hold for 00_minutes ( 0 : 00 to 0 central ).
negative	looking at their website , i saw they closed at 0 eastern so i hung_up .
negative	i then clicked on their website for their apparent rga process and filled that all out .
negative	it promises a phone_call / email within a certain time period which has come and gone .
negative	if i had received the correct part it would be fine but the true measure of doing_business with a company is how a problem is handled .
negative	in this case which is my only time dealing_with them , i ' d say i have had a very bad_experience and i would not recommend dealing_with them .
negative	i received a leaking solar heater and still_haven_'_t gotten a response to address it .
negative	i also haven_'_t received my whole order and the customer service couldn_'_t give me a delivery estimate .
negative	this is my worst experience with doheny '_s yet .
negative	i ordered a wheel_bearing for a 0000_honda_accord .
negative	your website recommended the part that would fit .
negative	i took the part into my mechanic ( a relative ) for installation .
negative	the part did not fit .
negative	this website / company does not understand simple business etiquette .
negative	did not honor the sale .
negative	and also did not want to even be flexible and arrive at an_alternative but fair compensation .
negative	they do not take responaibility of their own mistakes .
negative	do not value building long_term client relationship .
negative	i have only started collecting timepieces since 0 months_ago and have built up a collection of 00 watches approx 00 , 000 worth .
negative	and further 00 have passed through my hands as purchases for friends and colleagues of mine .
negative	so instead of potential client for future , they have earned a bad review instead .
negative	really should consider getting schooled on running a business .
negative	i have sent you 0 complaints which you have not even replied back to me .
negative	i think your customer service leaves much to be desired
negative	i bought a year supplement but they sent me for 00 months
negative	twice paypal has ripped me off .
negative	i have sold two items to people in which later they decide they no_longer want .
negative	paypal runs to their needs and does every thing to accommodate to them and refunds their money , even my shipping money !
negative	that is not fair .
negative	if someone buys something , then that item then belongs to them .
negative	now im out all this money and the buyers get to buy stuff , try it out , then decide they dont want it .
negative	its not fair and paypal plays right in to it .
negative	didn_'_t fit and tether was missing looks_like someone tried to cut it down , not worth time and effort for 0 . 00 to ship it back , total piece of junk !!
negative	!
negative	i had google_voice and had no_problems .
negative	gv recently made a change so it was incompatible with my voip box , obihai .
negative	so i was forced to chose a new carrier .
negative	obihai recommended phonepower , and they had good reviews and a good price .
negative	but once switched people started complaining they couldn_'_t understand me - garbled , robotic .
negative	i contacted phonepower , and they blamed my isp , who blamed pp .
negative	so gv was free and worked well , but phonepower made my voip all but unusable .
negative	so i '_m giving up on voip , and going all cell with republic wireless .
negative	not reliable .
negative	person_who is customer rep was so good before order confirmed .
negative	but i recieved order there was some accessories missing .
negative	i called back them to know the reason but they never pick_up the phone .
negative	i baught samsang s !!!
negative	( sthree ).
negative	there was no head phone no box .
negative	they put the phone in delivery box .
negative	i felt this phone was not intact .
negative	before i write this rating i tried to contact them but i could not reach to them .
negative	what ever all number they have online list i tried every_single one .
negative	according to website , order was processed a few_days after submitted .
negative	no delivery or status after 00 days , checking email every day waiting for status but no information provided if order was shipped , or placed on back order .
negative	had to pay repair_shop for a part original ordered from partgeek 00 days ago .
negative	order arrived day 00 to late ,
negative	if parts_geek can '_t hire operators that can understand english then they need to seek help else where .
negative	my problem is an operator that does not understand right from left , this error should not have even occurred as i ordered a right front fender and your operator sent me a left front fender , so i had the truck driver take it back as it was not what i ordered .
negative	but you can make this right with me by sending me the correct fender .
negative	i '_ve been gifted an <_external link_removed_> barred iphone ( shown as lost ).
negative	despite_being barred and despite the <_external link_removed_> merger , i '_ve submitted the imei to this service since they promised to get it unlocked for an_additional_fee , since it was barred .
negative	right now it '_s been almost 0 months , i '_ve spent almost 000euros and still don_'_t have the iphone_unlocked .
negative	when i pose a question to customer_support i get no answer or only after the second or third time ( i '_ve submitted 0 questions in the last 0_weeks without_any feedback ).
negative	before using this service check with people you know that have used it and that have had a sucessfull outcome .
negative	i '_m completely unsatisfied with their performance and honestly i think i '_ve threw away to the trash nearly 000euros ... a bit more and i would '_ve bought a new iphone ( 0s or 0 instead of 0 ) ...
negative	if i had known ...
negative	better luck to all of you
negative	sent the wrong part , expects me to pay the return shipping , won_'_t answer the phone .
negative	avoid this company
negative	they appear to not be anything like a brick and motor company .
negative	there is no support unless via_email .
negative	i think they are the " middle_man " so to speak .
negative	i am now waiting for a parts credit on an order that had missing items in a box .
negative	i fully expect them to deny my return item because the box was short of parts when received , and so naturally the returned will also be short .
negative	this saga is " to be continued ".
negative	this is literally the most pathetic courier service i have ever been across ....
negative	calling yourself a courier is supposed to indicate that you collect something from somewhere and deliver it to somewhere_else in accordance with the agreed service level agreement and allow your customer to track the delivery while it '_s in progress .
negative	the only of these criteria that parcel0go and their partner nightline managed to do , was to collect the package from it '_s requested location .
negative	however , after a week of being boldface lied to by their ridiculous customer service , one of them then told me ( for the first time ) that collection had not been attempted as they were not permitted to collect from airports for security_reasons .
negative	another lie ...
negative	hertz , where the package was supposedly not collected from , has confirmed that on the day in question , a courier showed_up , showed them a docket with my name on it and collected the package .
negative	as soon as they updated the system following collection , my ability to track the package disappeared .
negative	alarm bells went off and i started to contact parcel0go customer_support via their " online_chat ".... every working day between the day after collection i have been told " we have contacted the courier and when they update us with the new tracking_number , you will be sent an_email "... no email .... ever ... then i call them ... and some guy then tells_me that collection was never attempted because they are not allowed to collect from airports !!
negative	!
negative	first of all , i was not advised of this when i initially placed the order , neither by [_name ] who sent me my documents , nor by [_name ] who sent me a following email_stating that my shipment was due to be despatched .
negative	secondly ... have anyone heard of a courier company that can '_t collect from an airport ?
negative	isn_'_t that a bit like a surgeon who can '_t stand the sight of blood ?
negative	either way , i have since being told this boldface lie , re - confirmed with the person at the hertz_counter at cork airport who was present at the time , that a courier did collect the package ...
negative	i do a fair amount of shopping online , so i have a lot of experience dealing_with courier companies ....
negative	this lot of amateurs should not be trusted !!
negative	i have posted this exact_same review on their own website , but seeing how they maintain a 0 . 0 / 0 average review rating on their own website by not posting any negative_reviews , i thought i ' d post it on a few independent sites like this ....
negative	i will never never never even consider_using parcel0go or nightline again , and i will strongly discourage anyone_else from doing so !!
negative	!
negative	update 00 / 00 / 0000 :
negative	over a week since i submitted a claim at the advise of one of their customer service reps . after_submitting the above review , i did receive an_email pretty promptly from a [_name ], who assured me that she was going to get to the bottom of this and would be in touch ..... that was a week_ago ... tried several_times to contact them for an update ... no joy ....
negative	tried their ludicrous " online_chat " support again today .... and was then told that i need to show proof of purchase for them to process my claim ... really ?
negative	they can take my money for a service they don_'_t deliver , take my phone , lie to me repeatedly ... leave me hanging waiting for resolution ... not respond to emails ... and then they want proof of purchase / value of item when i push them to process the claim ??
negative	that '_s fairly rich even for this lot !
negative	!
negative	the parcel in question is a samsung_galaxy_s0 with an_additional 00 gb sd_card in it .
negative	it '_s still in very good condition , even_though it '_s about 00 months old now .
negative	i insured the phone based on what i believe is a reasonable cross - hair between the current value of the phone ( if you buy it without a contract ) and what i would have to pay to buy a new one today to replace it .
negative	first they lied to me and told me that they never collected it , then when i showed documentary proof that it had been collected , now they want proof of purchase / value to pay me what i insured it for ???
negative	i '_m getting tempted to simply call up the police and report [_name ] for theft , as the founder and responsible executive for this lot of idiots !
negative	!
negative	i '_ve emailed a [_name ] today , who is a marketing executive at parcel0go [ private_data ], as his was the only email address i could find , but if anyone has knowledge of the email address or phone_number ( apparently , this company doesn_'_t have phone numbers , except 0000 numbers at 00 p a minute , just in case they haven_'_t taken enough of your money already )
negative	waiting to hear what the next load of nonsense i get from these_guys ... but starting to give up on ever seeing that phone again .
negative	there should be a 0_star option on this website , just for these_guys !!!
negative	!
negative	bought a $_000 worth of merchandise and still_haven_'_t received it .
negative	( ordered on halloween )
negative	this place is the worst parts site ever .
negative	i called for 0 days 00 calls and over 0 hrs logged on hold que noone ever answered .
negative	twice my money was refunded while they had 0 in stock with no explination .
negative	i will never ever ever ever buy anything from them again .
negative	worse experience ive_ever uad trying to get parts
negative	i visited the site as i was looking for a diablo_0 key , there website said they had them in stock and delivery would be instant so i parted with my cash at 0 :_00am on tuesday_morning and went to there key system to get told , " out of stock " i then emailed there support but never got a response till 0am on wednesday_morning while i was speaking to one of them on there facebook_page , i had also just written a review which they have not published as it was only 0_star and no_doubt was deleted .
negative	( you will notice all reviews are 0 to 0star ) i had written in detail my whole_experience with them , i was then told on there facebook_page to " stop posting fake_reviews " even_though i had only posted on there site the disappointment i had had and wanted to warn others .
negative	i have since posted here and on someones blog after_reading the issues he had , had too .
negative	its now been 00hours since my order and im still_waiting for a key i could of brought from a shop within 00minutes or gotten from elsewhere that had it in stock .
negative	the website mis_- informs users from the start claiming they have keys when they do not , then do not keep to there policy '_s one of which says a 00hour wait , another that says we respond to emails within 0 - 00minutes i defiantly will not be using cjs again .
negative	very disappointed with after sales .
negative	i brought a shaft which i was told would fit strait in the head of my driver .
negative	i asked if it needed to be tipped to which the salesman said no .
negative	i fitted the shaft trimming to size from the top as he said .
negative	it performed so bad it was unusable as it was just so soft .
negative	i have been playing for years of low single figures , believe me this was not performing like a stiff shaft ...
negative	it was going so_far right it was mad !!
negative	when i called for help they just stonewalled me ...." nothing we can do once its been used sir ."
negative	all they wanna do is sell shafts and the people selling them dont seem to have a clue .
negative	i am so angry at this company !!
negative	!
negative	your pet corrector is worthless .
negative	i wouldn_'_t refer you to a friend .
negative	i placed a $ 0000 order and 0 - day shipping for headlights .
negative	i got an_email the next_day with a list of instructions telling_me to " confirm " my address with my bank , then submit a customer_support_ticket , then this and that etc .
negative	it was ridiculous .
negative	i can '_t believe partsgeek put all of this on the customer ; there were way too many hoops to jump_through .
negative	despite this , i contacted my bank and went through the steps provided to me in the email sent by partsgeek .
negative	days went by , and i received no shipping confirmation , no tracking_number , and no contact from customer service .
negative	i called partsgeek , but there customer service department consists of a circular " on - hold " system that makes you wait after choosing a menu option ... only to return you back to the main_menu .
negative	after about 0 days , my order was mysteriously canceled .
negative	i just left it at that , and ended_up not giving them my business .
negative	well iv been waiting for my parts did not get them all , i turned in a ticket for some 0 to call me and never did ,, i paid for my parts were are they .. i can go to the bbb and the atterney general in my state ,, call me , i want the rest of my parts .. 000 - 000 - 0000 .. gerald masek
negative	i was booked twice for the same vacation on consecutive_days .
negative	i have called twice and they assured me i would get a refund .
negative	it has_been 0_weeks and no refund .
negative	the service provided is not as_advertised .
negative	the facilities photo is not the same and in addition the facility had no_idea what i was offered .
negative	reservations were not really reservations at all because they could have been sold at any time because the vendor had no_idea what i wished to buy .
negative	the service was prompt but the price was not as you might think .
negative	there is a significant customs fee for shipment to the usa .
negative	that little fact is hidden in the sales conditions section of the customer service info .
negative	it should be more prominent .
negative	do not purchase from partsgeek . com
negative	i needed a thermo switch at a sepecific temperature setting so i located one thru partsgeek which was advertised as the one i wanted .
negative	when the part arrived it was not the correct one .
negative	the only way to contact partsgeek '_s customer service was thru email , i tried to phone them but that was a waste of my time , i was placed on hold after going thru their various number selection then 00 min later given a message that the only way to contact them was via_email .
negative	after filling_out their form i was sent a message days_later telling_me they would contact me later .
negative	a week has past but nothing from them , partsgeek will never get any business from me again .
negative	do not purchase from partsgeek !!!!!!!!!!!!!
negative	!
negative	tracking showed the package didn_'_t leave the warehouse for several days .
negative	as a result i still have no part and i '_m still broke_down .
negative	don_'_t buy anything here unless you want spams about rating them - partsgeek . com and spams about rating their products .
negative	multiple spams in week one , who_knows_how many spams they will send next week .
negative	i hate spam - i won_'_t be back .
negative	i only wanted to make a purchase - not sign_up for spam
negative	the part i received was not as_advertised .
negative	there was no_indication to my while i was booking that i was using some third_party reservation system .
negative	i thought i was using hiltons direct reservation system .
negative	because of your sneaky tactics .. i just got denied hilton points .
negative	thanks a lot .
negative	not !!!!

negative	el valor del ramo de flores y accesorios lo considero de 00 dólares y yo pague la cantidad de 000 dólares , el ramo pequeño , tanto los chocolates como el oso y_la botella de vino eran muy pequeños .
negative	considero que deben ser profesionales y dedicarse sólo a vender flores y hacerlo de_forma consecuente ... para una vez está bien , estoy defraudado y no volveré a utilizar su_servicio , lamentablemente perdiendo se aprende .

negative	i would recommend that people thinking of using this website , find another .
negative	horrendous .
negative	i paid £_00 for a bunch of flowers for my mum for mothers_day .
negative	on the website they lookd lovely .
negative	upon_arrival , there were 0 flowers , and will probably die within 0 days by the looks of them .
negative	and a load of leaves .
negative	i fi wanted to give my mum leaves id of gone out into the back garden and chopped a hedge down .
negative	never using these money grabbing thieves ever again !
negative	i really wish i did more research before purchasing far_cry 0 from uplay !
negative	after a loooooong ass download ( about 00 times slower then it usually takes ) i '_m really pumped to start_playing , but nope .. the game isn_'_t working .
negative	i search for the problem on google and i try everything , and i do mean everything , still nothing .
negative	i go to ubisoft . com where i get even more frustrated , because guess what , you can '_t even send an_email to customer_support !
negative	( i did go to ask a question page , not much help there ) i really did not expect such from a company like ubisoft .
negative	did not reply to emails and when they finally agreed to refund item they did not resulting in me having to make a paypal claim .
negative	also , waited in for an entire day for them to collect item and never turned_up .
negative	i ordered a multi_gym from this company on thursday 00st march , later that day i received an_email slating delivery for wednesday 00th_march , all fine .
negative	sadly , my mother passed_away unexpectedly the next_day , friday 00nd .
negative	due to the arrangements i subsequently had to make regarding her passing , i telephoned on the monday , explained the situation and asked that another day be booked for delivery .
negative	i spoke to a young_lady_who in turn asked , i guess , a supervisor .
negative	he , in no uncertain terms , stated that the date could not be changed under any circumstances as the items were already loaded on the van ( why , as the delivery wasn_'_t for another couple of days ?).
negative	as a result of this and the fact it was a four day week leading up to easter i had to rearange appointments with coroners and the registry office for the thursday .
negative	i waited in on the wednesday for the delivery as requested and imagine my surprise when i was telephoned and informed that the delivery could not be made that day and it would now be thursday " would that be alright ?"
negative	to say i was upset would be an_understatement !!!!
negative	why could the date not be changed for me , taking into_consideration my circumstances but could easily be changed at the behest of this company ????
negative	needless to say the poor girl on the line received both barrels for which i apologise .
negative	so thank_you sport and leasure uk for your total_lack of compassion and understanding making a horrible period in my life just that little_bit more difficult to deal with ..........
negative	ordered parts , shipping status shows scheduled delivery date a week_ago .
negative	emailed and called company , they sent me a return_authorization for parts i didn_'_t receive .
negative	called company , phone tree says you have to submit all tickets via web_site .
negative	first set could not see out of second ones fine third and last set terrible u just cant get it right
negative	i placed the order waited for delivery .
negative	when it arrived it was the wrong parts not the parts i ordered .
negative	so even_though parts_geeks sent the wrong parts , i have to pay the return shipping .
negative	wtf !
negative	it '_s like this they could have sent me a brick instead of the 0000 - 0000_honda_accord timing_belt kit and parts_geeks made it out to be my fault .
negative	really !
negative	the parts parts_geeks sent might as well had been a brick , i could not use them and the return shipping cost me $_00 . 00 to send them back , so maybe parts_geeks will refund my money .
negative	buy anything from partsgeeks again ?
negative	not a chance .
negative	needed a brake_master_cylinder reservoir .
negative	i had to order a brake_master_cylinder with reservoir .
negative	some come with and some do not .
negative	description clearly_stated the way one i ordered included a reservoir .
negative	arrived and no reservoir .
negative	called multiple_times no answer .
negative	opened a online ticket 0 days ago .
negative	nothing .
negative	wasted money .
negative	would never use again .
negative	i ordered a transmission pan , the website said 00 were in stock .
negative	after charging my card a day or two later i get a email_saying that my card is being credited with no explination .
negative	all their numbers direct you to the web support .
negative	a day they respond to say they dont actually have the part .
negative	dont_waste your time with these_jokers .
negative	i have booked a flight for two to buffalo .
negative	ny .
negative	i have been charged on credit_card , but travelocity did not send to my email a confirmation with intinerary just confirmation .

negative	the pruduct was not shipped so i now have a useless item i can pay to return and then pay and try again to get the right item what a joke and very poor customer service
negative	they will not deliver your tickets to you .
negative	i bought 0 tickets to a premier league match for 0 * 000 £ - cat 0 .
negative	when i arrived at london the company had delivered cat .
negative	0 tickets in the away section .
negative	listprice 00 £.
negative	i have tried to get a refund , but every time i phone them they promise that they will get back to me , but they never do .
negative	you will get tired of phoning them before they do and you will never get any promised refund .
negative	f ... ote
negative	no callbacks , no updates , never do what they say they will , lost paperwork , not on time , i had to gather all documentation , and almost damaged my credit from not paying bills associated with my lawsuit .
negative	the worst lawyer - client experience you could have .
negative	my vehicle came back filthy inside and out with mud all all over the carpets and splattered over the vehicle tyres and sides .
negative	it was not delivered in this condition .
negative	on return of my vehicle , it was delivered to me with the overheating indicator flashing the ' do not drive ' sign but the driver had no_issues driving the vehicle in this condition .
negative	i had to be subsequently picked_up by the rac .
negative	i would not use stress_free parking again .
negative	update 0000 :
negative	although a response was posted saying i had been contacted , this is not true .
negative	no effort was made to follow this up at all .
negative	really poor customer service and experience - use at your peril .
negative	these were delivered in a battered box , the flowers were brown and nut like the picture , and the balloon had a large coffee stain on it .
negative	i will not be advising people to buy from you
negative	didn_'_t receive my irder
negative	i needed a drivers outside window seal that runs along horizontally outside the outer body at the point that you would put your elbow out of the open window .
negative	i looked up what i thought was the part on the geeks site and checked with the site through email and was assured that i had found the correct part and ordered it only to receive a body molding that runs horizontally half way up the body of the door .
negative	not the part i wanted .
negative	now i must return this part at my own_expense and hope to get my purchase price back .
negative	my net result is that i spent time and money and received no benefit of any parts .
negative	after_reading some of the other reviews i am not sure i will receive my money back for the part .
negative	all i received was aggravation .
negative	thanks for nothing !!!
negative	!
negative	no way to stop , cancel or change order .
negative	even if a mistake was made entering a part number .
negative	make a mistake and you '_ll pay .
negative	they make_sure to ship your mistake even if u open a help_desk ticket within 0 minutes of realizing your mistake .
negative	then u pay restocking_fee .
negative	help_desk responds only after part is shipped .
negative	no phone_number .
negative	no email address or physical_address .
negative	if you call order number for help , they send you to an extension that doesn_'_t answer .
negative	i was on hold for 00_minutes at 00 am .
negative	no te one excuse
negative	had to dispute charges at visa
negative	my wife and i went to this establishment because we are looking to repair our rv , we are new to the rv culture .
negative	on a saturday_morning we arrived and stood at the front a gentlemen clearly saw us standing there and didnt even acknowledge our presence for about 00_minutes .
negative	he was too_busy closing his several_thousand dollar sale of a tear drop trailer and showed no concern that someone was there to buy or order parts .
negative	he finally asked what we were there for and said to ring the door_bell .
negative	00_minutes later a lady named patty comes to help us , she was very nice and very helpful , we were there to purchase the awning_fabric $_000 plus installation appox .
negative	$_000 , toilet $_000 , and a single step $_00 .
negative	mind you we are new to this and don ’ t know much about brands , measurements and such .
negative	she helped_us obtain all the necessary information .
negative	when it was time to choose the awing color and fitting she told us there was 0 company that made a universal one , but we asked if there was another one to choose from and compare pricing with and a better design she said she would have to open a case with the service department and have them look into it and call me on monday .
negative	patty was a sweet person but seemed a bit overwhelmed so she went to get another lady to finish helping_us .
negative	this person truly had no experience and could not answer any basic questions i had .
negative	she had warehouse person bring out the toilet and steps , patty offered a very functional accessory that we had not thought of and needed ( windshield privacy cover ).
negative	i decided to take the step and compare it to what use to be on my rv lucky i did because they would not have fit .
negative	during the time i was outside the man we had initially encountered rudely told the young_lady helping_us with our order to hurry up because there was someone there waiting to see and probably buy a tear drop and that ordering parts was not her job ….
negative	then who ’_s job is it ?
negative	the young_lady apologized to my wife that mans rudeness , after about an_hour she finally finished our order and drawing up a case so that the service person could call me on monday .
negative	sadly we walked out with only a toilet .
negative	on monday i received no call so i decided to call and speak to someone in the service department , i gave the person my name , information and told_him we had been there and who we had spoken with , he began to ask me questions about the awning size , make and model , he was rude and reluctant to look up the case that had been entered in the computer .
negative	he then went on to say that my rv was too old and that the awing was not made because the company went out of business , i told_him i understand but why did the lady patty offer a “ universal awning ” that she said would fit and was ready to order right there and then .
negative	now he is telling_me that it probably would not fit because it ’_s a different manufacturer .
negative	i tried to reason with the gentlemen to offer me a solution that just involved replacing the fabric … his reply was replace the whole awning , really ???
negative	that kind of customer service just blows me away
negative	the items were the correct ones , but one thing that bothers_me a lot is that i was charged a lot extra to have it deliver next_day and i was aware that the order needs to be placed before 0pm_est which i did .
negative	i did not get my items until 0 days_later .
negative	i called customer service and they were terrible , i was told that i needed to complain to ups and not them .
negative	well once i received my package it didn_'_t say next_day delivery , it said standard delivery .
negative	i guess partsgeek got away with this one but never again will buy from them until they refund my shipping_charges .
negative	temps de_livraison beaucoup trop long . pas_de reprise de pièce électrique dommage
negative	je_ne conseil pas à_mon entourage ce site et_je ni recommanderais pas .
negative	i purchased an item and my account was debited , i checked my order on a regular_basis .
negative	the order said delivery between the 00 and 00th of febuary item ordered on the 0th .
negative	this was a gift and was planning to get it on the 00th at the latest .
negative	i never received the item and when contacting them they explained that it was out of stock , i was offered my account to be credited but i opted to have my bank_account refunded instead .
negative	the delivery charges are too steep for 0 - 0 business day delivery an extra pound with other_companies will get you next_day delivery .
negative	the only positive thing i can say is they answer the phone fairly quickly .
negative	these are a few suggestions tha may sway me to use wae_+ in the future :
negative	0 .
negative	do not take money from account until item has_been shipped .
negative	0 .
negative	send conformation_email for notification of shipment or stock issues .
negative	0 .
negative	apologise to customer .
negative	0 .
negative	incorporate parcel tracking service .
negative	0 .
negative	use alternative courier as ups are not the best by_far .
negative	this was my first dealings with wae_+ and first_impressions are not good i will never use this site again .
negative	this is a further addition to my review dated 00 / 00 / 0000 .
negative	after_reading the latest reviews of others , i am now contacting my bank and will take further actions , i hope i am successful getting this company in public on a programme called watchdog .
negative	it is diabolical that anyone should withhold monies or goods from their customers .
negative	it is theft and fraud .
negative	i ordered a taillight for my truck , the company partsgeek said on the computer that they had it in stock ready to deliver .
negative	then i got an_email_stating it was on backorder .
negative	i had to order from another seller .
negative	i canceled my order from partsgeek and emailed them telling them so , and why .
negative	i would expect much_better from a company that invested so much in customer experience and service .
negative	it '_s been heart rendering having to move away from amazon especially as i had in mind some big orders in the future that are now just not reasonable with fully paid delivery from the amazon warehouse in belgium ...
negative	took my money and did not have part in stock said they had 0 in stock when order and it took 0 days to get my money back
negative	all i require are deals that are pertinent to me ie flying from newcastle , destinations are correct and the price of the deals are suitable for the working man and not just people on higher incomes
negative	i order a part , partsgeek sends the wrong part so i have to pay return shipping ?
negative	i didn_'_t think any business did that these days !
negative	so i pay shipping for original order , pay shipping to return their mistake and then have to pay shipping to have the " correct " part shipped again ? what if they ship the wrong part again ?
negative	no customer service phone_number , it took over a week to get a response ( not 0 - 0 days as they claim ) by email and then they respond with no acknowledgement of their mistake just a return_authorization_number with directions to write this number in marker on the shipping box not the parts box .
negative	problem is , they shipped the part in the original parts box !!
negative	absolute ineptitude .... !
negative	you shipped the wrong part .
negative	your database is not accurate for older_cars .
negative	i have a canon_pixma mp000 printer .
negative	i recently_purchased replacement ink_cartridges ( canon 00 and 00 ).
negative	after installing the color_cartridge the printer detected it was a non_- canon product and initially refused to print .
negative	it produced a popup screen on my monitor indicating that the new cartridge would not allow the printer to detect the ink level in the cartridge , and set the color ink indicator to flashing .
negative	finally it sent a message that if i wished to print without the level function being operative to press the start button .
negative	i did and it printed .
negative	the color was good .
negative	however had i initially known that i would have these problems , and the associated frustrations , with your ink_cartridges i never would have purchased them .
negative	will i be a repeat_customer ?
negative	never !
negative	listed ' the who ' tickets this week via their ' lastminutesales ' process .
negative	followed all their instructions - sent the tickets next_day to them ( signed for )
negative	the all went quiet - no response to emails , listing stuck as ' inactive ' on the site .
negative	emails to customer service bounced .
negative	various calls to their office ( at our cost ) - repeatedly told it will be listed , just takes a while ( eh ?)
negative	finally today told it '_s now too_late ....
negative	0 ) their customer service is awful - no response to emails , phone helps powerless to do anything .
negative	0 ) the website has various bugs / errors ( card details error delayed listing ,' your listing is being modified by another user ' emails bouncing , help form not set_up right , i could go on ....)
negative	end_result - we have no_idea where our tickets are , who has them or how to get our money back - as they never answer
negative	avoid
negative	and weeks_later - no response to any of our emails !
negative	!
negative	updating - it '_s now october & no response to dozens of emails .
negative	not one .
negative	passing to solicitors this week unfortunately
negative	jeg_handler ikke igen hos e_- scarf pga kvaliteten .
negative	this website just links to other_websites like reelvidz or cinemaden ( see other reviews ) but really the same thing .
negative	they pretend to free but charge $_00 .
negative	would not recommend this company to anyone ...
negative	no one ever answers the phone_calls , all you hear is crappy music ans noise .
negative	if you have a problem get ready to get frustrated and upset !!
negative	this company has no personal that you can talk to so you can only contact them by email and they tell you that it can take 00_hours for a response and it will .
negative	after to contact requests they will not allow you to contact them again unless you have a different email and that didn_'_t solve the problem .
negative	i have a number of vehicles and buy parts all the time with good results till i went to these_guys !!
negative	the worst by_far as far as service goes and there prices are the same so if you want to get the right parts with no getting the runaround and 00_% restock plus you pay the return shipping don_'_t buy from these_guys go_anywhere but parts_geek !
negative	!
negative	i ordered parts and they were the wrong parts and wanted to return them and get the right parts !
negative	i put in a request telling them my parts were the wrong ones and wanted to speak to someone to make_sure i was getting the right ones .
negative	no response or a call back so i called them and ended_up getting a recording and then hung_up on . this happened every time for 0 hours so i gave up .
negative	when you return parts they are at your expense so i wanted to be sure the proper parts would be ordered the next time .
negative	i gave up and requested a return order number so i could return the wrong parts and this took days and now i '_m sure it will take a few_months to get my refund less 00_% + shipping .
negative	their return_policy is a joke and after_reading about 000 other complaint s about this i decided that i made a mistake dealing_with this company and should have checked them out first .
negative	read all the complaints when you google parts_geek before you deal with this company !!
negative	buyer_beware !!!

negative	my army daughter & son - in - law purchased tickets from viagogo for tomorrowland in mid july .
negative	they are now reassigned & will not be in europe ( germany ) at that time .
negative	i can '_t find out how to contact viagogo for assistance .
negative	please help
negative	staff was friendly and helpful .
negative	however , i needed progessive lenses in a wrapped sunglass .
negative	when i received my sunglasses , they were blurry .
negative	i took them to my optomotrist to see if the prescription was correct .
negative	it was .
negative	she informed me that progressive_lenses in a wrap are hard if not impossible for some people to get used to .
negative	some never do .
negative	i am still trying to adjust .
negative	hope it works after spending $_000 .
negative	i should have been told about this potential problem .
negative	probably would have gone with a non_- wrap without this issue .
negative	my shipment was lost .
negative	i have tried to communicate with partsgeek but they show no interest in answering my phone_calls or emails .
negative	i '_m lost .
negative	i need my parts and can '_t get them .
negative	it '_s been ten days now and partsgeek will not get back to me .
negative	i don_'_t know what else to do .
negative	if i call the message says they are closed and give me their hours .
negative	according to the rest of the world with the correct time they should be open .
negative	they are not .
negative	i have no other options but to be at their mercy and see if maybe they will respond to my request for a replacement parts .
negative	i will have a problem recommending partsgeek to a friend .
negative	shipped wrong parts , did not respond to two email and one fax messages
negative	if you donot answer my phone you guys can not be my friends .

negative	on the same day i wrote a message to info @ economycarrentals . com claiming that the provider screwed_up the contract and requiring my prepay back .
negative	so , you know what ?
negative	i haven_'_t received it until nowdays .
negative	once again , i wrote a claim to ecr on the same day it happened , e . g_., on the 0th of may .
negative	the first answer from them arrived on 00th of may .
negative	the reply said , they were investigating the case .
negative	the second one arrived on 00th of may .
negative	the content was the same .
negative	strange , but ok .
negative	and then there were silence .
negative	on 0th of june - past a month since i got nothing for my money - i wrote one more message to ecr requiring the prepay back .
negative	the answer arrived after some days , saying " there still no answer from almira " or something .
negative	today it '_s 00th of june .
negative	i '_ve got no more hope to get my money back .
negative	thanx god , that '_s not about the real amount - ' cause the rental had to be for 0 day only .
negative	but anyway , it '_s a good experience , now everybody can be sure : once you paid " a small downpayment ", you '_ll never get it back , no matter if you '_ve got your car or not .
negative	sorry for my weird english .

negative	jag beställde den 0 / 00 en fin rosa bukett till en födelsedag den 0 / 00 , blev förvånad att födelsedagsbarnet inye hörde av sig direkt efter att ha fått blommorna !
negative	blev mycket besviken när_jag får höra att leverans kom den 0 / 00 ...!!!!!!
negative	!
negative	parts_geek is a complete joke , absolutly no customer service , left 0 messages because no one answers the phone , to date still no call back .
negative	don_'_t spend your hard_earned money with these fools !
negative	order never showed and they ended_up canceling it and never even let_me know .
negative	went through bookit . com and tried to book a trip to daytona beach , when i used bill me later option , a bookit . com option to pay it , it charged me 0 times but bookit . com couldn_'_t find the charges for the bill me later account , this happened three_times being the third was booked by a person and not online i was charged_twice . so bill me later said it would take thirty days for the charges to drop_off , i sure hope so what a bad_experience i had and when i asked for a discount for all the trouble i went through none was given what a hassle it was to book a fun trip .
negative	yet another site for the rich and not for the rest of us .
negative	don_'_t advertise a price at one figure and add previously unmentioned " tax " when extracting payment .
negative	you lost me at first attempt .
negative	i actually ordered from brilliance after_reading all of these good reviews on trustpilot .
negative	i '_m now convinced they are all planted reviews .
negative	i purchased a set of their in house certified_diamond earrings and they looked like complete crap .
negative	one was yellow and the other was extremely foggy .
negative	they also shipped extremely late which made it impossible to return them before my girlfriend '_s birthday and purchase another pair .
negative	she had to receive her gift a few_days late this year .
negative	do not buy from these_guys , stick with a reputable local_jeweler or a reputable site like blue_nile .
negative	the book never arrived .
negative	i '_m more than happy to talk about an actual booking , but your system really needs to distinguish the locations of the cities for which one has actually booked .
negative	so , sorry , fellas , i promise i '_ll write a review once i '_ve done the tour in the city that i actually booked your tour !
negative	after waiting two_weeks for my part , i contacted them , and was given a tracking_number .
negative	it told me nothing , so i am just out the money .
negative	will not be using again .
negative	i will never buy from partsgeek i need my money back .
negative	everything was fine as far as the service and price , but the mirror does not auto fold , and it does not power adjust left to right or up and down , it only adjusts corner to corner in a weird angular motion .
negative	now i have to go thru all the rigamarole of disputing the charge , find another mirror , paying another mechanic to swap it out .... i would never order from your company again !
negative	the item is a counterfeit and nothing like the fragrance of the original .
negative	i will never buy from you again .
negative	i recieved the part very quickly which was nice but the electrical connection on the part was not the same at all there for was unusable .
negative	now i am stuck_paying return shipping and still do not have the right part i needed .
negative	i received simcity instead of simcity limited_edition .
negative	here is the answer i got :
negative	" im really sorry for this mistake .
negative	will you accept the key ?
negative	otherwise this cost us a lot of money :( i " m really sorry for mistake ."
negative	buy somewhere_else , this people not doing fair business .
negative	i think that you limit the purchase of cards .
negative	i received half my order , i tried_calling multiple_times and was asked to use the email support .
negative	they will not respond to my emails or phone_calls .
negative	i would not use this company again .
negative	i am robert dispaldo and ordered vanilla hemp_protein but the chocolate is what arrived .
negative	the protein_powder is brown and tastes like chocolate i think .
negative	please_advise .
negative	the label on the container says it is vanilla however .
negative	thanks
negative	robert dispaldo
negative	000 - 000 - 0000
negative	i will not be using this company again .
negative	my order is lost somewhere and they never answer the phone anymore .
negative	i will take my business elsewhere
negative	i watched for vacation for about 0_weeks and when we book the vacation the charge ended_up being for more than was advertised by about $ 0000 .
negative	when i saw it charged to my credit_card i called and the first lady i talked to kept me on the phone for almost 0 hours trying to figure it out .
negative	she told me i was double charged by the airline and i would have to call them to get my money back even_though bookit had sent them my info .
negative	before we were finished the phone_call dropped and i called back .
negative	the second person kept me on the phone for about 0 hours .
negative	he said there was no problem with the air part of the booking and if i wanted to change my reservation the vacation was still being offered for the lower cost however they would charge me the almost $_000 the hotel charged to change a reservation even_though it was still for the same thing .
negative	between the extra money and all the time this is costing me i would not recommend using bookit in the future .
negative	slow or no response to my personal inquiries tells_me that i will not do_business with you .
negative	too bad .... i need many parts here in panama and would have been a good , regular customer .
negative	black xl epson 000 clogged my print head .
negative	voided my warranty and cost me a lot of money .... it also leaked when tape was removed and got black_ink all over .
negative	i placed a phone_call to them and got an answering_machine .
negative	left a message and they did not call back .
negative	very unhappy with product and service .
negative	noticed that most of the favorable_reviews have a single first name and not a handle .
negative	looks_like they are reviewing themselves to get their rating up .
negative	i '_ll retract this review if they call or make good on solving my issue .
negative	will not let you change your order if you made a mistake .
negative	will not answer your phone_calls or messages you leave .
negative	very poor communication .
negative	shop the wrong part even when you tell them it is wrong and make you pay return shipping and restocking_fee .
negative	i will not place another order with them no matter_how low their price is .
negative	buster is a dishonest person .
negative	i am an automotive technician and shop owner .
negative	your prices although are good , you and all the parts_houses on line and now locally are contributing to the demise of the industry .
negative	how ?
negative	by undermining our ability to profit on parts .
negative	an average consumer should not be able to pay the same as a professional .
negative	without the aftermarket professionals the dealer networks get stronger and monopolies get stronger .
negative	eventually putting you out of business as well .
negative	i know the information here is most_likely going to be deleted but you asked .
negative	original message follows_:
negative	“ yuck !
negative	0 . 0_stars rated by priceline , they should be ashamed and fire whoever rated this dump 0 . 0_stars !”
negative	apr 0 , 0000
negative	this is no joke !
negative	the pre paid room through priceline rated at 0 . 0_stars was so bad i let the room go and did not even check into the property !
negative	first off the previous hotel sign when you pull up is completely covered in brown cloth !
negative	we drove past into the parking_lot and saw the signs that had not been covered at the side entry .
negative	they read " the metropolis international " we turned around thinking we were in the wrong place .
negative	we noticed the rooms all facing the parking_lot " very un attractive " with poorly painted dented doors , the kind you see at 00 dollar a night hotels .
negative	we drove up to the lobby and i went inside after looking at the covered front entry lobby sign .
negative	i asked the clerk if i was in the right place , the allure resort ?
negative	he said yes sir , welcome .. to my dismay , i asked_him if i could have a look around .. after a few_minutes of looking at the un kept conditions , the run down pool area , we left and headed to the double_tree at 00000 international drive .
negative	there , we found a truly 0 . 0 plus star_hotel for not much more than we forked out to priceline in good faith for a room at this dump , and i really mean dump .
negative	when i complained and rose the issue with priceline , they said too bad tough_luck !!
negative	never again will i use or trust their service or ratings .
negative	thanks to trip_advisor , maybe someone reading this will not have the same experience .
negative	sent from my iphone
negative	dear priceline customer ,
negative	thank_you for your feedback .
negative	your comments are important to us .
negative	our

negative	original message follows_:
negative	the following comment was submitted via the the priceline group website by james_north [ jmenorth0000 @_comcast . net ].
negative	below is the cut and paste transcript of my first and last time using priceline ever .
negative	in fact , i am so upset i am going to spend more money to stay elsewhere .
negative	it is not fair to have an opaque window pop_up before you bid showing name_brand national brand hotel chains , then book me into something entirely different .
negative	please see below : you have been connected to olga .
negative	olga_: hi , james !
negative	thanks for choosing to chat with us today , how may i help you ?
negative	james_north : i just booked and this was not on the list of hotels , this place is a dump and i cannot stay here , very unhappy olga_: james .
negative	please give me a moment to look up your reservation and get you that information .
negative	james_north : bait and switch james_north : i checked the hotel reviews of the ones on the list and allure was not one of them ,, olga_: james , i '_m still researching your issue .
negative	i '_ll have an update momentarily .
negative	olga_: james , you agreed to stay in any participating hotel that matches your requested star level and area selections .
negative	once you make your purchase online , we immediately charge your form of payment to lock in your rate and secure your reservation .
negative	your reservation cannot be changed , canceled or refunded once it is accepted .
negative	olga_: what i am going to do is to escalate your case to our customer_relations specialist who will follow_up with our hotel managemant team regarding the rating of this hotel .
negative	a member of our customer_relations team will contact you with a resolution within 0 - 0 business days .
negative	james_north : someone_else in our office booked recently reservation number hy0000000000 we were trying to add a room there ar at one on your list but allure is not one of them , we will never use priceline again , it was not on the list james_north : you provided a pop_up list of the hotels , allure was not on the list james_north : i will cut and paste that damn list everywhere along with this bait and switch reservation , i mean it !
negative	olga_: our customer_relations specialist who will follow_up with our hotel management_team regarding the rating of this hotel .
negative	a member of our customer_relations team will contact you with a resolution within 0 - 0 business days .
negative	we can '_t provided you different information at this moment .
negative	james_north : what about the pop_up list that does not list this hotel .
negative	i made my decision based on that pop_up list olga_: you selected a non_- refundable rate where the hotel name is revealed after the purchase .
negative	there is no guarantee that you will get a hotel you viewed during a previous search .
negative	the properties in the disclosed price listings can be different than those in opaque selections .
negative	you were asked to review your reservation , including the terms associated with cancellations or changes .
negative	when you purchased your reservation you agreed to those terms .
negative	if it would help , i can e_-_mail a copy of this page to you for your review james_north : look do you not understand , it said i would get one of the hotels on the list james_north : i need a phone_call from someone in management 000 - 000 - 0000 asap olga_: james , i '_m still researching your issue .
negative	i '_ll have an update momentarily .
negative	olga_: i understand you ' re not satisfied with our policies , james ; however , there is not another department or person that i can transfer your chat to that would address your issue differently .
negative	james_north : you do not understand , i am going to rate this hotel in a negative way and call the manager of that hotel and to loet them know that they baited and switched me then i am going to work art a charge back through usaa and i am going to negative blog your services on trip_advisor etc .
negative	it is not fair that you have some miniscule fine_print to enable your to do this olga_: james , when you booked your reservation , you were able to choose dates of travel , the quality star level , and the zone you wished to stay in .
negative	based on those selections and availability , priceline determines the specific hotel .
negative	once your reservation is accepted it cannot be changed or cancelled .
negative	james_north : do you have a corporate number i can call , this pop_up list does not list this hotel james_north : totally unfair trade practices james_north : you screw people that are in a hurry by presenting a false narrative james_north : you show only name_brand hotels on the list and deliver something else olga_: the only other option i can provide is instructions on how you can email our management_team from our website .
negative	please_note that while concerns sent to our management_team are received and reviewed by executive team_members , a member of the executive team ’_s staff will contact you about your issue .
negative	would you like these instructions ?
negative	james_north : you bet , because i am not staying at the place you baited and switched me into , i will book through trivago or expedia , etc ,, and do as i said , please provide the information .
negative	olga_: you can send an_email from priceline ’_s home page by clicking the “ investor relations ” link in white near the bottom of the page .
negative	after clicking this link , you ’ ll be directed to a new page , and you ’ ll need to click on “ contact us .” james_north : youve wasted much of my time and never again will i use and especially trust anyththing with the name priceline that olga , you can_depend_on !
negative	unlike your pop_up opaques as you call it .
negative	olga_: i am sorry for the inconvenience sr . are there any other questions i can answer for you today , james ?
negative	james_north : no you were not helpful and have no management skills james_north : a polite screw job is all , thanks priceline olga_: thank_you for choosing to chat with us today .
negative	thank_you for using priceline chat .
negative	you may now close this window .
negative	here is a copy photo off my lap_top of the hotels listed on the pop_up opaque list .
negative	you have left me no choice but to launch a negative web campaign against priceline
negative	the priceline group
negative	000 connecticut ave
negative	norwalk , ct 00000
negative	due to arrive at t0 at0 0 . 00 i couldn_'_t get through to the phone_number ( dialing it 00 times as i traveled starting at 00 . 00 ) until i was 000 meters from t0 at 00 . 00 .
negative	at 00 . 00 i rang again and was told that a driver was " on the fourth floor ".
negative	there had been a " problem with the phones " but this didn_'_t prevent you dispatching a driver to be there at the allotted_time of 0 . 00 , knowing that customers could not get through on the phone .
negative	by 00 . 00 still no one arrived and i had to make alternative arrangements ( at a much higher price ) in order to avoid missing my flight .
negative	knowing customers have flight deadlines and time is of the essence it is a totally_useless service if cars are not picked_up on time .
negative	i expect a full_refund and compensation for the wait and the associated stress as well as the additional_cost to me .
negative	not happy at all
negative	i still_waiting from a order placed in 00 / 00 / 00
negative	after a few emails and ansers , still not arrive my book . nothing was done .
negative	today 00 / 00 / 00 arive one order , but wrong .
negative	( prints ) .
negative	i have a custumer waiting + £_000 . 00 of my pocket .+
negative	my reputation to my custmers is important . and you should do the same . i was custmer from jessops in jersey for many_years . now is not the same , pointless carry on as custmer .
negative	i had to reschedule a flight and to get someone on the phone was impossible .
negative	ok .. i booked my trip with bookit .
negative	no problem booking .
negative	they do not tell you that you only have 00_hours exactly to cancel the flights or there will be a 000 charge per plane_ticket fee .
negative	they only price match hotels and not packages .
negative	so ... i booked my package at 0000 .
negative	i then found the same package at orbitz for 0000 within the 00hrs .
negative	they would not match that price .
negative	i called within the 00hr period ... the customer service said there was no supervisor and to call the next_morning .
negative	so , i called the next_morning and was told i was out of the 00hr window and could not cancel the trip without paying $_000 . 00 .
negative	i would have canceled the trip and went with orbitz .
negative	bookit did not tell me any of the vital information until the 00hr period was up .
negative	then they refused the price match .
negative	if i cancelled the trip ... i would have to pay 000 for flights and 00 . 00 for hotel .
negative	very poor customer service !
negative	still not a bad price for the trip though .
negative	ordered online ; completed the payment process ; received order confirmation .
negative	then received email the next_day stating they were out of stock .
negative	i will stick to amazon and play in future - never had any_problems with them .
negative	i know they are refills but when the packaging was opened , there was ink everywhere , all over my hands and very difficult to get off .
negative	will not use them again .
negative	placed order , no delivery and no response via phone or e_-_mail .
negative	avoid !
negative	i ordered my bodybuilding supplements to be delivered to my office last_week , because noone else was home .
negative	after an initial delay , i was finally notified yesterday that my package would be delivered between 0000 and 0000 - swiftly defeating the entire point of having them delivered at the office in the first place .
negative	still , i grudgingly waited_until 0000 and no - one appeared .
negative	i left , then received an_email at 0000 telling_me they were unable to deliver because noone was there .
negative	a suggestion : perhaps if their delivery driver had bothered to turn up at conventional working hours ; let_alone within his allocated delivery slot , this wouldn_'_t have been the case .
negative	dpd do their very best to avoid you talking to anyone on the phone , so despite my attempts to circumvent an_automated voice , i ended_up booking in for another delivery today .
negative	with no confirmation of delivery time by 0000 today , i googled a complaint number and enjoyed being put on wait for 00_minutes of my company '_s time ( i '_m self - employed ), during which time i was fed such dishonest propaganda as , " our faster , most reliable services ".
negative	this statement is entirely incompatible with the absolutely pathetic , hopeless rating of 0 . 0 / 00 on trustpilot , who in their own words describe this as ' very low '.
negative	you are liars .
negative	over 000 people have spoken and confirmed - your company is terrible .
negative	that '_s a fact .
negative	don_'_t try and deceive us and ignore the statistics .
negative	for one delivery , you have wasted 00_minutes of my time waiting for a parcel yesterday ; 00_minutes on the phone last night ; 00_minutes on the phone this lunchtime and a gym session i had to cancel last night .
negative	if i charge you my hourly rate of £_000 / hour , you owe me £_000 . 00 for my time + compensation for my missed gym session .
negative	and don_'_t you dare try and feed me generic , one - size - fits all tripe like ' we ' re sorry we failed to meet your expectations on this occassion ', because the statistics so_far suggest this is something you '_ve been doing for a very long time and that you couldn_'_t care less about fixing it .
negative	ordered a mirror that as it turned_out i didn_'_t really need .
negative	contacted company by email the next_day .
negative	but listed on their site is a strict " no cancellations " policy .
negative	who does that ?
negative	anyway , the order showed to still be " in processing " so i tried_calling them to see if the shipment could be cancelled to save us both unwelcome troubles .
negative	i was put on hold for an endless period of time .
negative	then , as it turns_out , the listed price on the site is not what i was charged .
negative	they charged me more than the advertised price and never even bothered to address that in my emails .
negative	these_people , if there '_s even more than one who works there ,.. need to go back to working the taco bell drive - thru window , because they have no_clue how to run a customer respectful business .
negative	i '_ll never give them another dime of my money .
negative	i '_m sorry i even dealt_with them to the extent i did , what a nightmare .
negative	sears is dupicitous and not trustworthy in its current administration .
negative	i used to buy everything from sears ; refrigerator , washing_machine , dryer , stove , microwave , etc_., but not anymore .
negative	i bought a new forced air furnace from them three years_ago and everything about the instalation , sales , promises , and the appliance was horrible .
negative	the heater sounded_like a freight train was in the house when i turned it on the first time .
negative	it took them six trips back to supposedly fix things , but they didn_'_t .
negative	it '_s still annoyingly loud .
negative	they said they would replace the old asbestos covered vents under the house with new ones .
negative	they did , with the cheapest things available that ground squirrels chewed through with a month , and i had to replace them to another several_thousand_dollars .
negative	and then they said i had a year without interest on the bill , but when the year was up , they charged me all the past interest without informing_me they would .
negative	if you want decent appliances free of hassble and lies , go somewhere_else .
negative	anywhere is better_than sears !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
negative	!
negative	i applied for a loan because i really needed to consolidate some debt and however you made it seem like you helped everyone but that was not the case with me .
negative	i am tired of hitting walls because of an auto note the belongs to my future ex - wife that she does not pay on time .
negative	my credit_score is between 000 - 000 and althought this is not by a great score but it '_s not a 000 ether .
negative	if you look at my total credit profile you will find i pay my bills but you didn_'_t give me the chance to prove myself that i am a good client for your company .
negative	so my review of this company is very low in my books .
negative	sincerly ,
negative	jason romig
negative	i also think that when they saw i was a on a fixed_income from disability and my benefits don_'_t change its also a problem .
negative	extremely slow customer service !
negative	i have tried repeatedly to reach a live_person at parts_geek to request a return_authorization #.
negative	their web_site states that you need to fill_out their on line form to get an ra but after filling_out the form 0 times i have yet to receive one via_email .
negative	when you call their " customer service " ( i use the term with extreme sarcasm ) number their voice_message refers you back the on line form .
negative	they charge a restocking_fee for returns which i would gladly pay but as no returns are accepted without an ra i am not sure where i go from here ?
negative	i would definitely not order from parts_geek again .
negative	i couldn_'_t by some alternators to my dealer , transactions system refuse two times
negative	i was allowed to purchase an out of stock item ........ why not mark the item as out of stock !
negative	and to compound the situation have now asked me to review the purchase !
negative	i was transferred three_times .
negative	long_waits .
negative	rep . could not help me pull up itinerary based on valid number i had on original print out .
negative	eventually had to hang_up due to excessive waiting without help .
negative	issue was not resolved .
negative	very disappointing .
negative	i ordered a watch two_weeks_ago and called them three_times to check order status .
negative	two_days before my departure date ( i told them when i ordered the watch !
negative	), it was finally shipped .
negative	however , the delivery was canceled because it is a wrong one from the factory .
negative	i have very bad_experience with their custom service and will never order from there again
negative	i use to be a big_fan of myprotein and recommended them to all my friends who trained but they ' re not the same company anymore .
negative	you pay for a courier option and they change it without telling you to another courier who can '_t deliver your packages .
negative	ordered on 0nd november .
negative	was told packages dispatched on 0th_november .
negative	still no sign of them by 00th .
negative	tracking hasn_'_t updated since wednesday .
negative	ordered window_vents . none in stock told to try in a week which i did and found that
negative	the warehouse showed seven on hand .
negative	ordered again only to have my order cancelled
negative	again .
negative	very poor control of your inventory .
negative	i will try somewhere_else next time .
negative	travelocity had over charged my credit_card for $_000 in may 00 00 for a carnival cruise from charleston , my id # 00000x00000x when i was booking on the phone and looking at the same wed page with their travelocity expert agent .
negative	it was $ 0000 . 00 .
negative	unfortunately !
negative	after the cruised , when i checked my credit_card statement , that showed $ 0000 . 00 charged .
negative	i called , emailed , talked to manager ... all of them are end up with ; it is fine , just wait , we worked on it .... until now they never credit back to me and try to deceive , bully , cheat to me .
negative	everybody plz be carefully when you book with travelocity . com .
negative	i am un satisfaction their service .
negative	very disappointed .
negative	eight days have gone by and no product has yet to arrive here .....
negative	i ordered rx_sunglasses an i got them shipped to my house .
negative	when i opened them , the glasses where so cheap that one arm broke .
negative	cheap plastic ....
negative	costumer service did not handle well my issue but the product is very good .
negative	i only gave one star because of the costumer service , the product is excellent if this were to be only product review i would give it 0_stars .
negative	went to local store for yellow building sand could not see any asked at counter was told it was on shop floor so i looked again still no luck so asked another member of staff and was told they not only don_'_t sell it there but never have so i phoned next nearest store 00 miles_away and was told it was in stock so drove there only to be told by a they don_'_t do it either and never have so not only i don_'_t have my sand i did a 00 mile drive for nothing staff on phone either lie or have no ides what they sell i will never use these incompetents again
negative	completely not what you expect when you see online .
negative	they post fancy pictures with models and photoshopped .
negative	color and the look of the items are complete off and they photographed items in their best angle , hiding their ugly & unattractive sides .
negative	if they say your items are in stock , they are actually not because they are an empty company , which when you order the items , they go hunt for you and delay your shipment .
negative	it took them a month to ship my items .
negative	they do not refund your money back , but instead refund in their credit , forcing buyers to buy more sucky items from their website .
negative	shipping is also not refunded when returned ( please read their policies carefully ).
negative	if this still doesn_'_t stop you from buying items from their website , then good luck to you !
negative	do not use these dudes , they are very bad people .
negative	my daughter was stranded 000_miles_away from home .
negative	i went to partsgeek . com to order the oil_pan she ruptured .
negative	i requested overnight delivery , and even called the salesmen on the " 000 " number to confirm it would be shipped immediately .
negative	after i went to the " checkout " and paid for the product , the disclaimer popped_up " will ship in 00 - 00_hours ", which was too_long for me to wait for an 00 year_old girl away from home .
negative	i immediately went online to cancel the order , and called the " 000 " number to confirm the cancellation .
negative	of course , neither did any good and partsgeek shipped the part anyway .
negative	i took a huge financial hit as i had to pay the overnight shipping and restocking_fee for a part i cancelled within 00_minutes of ordering it , and because it did not disclose that it could take 00_hours to ship after i ordered the part .
negative	i am a very poor man with very little money , and this experience hurt my family and me .
negative	i plan on contacting the better business_bureau to help me recover my lose .
negative	these_people track your ip_address and try to steal information from your computer . they are tied in with hackers . they say it is free but they are trying to get info from you .
negative	we ordered a full size family van , to accommodate 0 adults as well as luggage for each ( at_least 0 suitcases ).
negative	when we arrived at_gatwick airport on our ba flight from tampa , we did not have a full size van , but a smaller van into which we had to cram 0 adults , and carry luggage on our laps .
negative	i did not order this on the internet , but spoke to one of your representatives on the phone .
negative	either he was new or didn_'_t know what he was doing .
negative	as a result , don_'_t count on or business in the future .
negative	you will not have us as a customer in the future .
negative	my optometrist beat their prices , the shipping was extremely slow is it took 00 days to receive my frames , way too much spam .
negative	die inforamtionen bie den verfügnbaren flügen waren unvollständig .
negative	es sind flüge nicht angezigt worden , die bei anderen firmen ( konkurenz ) buchbar waren und somit haben_wir einen terminlich schlechteren flug gebucht , obwohl es für uns bessere varianten gegeben hätte .
negative	dies unabhängig vom preis , wir hätten sogar mehr bezahlt , wenn wir kenntnis gehabt hätten !
negative	so kann_man sich nciht auf das system verlassen !
negative	worst on - line seller i have ever_dealt_with .
negative	received confirmation of my order , then waited 0 month .
negative	no book , no response from dualj to my inquiries nor my request for a refund , so i filed a complaint with paypal .
negative	seller didn_'_t respond to either paypal or to me .
negative	paypal resolved complaint in my favor and credited my account .
negative	i have since seen numerous similar complaints against dualj .
negative	i wonder_why paypal hasn_'_t closed their account and how they are able to remain in business .
negative	we booked our room online a week in advanced for an overpriced amount of $_000 then when we checked in to our room they needed our debit_card for "$ 000 " security deposit which it fine .
negative	the following_day i happened to check my bank_account was charged $_000 .
negative	my issue is that day we were going to a theme park so fortunately we had the extra funds but what if we needed those funds for our plans that day .
negative	you can '_t just charge people amounts to they ' re card and not let them know especially when you have already paid for your room .
negative	i give an f letter grade for everything , fedex never gave_me my part i never received it i '_ve been waiting ever since , please contact me i need to know what will happen .
negative	i ordered a hardtop dolly for my 0000_jeep_wrangler and the one they shipped is for 0000 or prior .
negative	there is no phone_number to call them .
negative	emails take 0 days for a response .
negative	i have asked for someone to call me but have still not gotten a call and it '_s been 0 week now .
negative	they sent me an_email_telling_me that the part i need is $_00 more ... no apology for their mistake and i have to pay to ship back the wrong part that they shipped me .
negative	i will never do_business with them again .
negative	produkten som_jag beställde var tydligen slutsåld .
negative	jag_fick bara ett mail att ordern var annulerad , inget erbjudande om någon ersättningsprodukt .
negative	ordered part on a monday 0 / 00 received it on friday 0 / 0 .
negative	this is not acceptable shipping time !
negative	when ordering description was much_better that actual product .
negative	email stated product shipped took almost 00 days .
negative	very flimsy product .
negative	ordered different one from other supplier came in great .
negative	will not use parts_geek in the future
negative	i ordered a water_pump over two_weeks_ago .
negative	i received a tracking_number but product was never picked_up .
negative	i have filed several claims and have yet to talk or be contacted by anyone .
negative	i should have gotten a set of two but only received one .
negative	i logged a complaint .
negative	customer service was slow to get back to me .
negative	they indicated the vendor would make it right .
negative	have not received a refund nor the missing part .
negative	have not heard from anyone in about a week .
negative	been 0_weeks now they gave_me a duplicate code i emailed them once every 0 days asking if i could get a update and they just ignored me and took my money .
negative	do not deal
negative	doesn_'_t communicate well .
negative	i bought a counter strike + 0 games key over 0_weeks_ago and they just keep on saying wait for the autokey_system .
negative	they tell me that it '_s restocked and i go and check less_than 0 hours after they told me they stocked 00 keys and all of them where gone which is pretty bs considering that there are altogether 0 reviews on the single game .
negative	i send a ticket asking for a refund after the 0 week mark and they ignore me .
negative	they usually responded within 0 day at max telling_me to wait but now it '_s been 0 days + since i asked for a refund and the continue to ignore me .
negative	i write on their facebook_page and they completely ignore me there too .
negative	doesn_'_t open at all
negative	i am a business_owner this transaction was failed because i had the customer enter his info via my mobile_device through my invoice asap portal .
negative	at the time the transaction processed fine , it wasn_'_t until much later that we found that they canceled the payment !
negative	after much hoop jump we finally got an answer to why the payment was canceled and it was a tos issue .
negative	i would not recommend this company .
negative	dont return your e_-_mails and they dont pick_up the dam phone !!!!!!
negative	!
negative	the selected garage have no customer care , failed to complete the works , damaged my wheel , wasted my day how ever the customer care shown by paris at black_circles was exceptional as was the follow_up support .

negative	very slow " production ".
negative	ordered necklace 00 days ago and status has never changed .
negative	sent them an_email and have yet to hear back from them .
negative	this type of service is unnacceptable !
negative	!
negative	as soon as i received my $_000 + order , two of the cartridges were leaking ink .
negative	after installing a set into my hp0000 , i was still unable to print .
negative	the printer still said it needs new ink .
negative	i immediately contacted inkfarm .
negative	after finally agreeing to send me replacement cartridges ( this was not easy ), i am still_waiting for delivery .
negative	it is over a week now since the first cartridges were installed .
negative	lucky , i was able to use another printer .
negative	the service and product so_far have been very disappointing .
negative	i am debating whether to just send my entire order back .
negative	no matter what the price , they have to work and be receptive to your needs , the customer .
negative	if i made the mistake for a customer of mine i would send another out right_away and when the original shows up i would pay to have it returned to me .
negative	not make customer wait .
negative	thanks for the help .
negative	i contemplated ordering this part from partsgeek or having a local store order it for me .
negative	i gave in to the convenience of home delivery and a small savings .
negative	i ordered a windshield reservoir tank and received a coolant_reservoir tank .
negative	now , due to absolutely no fault of mine , i have to pay to ship the wrong part back to new_jersey and i still don_'_t have my part .
negative	the response time of the online customer service has_been very slow as well .
negative	too many other choices out there to put up with poor service .
negative	due to a recommendation on line by the company , i did not choose the site i wanted .
negative	due to poor policy .
negative	i could not reverse this .
negative	poor performance and a site i will not use again .
negative	i purchased a promo item of 0kg total protein , dpd next_day delivery .
negative	the item didn_'_t arrive at my house 0 days_later , and only because of my prompting via phonecall !
negative	i also received a 0 . 0kg amount rather then 0kg , due to the promo offer apparently running out of stock !
negative	i was never informed of this , i only found out when ringing up enquiring the whereabouts of my items .
negative	poor service .
negative	every order prior to this transaction has_been absolutely perfect , this time however , it turned nothing_short of farce .
negative	my compensation was a voucher which merely covered the price difference_between the promo offer and a 0 . 0kg sack of protein .
negative	no refund was offered on the delivery , regardless of it arriving five days after the said delivery date .
negative	very poor service .
negative	i received my bumper in a week from ordering it .
negative	the only problem i had was it was missing a passengerside bracket to mount it .
negative	their where supposed to be 0 angled brackets an was missing it .
negative	i had to use the old rusted one since i had to get it mounted .
negative	check your parts list before you start !,,
negative	virgin river hotel crummy and we did not stay after entering our room .
negative	one star_rating !
negative	!
negative	amazing customer experience .
negative	order on the 00th of march on a next_day delivery service .
negative	no delivery on the 00th , no delivery on the 00th , no delivery a week_later and actually no delivery at all .
negative	just had to pick_up my parcel from a bunch a clowns who had confirmed the next delivery while the item was not in stock while their confirmation_email was saying item dispatched .
negative	i imagine that the problem lies more with the seller rather the delivery company but i '_m just a bit suprised to be asked feed - back about a delivery which never happened and was a particularly bad customer service experience .
negative	first_impression is very good , but they don_'_t do any maintenance of the property .
negative	consequences : elevators out of order , no carts available and if there are carts available , you have to call the office and they will responde in about 00_minutes .... floodings in the basement are considered as normaol as there is no maintenance of the pumps .
negative	i could never get any human to speck with .
negative	i was sold a defective_part that failed as soon as it was installed , and i cant get anyone to talk to return it .
negative	ordered $_000_dollars worth of parts .
negative	my shipping and billing addressed are different so they canceled the order .
negative	tried to resolve it with multiple phone_calls to which no one ever answered .
negative	also tried their online customer service with no help at all .
negative	very unhappy
negative	i found the same item at another online business for cheaper nd wanted you to match the price .
negative	i was given a bunch of malarky from your c / s dept .
negative	about not matching the price , so i told your company that i will not do_business with you ever again .
negative	i '_m happy with the end_result but each cap that i pulled off was full of ink !
negative	i blotted each pad with paper towel before inserting it into it '_s slot .
negative	i was able to clean up the spilled ink and my hands with purex .
negative	i have never experienced such a mess with other cartridges .
negative	please_let_me know if there is a special procedure one should follow .
negative	i was very careful when i got to the black_ink !
negative	bill
negative	passed on wrong arrival time to car_park operator ( purple_parking meet &_greet ) who subsequently levied a no - show charge .
negative	provided wrong drop_off instructions ( lhr t0 ).
negative	ordered a part for a 0000_mazda 0 ls and received a grill for an 00 .
negative	packaging was terrible , box was way over sized for the part and had no bubble_wrap or anything around the part , just bouncing_around in the box , now i have to pay to ship it back ..................
negative	ordered a week and half ago and still no delivery .
negative	my reviews will be wherever i can broadcast them , in all media , and among everyone i know .
negative	the whole insurance thing is a rip - off .
negative	never , never again .
negative	we bought the premium insurance package with auto - europe , and understood there would be a deductible .
negative	at the avis_counter in dijon , the clerk said outright , " you have no insurance ."
negative	what an appalling lie .
negative	we bought the extra coverage -- ten_percent for one week .
negative	on returning the car , the agent marched to the back bumper , found a 0 cm .
negative	scratch , and charged us a $_00 administrative fee .
negative	obviously that '_s the phony scratch that '_s always there , on every rental_car , to charge unwitting customers , one after another .
negative	we will be contesting this with our credit_card company .
negative	goodbye , auto - europe .
negative	you deserve to go out of business .
negative	and goodbye avis : after 00 years of renting primarily with them , we will find other agencies both at home and abroad .
negative	i purchased tickets from new_york to montreal on saturday through flight_network .
negative	saturday - i booked tickets on saturday around 0am .
negative	sunday - i saw that my tickets were not ticketed and the american_airlines website listed them as status unknown .
negative	i called flight_network and was told to call american_airlines .
negative	upon speaking to american they said that the tickets had not been properly requested by flight_network and i would need to deal with fn directly .
negative	i called fn for the second time and was told that because this was a special fare the transaction would go through by the end of business on monday .
negative	monday - i called fn around 0 : 00_pm and again after 00pm and was told that my tickets were still un - ticketed but they would certainly be there by the end of the night .
negative	tuesday - i called fn in the morning and they told me that everything necessary was with american_airlines - that my credit_card was charged and that the tickets should be here shortly .
negative	i got the direct extension of the representative .
negative	but he was not at his phone for 0 hours of intermittent checking and when i called the general line i was placed on hold for 0 . 0 hours !!!!
negative	i was told me my ticket would be issued today .
negative	( the same thing i heard each of the previous days ).
negative	when i asked that the ticket be issued while i was on the phone , since i don_'_t want to wait another 0 . 0 hours on hold , i was told that she could not accommodate that request and that i would receive my ticket today .
negative	the same exact message i had been getting since saturday .
negative	and still no ticket !
negative	wednesday - i woke_up and still had no ticket four days after booking .
negative	i had incurred expenses in montreal and wanted to make_sure i had a plane_ticket to get there .
negative	i waited on hold for another 00 + minutes - only to finally receive an eticket from another third_party ( not flight_network or american_airlines ).
negative	the fn site still doesn_'_t show my ticket .
negative	this is completely absurd and as a first time user of flight_network i can say that i am extremely disappointed .
negative	i should not have to act as the liaison between fn and the airline .
negative	my tickets should have been received within 00_hours of ordering .
negative	i should not be expected to hold for hours .
negative	in the end it took over 0 days to receive an eticket , countless_hours on hold , and the stress of not knowing if my ticket would ever come through .
negative	totally disappointing .
negative	completely inept
negative	they lie in order to book rooms , was promised a $_00 dollar credit on one occasion and was lied to on another about hotel location and convenience .
negative	they tell you what you want to hear to get rooms booked in my honest_opinion .
negative	its expedia for me from now on
negative	0 orders have not recived either order but did recived return_label very quitly plus u did take my money very quitly not very happy at all iwould like this matter resolved 0 my satisfaction please order #_0000000
negative	despite_being " in stock " at the time of order , 0_weeks_later not a sign of the clubs or my money back .
negative	this is the second time i have tried unsuccesfully to order something on this web_site .
negative	i took this product because i heard rogan rave_about it .
negative	i started out with 0 tablets for the first week and felt nothing .
negative	second week i increased to 0 tablets and still feel nothing .
negative	wasted money but it was worth a shot .
negative	oh well .
negative	this site is full of crap ....
negative	i ordered my book and paid_extra to expedite and get my book sooner .
negative	i was not home to receive the shipment so they ended_up sending the book to the fedex office all the way in mount vernon ny , mind you i live in the bronx , nowhere_near mount vernon ny .
negative	i attempted to have the book resent to my job but they would not let_me cause bookbyte would not allow the book to go just to any fedex , they had it setup to go only to that location which is way out of my way .
negative	soi still_havent got my book i paid for and i cant even get in touch with bookbyte staff to solve this issue .... i recommend do not order your book here , they suck and have no consideration and you would never get in touch with them .......
negative	this the worst experience i have ever had with a motel .
negative	i did not stay at this motel because the a /_c was not operational , the door would not lock , the tv set looked like it was built in the 0000 '_s and it was filthy and smelled_like crap .
negative	when i contacted your people yesterday , i was told that the motel would not refund my money and i would have to contact the motel personally to resolve the issue .
negative	the motel manager just argued with me and said that he did not take my money , you did .
negative	let '_s get to the bottom of this before i have to result to drastic measures
negative	i '_ll start by saying i was immediately suspicious when i received no email_confirmation after purchase .
negative	then , after receiving a battery that would not mate with my computer ( it was advertised as a " lenovo battery " - even says it on the invoice - yet it ’_s a knock - off , imitation product ), i attempted to be patient and went through the website to inquire as to how to get a replacement or have my money refunded .
negative	i did this twice over a two week period .
negative	after not getting a response , i then called the number listed on the site and left two increasingly frustrated messages ( both during their alleged " business hours ").
negative	i actually got a reply to the second message - oddly after their listed business hours and strategically placed during rush hour on a friday , so i wasn_'_t in a position to take notes or , for that matter , pay close attention since i was rushing to catch my train .
negative	on that call , however , i was told that my money would be refunded and that an_email with instructions for returns would be forthcoming .
negative	it has_been exactly a week since that call and neither the refund nor said email have materialized .
negative	so , i just left a message ( the second of the week ) informing laptop battery hq that a ) i will be filing a small claims_court claim against them ( yes , i '_m willing to fly to nyc for $_00 since i travel for work all the time ) b ) i am going to make it my mission to spread the word across the internet about how poorly i '_ve been treated ( i even plan on starting my own , exclusive , anti_- laptop battery hq blog for which i can probably parlay my many national media contacts to cover as a sort of " you '_ll never believe what this guy did " story that often makes people laugh ) and c ) i intend to call both their numbers ( 000 - 000 - 0000 , 000 - 000 - 0000 ) to leave long , rambling messages every_single day until i , the customer , am granted my rights to obtain a refund and return the item .
negative	so , thanks laptop battery hq , i appreciate you giving me a new focus for the time being .
negative	even_though your shitty battery didn_'_t work cuz it was a cheap imitation of what you told me i was buying , this will work out really well for me in the long run .
negative	by the way , anyone out there who is looking for this company , the address listed on their website is , not surprisingly , non_- existent .
negative	if you want to pay them a visit in person , i suggest visiting : 000 corporate way , suite 0 - 0000 , clarkston , ny 00000 .
negative	of course , their facebook_page lists them at " 000 redondo brach blvd , gardena , ca " which is , in reality , 000 redondo beach blvd , gardena , ca 00000 ( 000 - 000 - 0000 ), though the company listed on google at that address is named k0h group , inc .
negative	either way , that makes two false addresses ( one on their home site , and the other on their facebook_page ) and three different phone numbers .
negative	if you need to return something or get any information you ’ ll have big problems .
negative	i needed to return a sink & tap set due to my kitchen plan changing unexpectedly .
negative	these things_happen in building .
negative	firstly , taps uk ( utsumi ) charge 00_% restocking / handling_charge plus you pay and organise delivery .
negative	although , when i went to check this i could not even open their terms and conditions on their site .
negative	( i still cannot at the time of writing this )
negative	to get to the point where i actually knew how to return the goods i had many emails back and forth with this company .
negative	based on the replies i received , which had no relevance to the query i was asking , i believe they were not even being read .
negative	if you have ever spoken to a call_centre where the person does not understand you and just replies something unrelated back ; you ’ ll find this is 00 times worse .
negative	i finally gave up and picked_up the phone to call their extremely expensive premium_rate number ( which they will probably make profit from ).
negative	i spoke to a “ manager ” who looked through my email exchange .
negative	he agreed it was unacceptable .
negative	he said he would sort this out and call me back .
negative	the promised call back never came .
negative	i finally followed the return instructions and paid parcel_force to deliver the return .
negative	it was a signed for delivery in mid december and am still_awaiting my refund a month later .
negative	i have had to resort to getting the proof of delivery from parcel_force .
negative	but the problems started well before this though as they could not give me delivery time information .
negative	i raised a ticket on their enquiry system and got a useless generic / automated reply .
negative	this whole_experience has_been absolutely awful and unacceptable .
negative	i will never again use this company : tapsuk or any other utsumi brand .
negative	you can make your own choice .
negative	my important plans were ruined because of this joke of a website / company .
negative	i made my booking the evening before and everything was going smoothly , after completion you get a message_saying that you will receive a conformation_email .
negative	i got no such email and after 00_minutes decided to phone up to double_check .
negative	i was on hold for 00_minutes and then the line went dead .
negative	called again and was on hold for 00_minutes and the line went dead .
negative	decided to call back the next_morning .
negative	not very good .
negative	their website says customer service is open 00_hours a day ...
negative	after i got through the next_morning they said the branch is closed and that i need to wait_until 0am to see if i could get a car or not .
negative	at 0am they called me and told me the branch is not open on sundays .
negative	00_minutes later they told me that the branch does in fact open at 00am and i that i should phone up and book directly with that company .
negative	i can understand that branches have different opening times but why does their website allow you to book at car from 0am when the place does not even open until 00am .
negative	very misleading and i was not able to get to my destination on time .
negative	had the website not lied about being_able to get a car from 0am i would have been able to make other arrangements .
negative	overall , i would give this company a rating of " needs to be flushed down the toilet ", but for the fact that the toilet would probably get clogged and i would need to call a plumber .
negative	my parts took a week to get to my home and that '_s just not acceptable .
negative	i can order parts from ohio and get them in 0 days .
negative	not coming_back !
negative	they sent us the wrong part .
negative	they do not answer their phone or return emails .
negative	now we have to pay to ship back the wrong part !
negative	save_yourself the aggravation and order from a reputable_company !
negative	when my printer died , i bought another .
negative	having dealt_with printerinks before , i phoned them and politely asked if they would credit me with an unused , sealed cartridge from the previous printer and they agreed .
negative	they didn_'_t !!!!!
negative	the colour cartridge that duly_arrived for the new printer didn_'_t work ,- it took multiple e_mails and phone_calls to get them to credit me with the ammount it cost .
negative	they blamed my printer and then said because i had broken the seal on the cartridge they couldn_'_t refund so do not believe a word of their 000_% guarantee .
negative	i am absolutely sickened by this company and will never buy anything again ever !!
negative	incidentally , i purchased a replacement cartridge from amazon ,- perfect !
negative	printerinks are on a par with bob the builder on a bad day !
negative	!
negative	sw refused to price match gaspari protein from bodybuilding .
negative	com , after i had them on the phone and proved to them it was a verifiable price the still refused .
negative	quoting " we cannot match a sale price " on top of their highest price shipping .
negative	worst company ever .
negative	going back to bodybuilding . com
negative	problem wasn_'_t with order or receiving parts but rather after receiving parts and discovering the wrong part was boxed and sent .
negative	customer service is impossible to contact by phone leaving you only emails every other day or when they feel_like it .
negative	they also want me to pay for the return shipping for their mistake .
negative	a week after_contacting them the wrong part still sets on my desk no closer to any resolve .
negative	see_above .
negative	no further comment .
negative	very easy to arrange delivery of items , but no matter_how well they are packed they still arrive damaged .
negative	this is where the problems start .
negative	it seems that most items are not covered by the insurance that you pay extra for , why do the take the money from you when they know this !.
negative	it is almost_impossible to contact them about problems , no phone_number , difficult to find " live_chat ", very difficult to download all the evidence of the damage .
negative	i am sure they do this on purpose so that you just give up , i am also sure that they should be reported to trading_standards .
negative	my first order was nothing_short of a disaster .
negative	i canceled my order and they were still dumb enough to send me an_email thanking_me for my recent_purchase .
negative	do not buy
negative	i would never purchase from this site again !
negative	all was well through the ordering_process , i ordered a taillight cover for the passenger_side of my 0000 charger .
negative	i got the order in about a week so i was very pleased with the speed of it getting here .
negative	i very excitedly opened the package only to find that they had sent me the driver '_s side taillight cover .
negative	which was okay , i figured i could just send it back and receive a new one quickly ..
negative	i filled_out the form to get the rma_number so i could return the product .
negative	told me to wait 00 - 00_hours until i could get a response .
negative	when i did , they just told me they ' d credit my account .
negative	not what i wanted , so i had to fill_out another ticket to tell them to call me or send an_email with clear_instructions on how to return the wrong item .
negative	now i have to wait another 00 - 00_hours to get a response .
negative	how hard is it for them to tell me exactly_what i need to know to get this done !!!!!!!!!!!!!
negative	i would call them , but there '_s no number for me to call for this type of problem .
negative	i have emailed them , but there '_s no clear response there either !
negative	i will never ever use this company again !
negative	i ' d hate to have to go through this nightmare again !
negative	how hard is it to return a part or get a clear response ?
negative	i strongly_urge others to turn back and go somewhere_else , because if you get the wrong part , good luck on getting it back and getting the right part to you !!!!!
negative	!
negative	they sent a wrong part and i have to pay for the return shipping .
negative	it is a nonsense .
negative	i have to pay for their mistake .
negative	part had terrible quality anyways .
negative	i am never buying anything from partsgeek . com again .
negative	i placed my order , they charged my card , they cancelled my order - took three_days for the money to get put back into my account - sounds_like a scheme to me !
negative	it would have been nice to know that my order could not have been fulfilled before they charged my card .
negative	i had shopped_around to find the best price for the parts i needed , but wound_up with no parts and no money for three_days .
negative	ended_up buying from my local_autozone for a higher price , but dependable service !!!
negative	lack of parts and money was a big problem - i needed my car up and running asap !
negative	i posted a negative_review about a company ( amoma . com ) and had it removed .
negative	i was asked by trustpilot for documentation that i was a customer and then asked by amoma for proof of our dear friends death .
negative	nonetheless my review was removed .
negative	i wonder_how long this one will last ...
negative	i paid for a non_- refundable hotel reservation in nyc to attend a wedding well in advance .
negative	we experienced a death close to our family and now have to cancel the reservation .
negative	amoma says ' no , sorry non_- refundable '.
negative	the hotel says , ' sure we could easily resell the room if you released the reservation .'
negative	so i am out $_000 for a room that will sit empty in nyc but could easily be resold .
negative	how is that good business ?
negative	message : book directly with the hotel .
negative	this is an intermediary that adds no value or customer benefit to it '_s users and adds risk to your reservation .
negative	delivery was a nightmare
negative	on line price for 0 phones accepted , both phones immaculate .
negative	when received envirofone said there was a software problem on the blackberry for which they cut the price of this phone by over a half , absolutely ridiculous .
negative	i had the misfortune to order a shower_valve from this company on 00 december .
negative	they were 0 of 0 potential suppliers of this valve that i found on the internet .
negative	i needed the valve quickly and i asked the first supplier if they could assure delivery in 00_hours – they replied they could not .
negative	i then rang bathshop000 who confirmed that if i ordered that day i would receive in 00_hours .
negative	accordingly i ordered on wednesday 00 dec at approx 00 : 00_hrs with a delivery date of friday 00 dec .
negative	i received an_email at 00 : 00_hrs on 00 dec advising that my order had been dispatched .
negative	it did not arrive on friday 00 dec .
negative	i rang bathshop000 on monday 00 dec to enquire where my item was , i was advised that they could not contact their supplier but had left a message for them , they would also email them and that i would receive an update on 00 december – no update was received
negative	on 00 december i rang bathstore000 again and was told that their supplier was now not working till 0 jan but that they would put a provide me an update on 0 jan when their supplier was back at work – no update was received on 0 jan
negative	today 0 jan – i still have not received my product , even_though the money was taken on 00 dec , and when contacting bathstore000 again today was simply told that their supplier had lost my order and that it will be dispatched today for receipt tomorrow – i wait to see if this is another commitment that bathhstore000 have made that they will not meet .
negative	however , this would also seem to indicate that they have not contacted their supplier before now , otherwise “ the loss of the order ” would have been discovered earlier ?
negative	i cannot express how frustrated i am with this company , i have only awarded 0_star because i cannot award any less – i urge all potential_customers to avoid bathstore000 even if it means paying more – it is simply not worth the hassle of dealing_with them !
negative	i will not buy from them anymore , i learned my lesson , cheap does not mean better .
negative	i called and i was not able to talk to anyone , i opened a ticket and no one emailed back .
negative	i have a part to return and i '_m not getting through to anyone .
negative	the worst service ever .
negative	everything seems to work fine except the wireless handheld mic .
negative	have tried everything but to no_avail .
negative	when sent back they wouldn_'_t pay for shipment .
negative	not a respectful company .
negative	will not do_business with them again
negative	after a lengthy search for a large sissy bar bag i decided on the viking vk - 0000 - s .
negative	the bag was promptly shipped and received .
negative	when i secured the included roll top bag using the sewn - in clips i discovered that one of the clips was never sewn closed .
negative	i contacted viking bags , told them of my issue and they offered to either pay the $_00 to have it sewn by my cleaners or they would replace the roll - top bag .
negative	they requested i complete their on - line form and i was given a case #_00000000 and signed by their representative , ed watson stating he would immediately respond .
negative	since then i have called and emailed them with no response .
negative	i notified them that i was leaving for a motorcycle trip on june_00th so time was of the essence .
negative	again no response .
negative	so i guess i will have my cleaners do the sewing and take it on the chin .
negative	as we all know , bad_news travels faster_than good news .
negative	i hope that viking will " step - up " and do what is right because i have nothing but time and will_continue to post negative_comments which in - turn will cost them more in lost sales than if they were to just do the right thing .
negative	would not order anything again frpm them
negative	it is getting worse by the day .
negative	you can '_t even reach anyone and the staff all get_rid of you to a different dept .
negative	and no one to really complain too .
negative	it is so bad now that i can '_t get my furniture fixed after delivery and no one will tell me why i have not got my rewards for spend thousand of dollars annually .
negative	they are robbing us blind .
negative	simple : ordered last sunday ( paid ), scheduled to monday .
negative	today is friday and nothing .
negative	nobody replied my messages .
negative	so , i lost 00 euros .
negative	the hotel did not have my reservation upon_arrival .
negative	i usually use kayak but travelocity had a special so i booked through them instead .
negative	i '_ve booked the same hotel through kayak before and not had any_problems .
negative	i paid for service today told to call to give more info to access my info and can not get an answer on this service for me this is horrible customer service take your payment and not allow you to get thru to give the info needed to access the service you just paid for would not recommend this to anyone
negative	wanted my refund back but they didn_'_t have didn_'_t have my information needed for my refund .
negative	poor service and organization
negative	i ordered the purple shorts after getting the email regarding sale prices .
negative	everything is fine until the following i get a notification to say there isnt any stock .
negative	in the mean time all other items i was interested in have sold out .
negative	real time stock notification would be good .
negative	i used travelocity . com to book a hotel .
negative	the hotel did not provide the services that i paid for .
negative	i contacted travelocity . com while at the hotel .
negative	the travelocity . com employee denied being_able to find the letter travelocity . com emailed to me that described the services .
negative	the hotel denied providing me with the services clearly outlined in the letter .
negative	later , when i contacted travelocity . com about this issue , travelocity . com did nothing to provide me compensation .
negative	i would not use travelocity . com again .
negative	i would not stay at that hotel again .
negative	horrible return_policy .
negative	restocking_fee unacceptable and just_plain robbery .
negative	will never recommend .
negative	i purchased items with a order and confirmation #, purchase amount cleared american_express ... then puff ... within 00_minutes i received an_email_stating the parts purchased were unavailable and my credit_card would be credited , which should take 0 - 0 days depending_on my credit_card company .
negative	it would be nice if you would check inventory before taking my money and keeping my company '_s credit_card amount frozen for the 0 days for your lousy inventory system .
negative	this wil be the only and final time that my company and any clients or friends that we inform will purchase items , where our money is held captive for 0 - 0 days after only 0 minutes of you verifying ordr and parts .
negative	get your inventory and site of purchase under control ..
negative	it '_s easy math ... items in stock 0 ... purchase 0 .. take 0 off inventory .. receive charge authorization .. send item .
negative	not take money ... no item ... wait for your refund in 0 - 0 business days .
negative	ordered a few parts and card came back declined which was a problem with the bank .
negative	the problem was when i tried for over 0 days to call and contact thru the web_site .
negative	never an answer either way too_busy for the customer .
negative	took business elsewhere

negative	merci govoyage !
negative	i ordered a 0000_honda element tail_light .
negative	i got a 00 - 00 eg civic headlamp .
negative	you can not call them because they say that they are busy .
negative	you email them , and they never email you back .
negative	i wish i just paid the extra money and got it from the dealership .
negative	if you can , and i see no reason_why .
negative	never shop_here .
negative	i spent a week trying to get a simple question answered due to the way your communication is setup .
negative	you have no way for a costumer to communicate by phone .
negative	yes you have a number but i tried for a week and it was a joke .
negative	then i started the online ticket system and that is time comsuming and was and has_been a waste of time .
negative	why because when after over a week i did get my question answered the answer was a lie and the parts where wrong .
negative	being the past manager of a large automotive_parts department its obvious to me the person that answered the support_ticket did not go back and check or call the manufacture or do anything to truthfully answer my question .
negative	they just assumed and made a quote most_likely because they where to busy .
negative	this experience with partsgeek has_been very bad and has cost me three_weeks of lost time in getting the parts to repair my dangerous to drive vehicle .
negative	i have placed a hold and dispute with my credit_card company until someone calls me personally and we can resolve this problem without_any added expense to me over and above what i was quoted $_000 . 00

negative	i ordered three parts .
negative	a washer_pump " brand vdo " which is the oem part for my car .
negative	i was shipped a washer_pump from continental some knock_off brand and charged the price of a brand_name .
negative	that is fraud .
negative	secondly , i ordered an air_filter , it came as ordered .
negative	i also ordered a cabin_filter .
negative	i was shipped another air_filter and this one does not even fit my make or my car .
negative	in order to get reimbursed i would have to ship it back at my cost and pay a restocking_fee because they shipped the wrong part .
negative	i will never order from them again .
negative	i never got to speak to a person and only got computer automated email responses .
negative	i truly hope they go out of business because they are ripping off people who trust a professional looking website .
negative	i am not sending back the part .
negative	i am eating the 00 dollars on the cabin_filter because i have read enough reviews online to know it is a waste of time and more money .
negative	if i could give a minus to flightnetwork i would .
negative	i booked a ticket to travel to curacao 0 months_ago , just to find out in the very last_minute , right at the airport , that the airlines they sold me a ticket from , does not exist .
negative	what that heck is wrong with you guys ?
negative	and when i called then they told me that it was not their fault , that this things_happen all the time and that i should call my credit_card to get my money back .
negative	i '_m trapped in florida and my vacations are ruined because of this poor company .
negative	do not buy from flight_network , it i the worst travel_agency .
negative	this is a response to your response ( the one below ):
negative	that is totally not true , i have not been contacted by any of your representative , my phone is working perfectly , but of course not in miami because my phone is from canada .
negative	i did not even receive an_email and you do have indeed my email address on your files .
negative	you guys got me waiting 0 times in 0 different calls , none of them with a positive response .
negative	i will absolutely put this through my lawyer , it is a really bad customer service the one you offer , when you wash your hands by just saying that you were not informed , that is absolutely not my problem , you are indeed responsible on this matter , you don_'_t even show respect or care for the customer , you did not even consider that we are trapped in miami neither you offer a solution to this absurd problem .
negative	definitely not worth to deal with such a bad travel_agency .
negative	paid nearly_£_00 for some roses that looked like they ' d been bought from the local_garage !
negative	will not be using you again
negative	i went to buy a cd_key from this site and got a blurry one and i couldnt make out the letters and numbers , so i made a ticket to contact support .
negative	got a response a day later which was fine saying they would fix it , 0 days_later i hear nothing from them and my order hasnt been completed .
negative	so i send out another and another associate takes my ticket and says they will fix it and still nothing .
negative	so_far its been 00 days since the original ticket and i feel_ripped_off .
negative	looked up the part by make , model and year and when i got it it was the wrong part .
negative	very disappointed still_waiting on the little refund i '_ll get after shipping_charges .
negative	you would think if you give the year , make and model it would be the right part but no it wasn_'_t .
negative	i clicked on a link to book my reservation , and trusted the site link to the hotel i had chosen .
negative	the link took me to a hotel of the same name just wrong city , state / providence , climate , and country !
negative	i didn_'_t realize this mistake as it had the correct address when i selected my room details , but the final reservation could barely have been more incorrect .
negative	as i was charged for canceling my reservation within hours of making it .
negative	next time i '_ll just use some other means of placing a reservation .
negative	i no_longer trust bookings . com !
negative	i have yet to receive my merchandise .
negative	not even a tracking_number !!!
negative	!
negative	received goods that had already been sent out to a customer before and they had returned them with marks on and human hair was found on the product .
negative	i received these goods in an unfit state for resale so why they were sent out i will never know .
negative	i was offered i replacement with a 00_% reduction , on an item that i had just payed £_000 for , not acceptable .
negative	massive company with big sales and profits but once sold dont care less in keeping the consumer happy .
negative	i used to be a big superdry fan but will never purchase their goods again .
negative	shambles
negative	i tried phoning as requested , but the phone was off .
negative	after 00_minutes of calling and no answer i was at the airport waiting and wondering what i was going to do !
negative	finally someone answered and was not very sympathetic to my stressful situation .
negative	half an_hour later someone arrived to take my car .
negative	it was slightly better on the way back .
negative	i was told the car would be with me in 00_minutes .
negative	00_minutes later my car arrived .
negative	check the small_print .
negative	i returned a pair of shoes that were no where near the dimensions of the manufacturers stated pricing guide .
negative	i then had to pay for millets initial postage_costs .
negative	not really free_postage then .
negative	ordered flowers for my mother , did not arrive .
negative	second time this has happened .
negative	i had to contact them to find out what had happened .
negative	i used the online_chat_function and had been told there was a technical difficulty with my order , no offer of goodwill etc .
negative	disappointing !
negative	we booked the ramada_inn in cumberland md .
negative	the ramada_inn is right beside a main train hub and trains blew their whistles all night .
negative	the trains were right beside the hotel and it was very loud , making it impossible to sleep .
negative	travelocity did not send me a form to review the hotel .
negative	when i contacted travelocity , they told me it was impossible for me to review the hotel because the review form is computer_generated .
negative	i suspect they are protecting the hotel , and causing people have a terrible hotel experience .
negative	really , really unhappy with my bookit experience .
negative	started with the reservation process .
negative	my wife and i wanted to visit our son in nyc on the night of sept . 00 .
negative	through google i ended_up at your site .
negative	placed a reservation for laquinta on w00th street for that night … or at_least i thought i did .
negative	saw two_days_later that i had a reservation for the night of sept . 00 ( tonight ).
negative	i assume it was " my bad ."
negative	the error cost us about $_00 more for the night .
negative	roughly_$_00 for cancellation and then a confusing reason for the rest .
negative	upon_arrival at the hotel on the morning of sept . 00 to drop_off our bag , we ' re told by the front_desk that they were not paid by bookit .
negative	the credit_card number bookit provided didn_'_t work .
negative	they wanted my credit_card and instructed me to deal with you .
negative	they said they were unable to find a helpful person at bookit .
negative	i asked them to try again as we set out for a full day of business and family in manhattan .
negative	at around 00 p . m . we arrived back at the hotel .
negative	issue still unresolved .
negative	i did not want to give them my card because i feared i would be double charged .
negative	i called bookit '_s customer service line and was put on hold for 00_minutes .
negative	yes , thoroughly exhausted and sitting in a lobby for almost 00_minutes while my cell_phone battery drained to single digits .
negative	at that point i used my wife '_s phone to call bookit again , and a more helpful representative resolved it with the front_desk within 00_minutes .
negative	the cs_rep said it was a hotel issue .
negative	the following_morning a front_desk manager said it was a bookit issue .
negative	she explained that you '_ve recently gone_thru some kind of it upgrade and guests there have experienced the same problem as we did .
negative	at this point i believe her .
negative	i make what i believe is a reservation for the 00th that i later see is for the 00th , and pay $_00 for the error .
negative	if the hotel manager is correct , what is bookit '_s restitution for their error ?
negative	i posted a complaint on another public site and received an_apology and request by bookit '_s social_media team to write them with more details .
negative	i did it and did it again .
negative	not response .
negative	they act like they care on public sites but that couldn_'_t be further from the truth .
negative	stay_away from these_guys !
negative	i ordered online with ava '_s .
negative	price was attractive ( if you ignore the exhorbitant delivery fees ).
negative	i now know the attractive price was due to the pathetic condition of the flowers recieved .
negative	they were so bad as to be almost comical .
negative	i have suggested to them that they consider at_least a partial_refund .
negative	if so , then i ' d be happy to reconsider my view of them .
negative	based on some of the other reviews , i won_'_t be holding my breath .... or reccommending their service to anyone_else .
negative	you sent me a defective_part i then had to purchase a replacement and then when i was credited for the defective_part you did not credit me for cariage as a catering equipment services company we buy a lot of pumps needless to say we will not be buying them from you
negative	this is not really a surprise .
negative	i kinda was waiting for this to happened i '_ve been buying auto_parts on line from geek without_any_problems other than taking too_long for delivery .
negative	but what is happening right now tops it all .
negative	i order four items and they split the delivery three in one and the other one in a separate package .
negative	well , the fourth part never got delivered .
negative	had to buy it from another_vendor because had to fix the car and i could not wait for them to send it or delivered it .
negative	i notify them of the mishap and they took their sweet time to get back to me and they send an authorization for the return of the part , how do they expect me to return a part i never got , besides i do not want to return the part , what i want is for them to deliver the part that i bought and payed for .
negative	that is what is happening with them geeks , i '_m very disappointed at them i think this is the last of my orders .
negative	labels products as being multi_- language and region free when they are infact not .
negative	i will never be able to trust purchasing a key from them again .
negative	hopeless support , i '_ve sent 0 unanswered emails as well as completing a survey about the customer service without getting a word back .
negative	avoid this website .
negative	all the 0_star_ratings came in as a result of them offering free games if people reviewed them on trustpilot .
negative	use at your own_risk !
negative	i ordered a fog_lamp for my pontiac vibe .
negative	the part was poorly_packaged for shipping and arrived broken .
negative	i sent the part back with a note requesting replacement over three_weeks_ago .
negative	i have heard_nothing from partsgeek .
negative	i wish i had spent the extra money to get the part from a more reputable auto_parts supplier .
negative	even if i eventually receive the part , the savings were not worth the headache .
negative	one of the sales_reps is rude and condescending ( older gentleman with mustache , i think he is the manager ).
negative	ill never by parts from parts_geek
negative	it is more than two_weeks that i am waiting for my parcel to be delivered in italy and i have no news no even an_email .
negative	this is not a good service .
negative	pietro zucchetti
negative	when i arrived on the page that led to my reservation , i thought i had arrived at the hotel '_s own reservation system .
negative	there were no indications whatsoever that i was on expedia and if that is not deception , i don_'_t know what is .
negative	i have had one nightmare after another using third_party booking services .
negative	when on the ground , in one of these properties , you have zero options since your stay has_been paid for and there is no chance for a refund if you leave .
negative	i thought i was getting_rid of expedia a long time ago , when i landed in new_orleans just ahead of katrina .
negative	the hotel that i booked closed down and because i paid for my trip using expedia , there was no refund on the three or four days that i had to find a different hotel in houston tx .
negative	imagine my horror when i arrived to find out that not only did i not use their reservation system , but the payment went to expedia .
negative	i was a bit perturbed , to say the least .
negative	got your catalogue with someone_else '_s name on it but my address emailed u to check what was going on heard_nothing wow what a service i certainly won_'_t be using u or recommend u
negative	keine meiner 0 bestellungen ist bisher angekommen !

negative	b_&_h raised nikon prices within 00_hours of the tragic japanese tsunami .
negative	what an insult to all those_who lost their lives .
negative	it '_s been a week and a half since i ordered my parts from your company ( partsgeek . com ) and i had no response to my website inquiry , no customer number to call , pep_boys has now ready to tow my car since these parts have not arrived !!!
negative	what is going on !!!
negative	is this website a hoax or what if i don_'_t get this soon i want a refund !!!
negative	or you will be dealing_with my credit_card company . this company is terrible !!!
negative	do not purchase anything from this company .... please
negative	ordered four items for my car , but only received only three .
negative	contacted their customer service and they insist they shipped everything right !
negative	still trying to get them to issue a refund for the missing part .
negative	i have found it impossible to get a vat_invoice / receipt for my hotel booking .
negative	i '_ve also been hounded with spam email .
negative	will not be using easybook again !
negative	the insurance is useless unless you have money for a doctor '_s visit and only practice american medicine .
negative	i practice ayurveda ( oldest and most complete medical system in the world ) and because there is no doctor in my area i am unable to get a refund .
negative	i can put a thermometer in my mouth , underarm , ear , etc .
negative	and tell i am sick .
negative	i do not need to spend more money to tell me something that is obvious .
negative	buy your tickets straight from an airline and you will not have these problems that this evil middleman creates .
negative	if i was writing to a friend and he or she gave_me the service i just encountered , then i would no_longer consider that person my friend .. i found both expeireinces to be horrible .. it '_s as if you had robots reading off of cue cards ... and extremely hard to understand ...
negative	i am a minority as far as ethnicity goes but at_least i can speak_english in a understandable manner .. just horrible service ...
negative	i made a reservation for a car for my stay in honolulu thru rentalcars . com .
negative	i go to the booking company at the airport and they tell me an international driver '_s license is required thru rentalcars . com even_though i recently_moved from hawaii and my driver '_s license is from the state of hawaii !
negative	the rentalcars . com international phone_number on the voucher does not work which i try to call from the booking company .
negative	when i get to the hotel and connect my laptop to the internet to get more rentalcars . com contact information , i get thru and i am told " it is my 000_% loss "!
negative	i ask to speak to the supervisor and i am told the supervisor was already consulted .
negative	all i have to say now is nice scam rentalcars . com !
negative	i was looking to replace my glove box light in my 0000_vw_jetta .
negative	i did a search on the site for my vehicle and noticed the picture was wrong but i had everything correct in the search fields .
negative	so i sent customer service a email .
negative	i asked if the photos for vw glove box lights were just a stock photo .
negative	because i also noticed that all of the shown lights were the same for all make and models .
negative	customer service conferring that was in fact a stock generic photo was used and as long as i set my correct vehicle year make and motel the correct part will ship .
negative	well it did not and now i have to pay shipping back to get my refund .
negative	complete_waste of time and money .
negative	i probably will not order from these_guys again for the fear of the wrong part being shipped .
negative	i was disappointed in the car that we had .
negative	euro went to hertz which we are a gold_member and they were given our number .
negative	when we went to get our car we were given a ford_focus while our friends who were not gold members go an audi .
negative	could not figure that out .
negative	will go directly through hertz or budget next time so we have a say in the vehicle rented .
negative	this has taken 0 month you shipped me the wrong part twice and you have not refunded my money back yet .
negative	doubt very much if i ever purchase anything from you again your policy of refusing to offer a telephone_number so you can talk to a human is poor . how can you stay in bussiness the computer does not answer your questions . luis j arango .
negative	you would think in the current business world you would be told sooner_than 0 days that the parts you ordered we ' re out of stock , especially if ordered on line with a return email address .
negative	meanwhile my truck is still sitting in the driveway waiting for my current order of parts to come in , from another_vendor .
negative	thank_you for the huge delay .
negative	i received a free membership to identity_guard via my purchase of zone alarm .
negative	while the membership is free for a year , i get bupkus !
negative	nothing for free for a year isn_'_t what i expected .
negative	the only_thing i did get was lots of sales_pitches for all the other services that identity_guard provides .
negative	so after purchasing my key for cod_black_ops i followed every instruction on how to activate the game via a russian vpn .
negative	i come to this stage and find that the cd_key is invalid , i try again and same problem .
negative	after about 0 tries with different vpns i decide to contact support , what a horrible fucking experience !
negative	the support agent responded extremely slowly and told me to try again , i did so , to find out the key was a duplicate !!!
negative	by this time i was extremely angry so once again i contacted the support_team , they told me to disable steam guard and supply them with the account credentials so that they could activate it for me , i instantly thought " hold on a minute , the cd_key is duplicate ?
negative	did you steal the cd_key ?"
negative	and then it came to mind he was trying to steal my steam account too .
negative	i made a move to try and catch this idiot out , i told_him that he can have access but under no circumstances would i disable steam guard .
negative	in response i was told that it must be disabled for them to activate it , now as you may know it takes no_longer_than 0 minute to type in the steam guard code but after explaining this too him he had no valid reason_why it was not possible with steam guard activated !, i then told them that i am taking this into paypals hands and reporting a hack attempt of my steam account , it was no suprise that they did not want this and lets just say they responded with some speed !
negative	heres what they said :
negative	" dear michael
negative	there is little reason for your aggressive attitude .
negative	we have tried to offer assistance to you in the quickest method possible .
negative	the only other option i have is to request information from the supplier .
negative	we have absolutely no reason to believe the key is invalid and in fact have had no other reports from the many , many keys we have sold .
negative	the options we offered you were genuine and i can_assure you that cjs does not run any scams !
negative	i will now contact the supplier and request information about the key .
negative	we are questioning our suplier and
negative	will provide you with a resolve as soon as possible .
negative	we will respond to you in the shortest time possible .
negative	due to the high_level of tickets it would be useful if
negative	you did not reply or write any further tickets whilst
negative	you are waiting for the resolve .
negative	i have marked your account awaiting pickup whilst we
negative	sort this problem .
negative	your patience is sincerely appreciated .
negative	cjs appreciates your custom ."
negative	a paypal_dispute has_been opened and i have taken screenshots of the whole communication with this awful website .
negative	keep away from these !
negative	advertised " free shipping " but as you finalize the order you realize there are strict limits , and you guessed it , you have to pay .
negative	i ordered a $_000 dollar radiator , it was packaged in a thin_cardboard_box , that was barely sealed .
negative	it was apparent that the box had come open in shipping , and the radiator had been severely_damaged .
negative	this begins the nightmare ; it has_been two_weeks since i ordered the part , still no satisfaction .
negative	i will not use part_kings again , as they treat their subjects as third world peasants .
negative	no_idea what they ' re doing ..
negative	i ordered a $_00 dollar part , paid the freight , and had to pay an upcharge of $_00 , because the order didnt reach some magical $_00 threshold .
negative	really .
negative	what a load .
negative	i have been ordering dog_food from you guys for quite some time .
negative	i placed an order a couple weeks_ago which normally takes 0 - 0 days , it sat in a warehouse for 0 days and not until i called did anyone realize the problem .
negative	i cancelled the order and am seriously thinking about going back to my previous online provider .
negative	bought shocks for my van and after installing them they had no shock_absorber quality at all - totally_useless
negative	i filled_out the parts_geek support form within 0 hour , asking if i could order better ones and return the bad ones
negative	they say i can not return the bad ones with one hour on them , will never order from parts_geeks again
negative	hi yes thank_you , i got my order today !!
negative	dpd have been very bad tho !!
negative	the box is all ripped open and the oats bag also has_been ripped open !!
negative	also i ordered on the 00 / 00 / 00 for next_day delivery and didn_'_t receive anything till 00 / 00 / 00 !
negative	i '_m very unhappy with level of service i '_ve received from my - protein and dpd !
negative	and unless something is done !!
negative	i will not be using you again !
negative	if a wrong part is sent by your error or theirs they will not respond to email through their system and that is the only way to contact them .
negative	partsgeek has over 000 complaints with the bbb of new_jersey , 000 complaints in the last_year .
negative	sold me vouchers that were already used and wont do anything about it .
negative	i have followed their rules but wont do anything .
negative	very bad
negative	ordered a particular part you sent the wrong parts even_though i specified the part .
negative	will use you again .
negative	had to reorder from a more reputable_company !!!
negative	!
negative	ordered part - received part - part did not include all pieces - notified partsgeek -
negative	partsgeek gives me the runaround - i still do not have an answer - thank_you for asking - i will be glad to buy parts somewhere_else .
negative	still_waiting for my sunglasses which i ordered three_weeks_ago .
negative	keep being told the the same message over and over again .
negative	getting very frustrated and mad .
negative	i ordered glasses from framesdirect . com , and had difficulty placing the order .
negative	the customer service rep i worked with was difficult to work with .
negative	however , i thought it would be worth it once the glasses came .
negative	they arrived and were not what i was expecting .
negative	that didn_'_t upset me too much , as i knew i was taking some chances online .
negative	here '_s what has me upset : i tried to return the glasses and no one would take responsibility for getting me an_rma or whatever the return_authorization is .
negative	i '_ve tried by phone , contact form and direct email to accomplish this .
negative	never_heard back .
negative	as a result , i '_ve filed a complaint against framesdirect .
negative	all i wanted to do was to return the merchandise .
negative	the only good thing about this trip was the rental rate ( very cheap ).
negative	other than that , it was one fail after another .
negative	while trying to cancel a couple initial bookings ( the first because thrifty is erroneously listed as " logan airport " when they are several miles_away ; the second due to a rescheduling on my end ), i encountered an error_message that would not allow me to cancel my trip .
negative	why ?
negative	because i elected car_rental insurance_coverage , which was charged before my pickup date , and unable to be reversed .
negative	i had to call them 0 separate times to get this done .
negative	the 0st call went to a clueless girl , probably in calcutta , the 0nd was quick & effective & got my 0st booking refunded .
negative	the next_day was a different story .
negative	wait times were 00_mins , 0 hr & 00_minutes , and 0 hrs & 00_minutes on the 0 calls i made to their 000 #.
negative	i finally dug up their corporate number in tx & got someone on the phone ( ilona ).
negative	she was great & got everything done , but because of the crazy wait times ( customer service is king guys ), and the website '_s inability to allow me to revise / rescind my booking ( days before it began ), i will be going to another travel website going forward .
negative	travelocity will never see another dime of my business , and i look_forward to the day they announce their chapter 00 bankruptcy , which ( from the inept way they do_business ) is imminent .
negative	best regards , jeff gorman
negative	really disappointed , no parts , no customer service
negative	the money i saved is wasted . i have to goto my local_supplier to buy .
negative	i have a call and letter that i '_m sending to rge bbb
negative	thanks for wasting my time
negative	they acknowledged an error on the site where i bought their item , causing an overcharge .
negative	a few_days_later they would only promise half the amount that was due to the error after " reviewing " the case .
negative	how is this even legal ?
negative	it '_s like a scam .
negative	i like the visual mods but rapid_fire does not work .
negative	and it shuts_off randomly .
negative	poor quality
negative	bought a part for my 0000_jeep_grand_cherokee , a front_bumper moulding .
negative	received the part and it doesn_'_t come_close to fitting my front_bumper assembly .
negative	contacted this fly by night outfit twice and received some bs about getting back to me within 00 - 00_hours .
negative	ya right , all they did was tell me how good they are and how long they have been in business .
negative	never recommend them to anyone i know !
negative	received item , but not needed , and contacted to return and never response for this matter .
negative	i ordered a part and paid to expedite the part and it arrived damaged so i then had the privelege to pay to ship it back .
negative	i then ordered the part again and paid to have it expedited and again it arrived damaged ( same spring broken ) so now i get to pay to send it back again .
negative	i have tried to call , no luck , send various emails to get customer_services to assist and all i get is canned email reponses so i assume there is not any actual_human_beings working at this company .
negative	i have stupidly tried twice to do_business and would have to be totally ignorant to do it again since not a single time has anyone done anything to help resolve my problem and i have spent $_00 shipping on defective parts
negative	if you get your estimated time of arrival to pick_up the car wrong by more than one hour they will rent your car to someone_else .
negative	this happened to us and we ended_up paying double the original booking price to get a car .
negative	i do not know if the other rental_agencies at avigon tgv have the same one hour policy .
negative	i gave a one star_rating because the 0 hour policy is unreasonable and not advertised in any place i could find .
negative	i ordered a 0wd switch for a chevy_truck .
negative	instead , they sent me a mirror switch for a chrysler .
negative	no telephone contact is available on the website , so i filled_out a web form , asking to exchange the product for the correct part , and for them to call me .
negative	they refused to exchange the part , but did offer an_rma .
negative	they also refused to pay return shipping on the incorrect part they sent .
negative	i still don_'_t have the refund , 00 days_later .
negative	i also never received a phone_call or any telephone contact information from them .
negative	definitely would not use again , based on this experience .
negative	placed my order on a thursday_evening with every expectaton of having it processed and shipped within 00 hour fill or kill policy as i was told .
negative	weekend passes and no shipment therefore i began calling monday and unable to reach anyone by phone .
negative	i would hold the line only to have the system hangup on me - no personal customer service .
negative	finally spoke with jason and told he would check into it , call back next_day if status had not changed .
negative	next_day - no change in order processing however my money was withdrawn from my bank ( charge paid against card ).
negative	back to calling but no answer so i went online and filed customer service claim - soon got automated email reply that i would have answer in00 hours .
negative	this continued for several_times and i finally began a dialogue with cheryl ;.
negative	eventually after 0 more days the order was finally processed after 0 business days ( following thursday ).
negative	i was informed by cheryl that 0 other orders along with mine was held up by their warehouse .
negative	due to my being in the same state of shipment ( nc ) i received the order on friday at 0 :_00pm .
negative	my body shop could not complete the repairs on time because i could not get the parts in a reasonable time frame - i was extremely angry .
negative	note_: i was credited my 0 . 00 shipping -.
negative	although cost for these parts was a great deal - the aggravation in this order is the worst i have ever received with any online order for automotive_parts etc i have been involved with .
negative	i ordered a watch and my credit_card was charged soon after .
negative	a few_days went by without information about the shipping of the watch .
negative	i emailed them about the status of the order and they responded " should we go_ahead with the order " and i said yes meanwhile the price of the watch went down by almost $_00 . 00 at amazon .
negative	another e_-_mail to them about the status of the watch and matching amazon price ; no response .
negative	eleven days gone by and no news about the the watch .
negative	finally , i cancelled my order and money was returned without an_apology .
negative	so i found the part i was looking for and it said on the online website it fits in my car and i had no doutes that it was the wrong part so now i '_m stuck with the wrong part cause its past the 00 days which i never knew about and i tried_calling it in but all i would get is sorry for the in convinence but were experiencing a large call_volume every other day same result ..... all i want is the right radiator for my car maybe a parts exchange ....
negative	right now i have a radiator that '_s just sitting in my storage no use ... i would rate this 0_stars and refer you to friends but this **** sucks .....
negative	sat for 00_minutes on the phone weighting for somebody to answer the phone , no answer tried customer service same thing good thing it was a 000 number cant tell me they are that busy , wouldnt call that very good service .
negative	parts weren ’ t even close to what was described on page .
negative	i tried to purchase 0 struts for the rear_window of my 0000_jeep , and if i was actually able to install them , they would have broken the glass !
negative	i couldn_'_t move them by hand and had a hard time compressing them in a vise .
negative	all the things i purchased came from many different_warehouses , almost $_00 in total shipping , 0 items in 0 boxes over 0 days .
negative	i think i could have gotten a much_better deal locally or somewhere_else .
negative	i would have a tough time ordering from partsgeek again .
negative	i have dealt_with other on - line auto_parts companies , moss motors , victoria british and even jc_whitney and have never had to go through so much to return a part !
negative	web_site easy to use and the price is very competitive .
negative	will use this company in the future .
negative	we booked a two bed rooms suite in breckenridge and was told we can change it if our plans_changed .
negative	we called back whitin allowed time .
negative	we were told that they need calling hotel and make the change .
negative	since we called them on suterday , we were told that the hotel manager is not on duty and expedia is going to take_care of it and confirm the change on monday .
negative	we didn_'_t receive call from expedia on monday and call them back .. after going through the whole_process , receptionist hang_up the phone .. we called back , they hang_up again .
negative	my glasses took a month from ordering to delivery , had i ordered from my opticians they would have taken 0 days .
negative	i was not kept_informed as to why my glasses were late , and when i contacted selectspecs i was not offered any resolution other than i have to wait .
negative	other_companies would have at_least delivered them by a quicker method to make up for some of the lost time .
negative	i will not be using them again , just terrible .
negative	this is my comment about answer ( dec - 00 ) from officialiphoneunlock . co . uk
negative	there are 0 things .
negative	( a ) they understood that my original card has_been expired ( oct - 00 ).
negative	( b ) i gave them question about bank_transfer that they said that they made on ( nov - 00 )
negative	*_*_* [ question to officialiphoneunlock . co . uk on dec - 00 ] *_*_*
negative	0 . when has_been the transaction for bank_transfer has_been made ( date and time )?
negative	0 . what kind of transfer has_been done , for example , electrical wire_transfer etc ?
negative	0 . name of their supplier who sender money ( bank name etc_.)
negative	*_*_*_*_*_*_*_*_*_*_*_*_*_*_*_*_*_*_*_*_*_*_*_*_*_*_*_*_*_*_*_*_*_*_*_*_*_*_*_*_*_*
negative	i gave them these question on dec - 00 .
negative	because to trace bank_transfer , i need detail information .
negative	i am waiting they provide information to me .
negative	- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
negative	my iphone ( softbank , jp ) could not be unlocked for 0 month .
negative	and they did not refund me ( 000 . 00 gbp ).
negative	customer_support is not functioning .
negative	see below history .
negative	it is really fact oriented .
negative	still do you want them to unkock your phone ?
negative	feb - 00 - 0000
negative	ordered
negative	july - 0 - 0000
negative	canceled because it seems like they cannot unlock my phone
negative	oct - 00 - 0000
negative	i gave a call them .
negative	they informed my credit_card has_been expired .
negative	gave the other card information
negative	oct - 00 - 0000
negative	got information about refund process problem .
negative	they change to refund by bank_transfer and gave them bank_account info .
negative	nov - 00 - 0000
negative	i asked them about transfer situation because any money transferred my bank_account
negative	nov - 00 - 0000
negative	they informed " has already been made ".
negative	but still any money transferred in my bank_account
negative	nov - 00 , dec - 00 & dec - 00 - 0000
negative	i asked them to check transaction .
negative	but they completely ignore my request .
negative	according to above history , this company seem to be scam or doesn_'_t have a sense of customer service .
negative	they can proof that they are not scam , if they can send money to my bank_account .
negative	absolutely the worst experience ever !!!!!
negative	$ 0 , 000 . 00 for 0 roundtrip tickets to tampa , fla and back that were changed 0months into the booking and 0 months before the trip !!!
negative	this placed a cruise ship waiting and at return , no flights for 0 days .
negative	all 0 including workers and students who had to return that day .
negative	despite_being on stand by the whole day , 0 had to rent a car to get home !!!
negative	travel guard insurance worthless because bookit was at fault .
negative	their response ?
negative	we sent one e_-_mail in december to say some changes !
negative	no followup e_-_mail , no phone_call , nothing !
negative	so we did not receive an e_-_mail and so sorry !!!
negative	!
negative	your service is helpful when it works !
negative	when signing_up for the first time it asked me about an old secondary home phone line that i used to own 00 + years_ago ( no_clue what that number was even when i had it ).
negative	after calling in to confirm more information i was able to proceed .
negative	now every time i want to do something with the service that i have paid , in my opinion , a significant_amount of money to use , i have to call in !
negative	luckily the customer service agents that employ are helpful and relatively friendly .
negative	unfortunately i will have to call them again just to use the service that i am paying for .
negative	if i don_'_t decide to cancel by then .
negative	i think your shipping speed sucks !!!!!!!!!!!!!
negative	!
negative	and i have to leave my shop untended to sign for this item .
negative	never again will i buy from this company !!!!!!!!!!!!!!
negative	!
negative	my mother recieved your flowers on saturday 00st of august_0000 .
negative	she was very happy with the flowers but the card had several typos , for example instead of it being a maverlous mother , it was marbleus mother .
negative	instead of it being love from brian , cheryl , conor and lewis , it read brain , sharon , conner and luis .
negative	my mother didnt want me to make a big_deal about it and i didnt , but since you sent me a review option i thought i better be honest with you .
negative	the service wasnt great .
negative	thank_you .
negative	mr brian sinclair
negative	struts that did arrive were packed very poorly .
negative	one fell out of the box in transit or was never packed so i can '_t do the strut job on my car , and nobody is being accountable .
negative	looked for the part that i needed it said y ' all had it in stock ordered it and payed for it then the next_day it says y ' all didnt have the part , so i wasn_'_t really happy with that
negative	always used driveaway never had any_problems until last_week .
negative	at thifty desk at newcastle airport had problems straight_away - had pre_- paid for 0 days hire - on thifty computer it said i only paid for 0 days .
negative	waited for quite a while until the young_lady said they will sort it out later .
negative	she asked me for my credit_card and charged me an_additional $_000 . 00 - she said that was a holding fee and it would be cancelled when i return the car .
negative	on returning home i checked with my bank_account on line and they actually took this out already and to date this money has not been put back into my account not happy
negative	i ordered a tie_rod and when it arrived it was damaged and i never reveived my steering well gasset .
negative	i tried to contact geek parts customer service at the 000 000 - 0000 and there is no customer service .
negative	i have email geek part regarding the missing part and the defected tie_rod but no responce yet .
negative	i need some one that can help me with my order or
negative	return my money .
negative	why even have a contact phone_number if no one ever answer ?
negative	i had ordered the wrong part and it took me three_days to get_ahold of partsgeek through to a representative .
negative	recently , a friend told me about this site .
negative	he said that it '_s where his sister - in - law bought her nursing textbooks .
negative	i decided to give it a try and use it rather_than buying a more_expensive one from my school '_s bookstore .
negative	i found my book , selected the fastest shipping possible , and proceeded to checkout .
negative	they told me that they had the book available when i ordered it .
negative	it wasn_'_t until 00 days_later , when the textbook was scheduled to arrive , that i get an_email_saying that my order was not processed because the book was no_longer in stock .
negative	before i can buy the book from the school store , my professor drops me for " not having the proper materials for class ".
negative	this service is so unorginised , i wouldn_'_t even trust them to send a pizza to your house .
negative	never using them again and i suggest that you don_'_t either .
negative	i wouild not bother with jalbum they are greedy and once you upload your pictures you have to pay and pay .
negative	i went to google plus which is easier to manage and free .
negative	unfortunately some of my albums are in jalbum and i cannot get to them with our keep ing up a subscription .
negative	i would tell a friend that this place has the freaking worst ordering system and worst customer service of any business i have ever_dealt_with .
negative	upon_arriving at my hilton_garden inn i was told that i would not get my hhonors points because i booked through expedia which i would never have done .
negative	i hate expedia '_s service and would never have used them .
negative	i booked my room on the internet but not through expedia .
negative	this is the second time i have been told the points did not count because of booking online and yet i had called the hotel_directly .
negative	this happened also with a marriott .
negative	i do not want anything to do with expedia and am concerned that these reservations go through expedia without notice to the consumer
negative	got one tracking_number , received on part that was wrong and the other part never showed_up .
negative	sent 0 " tickets " with no response and no number to call .
negative	buyer_beware do not order from this company
negative	i ordered a product through this website over a month_ago .
negative	upon_contacting them via_email , they do not respond or offer to suggest a resolution .
negative	i paid for an item and have yet to see if it materializes .
negative	i would never , ever use this site again .
negative	i ' d rather go through another side and pay 00x as much .
negative	cimber did not fly us home .
negative	we did not get any information from bravofly .
negative	we had to pay for another flight .
negative	we will never use bravofly again
negative	i tried 0 times to make a reservation .
negative	i ended hanging up because i couldn_'_t understand her .
negative	i could hear her fine and it was a good connection .
negative	her filipino accent was too strong .
negative	i won_'_t use that hotel again
negative	turned part to ups and asked them to take it to post_office . ordered part 0 / 00 and part is still not here 0 / 00 .
negative	what did i pay shipping for ups or post_office ?
negative	want my money back .
negative	i was never informed of the fine_print or clause in your reservation booking by the 0 email , and i was transferred around by them constantly and told i needed to speak with hotels . com and then back to expedia .
negative	this company sucks plain and simple you will be lucky to actually talk to a live_person if you need to the 0 email they send you does not explain your reservation or cancellation_policy in full detail and the company tries to scam you and lock you into your stay and gives you attitude if you need to make a change or cancel 0 day early your stay and they charge your cc anyway , stay_away !!!!!!
negative	!
negative	ordered 0 parts and they all came from different_warehouses so 0 separate shipping_charges .
negative	one part is totally wrong and the fine_print says even if part shipped is in partsgeek error customer has to pay for shipping both_ways .
negative	the skins took_forever to apply , especially the front frame .
negative	bubbles are still there and i am thinking of throwing it away - i almost did in frustration when applying them , the cost stopped me !
negative	it should come with a screen cover , however as it didn_'_t i bought one which i applied 0st , and i might_add was easier to apply .
negative	when trying to adjust the positioning of the frame skin it kept pulling off the screen skin !
negative	even if the skins had been fitted_perfectly i have to say that it s looks cheap and not worth the price .
negative	the only good idea is having the matching wallpaper but even that image was grainy & had writing on it that was not apparent from the preview on the website !
negative	i give it one star as i suppose it will stop getting my ipad from being scratched !
negative	i had problems talking and understanding the person_who was trying to deal with my reservation and getting my credit_card thru .
negative	i finally told_him , after being on hold twice for a total of about 00 mi ., to cancel the entire reservation .
negative	then the next_day amer .
negative	express altered me about a charge to my account for the reservation .
negative	i called them and told them to reject the charge .
negative	i had contacted the motel on my own and made my reservation .
negative	very upset with the whole_experience and will never use again .,
negative	my spouse and i were scheduled to depart for las_vegas on august 0nd , unfortunately our daughter ended_up in the emergency department on july 00st with acute appendicitis .
negative	she was subsequently scheduled for surgery on august 0st at 0000 .
negative	i called southwest airlines to cancel our flight and without_any_issues at all we were given dollar for dollar credit for another flight as long as it occurs within the next year .
negative	bookit on the other hand would not allow me to cancel online due to the 00 hour_window even_though we were more than 00_hours from our originally scheduled check in time .
negative	i called the service number listed on the web for which i was on hold for over 00_minutes before i was able to speak to anyone .
negative	i was immediately told that i would receive a refund for only 0 day of the hotel booking due to the late notice regardless of the situation surrounding the cancellation .
negative	the refund due to us was to be $_000 of the $_000_dollars we had spent to stay at vdara .
negative	the gentlemen on the phone was very cold and lacked any sympathy for our situational cancellation .
negative	i asked if there was anything further he could do or if i could speak to a supervisor , i was promptly told that this was bookit '_s policy and that no further consideration would be given to the matter .
negative	i was told that we would receive the $_000 within 00 business days .
negative	00 business days_later and still no refund .
negative	my advice is to steer_clear of this online travel company and use someone with proven reliability .
negative	trying to save a few dollars on our trip ultimately cost us hundreds .
negative	we will never use this company again .
negative	the only reason i give this site 0_star is because i am not allowed to assign zero_stars .
negative	gave up on getting my money back . cant call partsgeek for live_person . you have to go through days of emails to find out you have too pay for shipping . i dont trust parts_geek and ill just cut my losse . leeson learned , do not use online services without live_person . always call and find out theare systum .
negative	i bought a liscense plate_holder for my gmc , which that small part was 0 dollars to ship , and not only that it didn_'_t even come with any hardware to install it .
negative	not only that a part of it was broken and it didn_'_t even come with an invoice in the box .
negative	i '_m very dis - satisfied !
negative	!
negative	i have ordered from comms_express quite a few_times and have always been happy with the product and delivery turnaround time .
negative	you should tell people that you are a booking agent .
negative	no one told me and i was charged more than what i would have paid if i would have not called .
negative	i thought i was calling the hotel .
negative	if have better alternative its could be the beast
negative	headlights where damaged during packing .
negative	wow , 00_%_off prices , so i ordered an 00 ' x 00 ' blue solar pool_cover .
negative	when the box arrived , the label said 00 ' x 00 ' blue cover but they sent me a 00 ' round white solar_cover .
negative	not even close .
negative	i called up doheny '_s and customer service filled_out a form and the supervisor would get back .
negative	alomost a week_later , no reply .
negative	so i caled them again , the rep issued me a pick_up form .
negative	i asked if i was going to get the original item i ordered , and she had no_clue .
negative	good thing i charged it to my amex .
negative	i notified them instantly about the problem .
negative	i do not trust the company .
negative	they send you whatever the person in the warehouse wants to send .
negative	i initially called them to get info .
negative	on there dead pixel policy .
negative	very disappointed with the customer service in just answering some questions for me .
negative	the rep . was not friendly or knowledgeable .
negative	if you don_'_t like your job then quit and make yourself miserable !
negative	" how about a hello how are you today , what can help you with !"
negative	that alone would get me to come_back to do_business with them .
negative	like i said , very rude and vague in response to my questions .
negative	if it wasn_'_t for the fact that she confirmed that there screens are guaranteed to not have any dead_pixels , i would not have bought from them .
negative	as far as the screen was concerned it was excellent !
negative	i placed an order for new prescription_glasses on may 0rd , i receive a notice that my frames are ' backordered ' on may 0th .
negative	after not hearing any status in a while i inquire_about my order on may 00nd , they respond on may_00th that my frames have been ' discontinued '.
negative	they offer me to reselect for a different frame suggesting their " fast shipping ' section which are items in - stock readily_available .
negative	i select a new frame on may_00th that is listed as " fast shipping , same day dispatch ", i just received a notice today ( may_00th ) stating that my new selection is ' backordered '!!!!
negative	this company is a joke , i '_ve been waiting almost 0_weeks and no glasses yet .
negative	i requested an update with exact date i should expect my new glasses , if they do not respond accordingly i will be asking for a refund .
negative	the reservation and documentation did produce a clear understanding of the reservation and the extra_charges that awaited the return of the vehicle .
negative	prepaid usually means the total price and not the total price , but by the way we did not charge you yet for the drop charge of $_000 .
negative	if all had been known - i would have looked harder rather_than being led into the extra_charge at the end .
negative	never place an order with this company .
negative	not only did they screw up the quantities for the parts ordered , they took the money - didn_'_t ship the parts and were totally non_- responsive with answers or service when questioned multiple_times about why they screwed_up
negative	placed my order on a friday , the next_day took my money out of my account .
negative	waited another week with no word , initiated customer inquiry .
negative	company claimed that my parts we temporarily_out of stock , and would take 0 to 0 days to credit my account back .
negative	i wasted 0_weeks with my car broke_down , waiting to hear something .
negative	not a good experience at all .
negative	i had to pay an extra 000_euros because we were 0 minutes late at the check in barcelona .
negative	the woman in the check in was very unpleasant in her behaviour .
negative	i dont think i will fly with bravofly again .
negative	i have returned my product now i have to wait thirty days for a refund .... never again
negative	got to the resort and even_though i had a paid reservation ..... no record at the resort .... never again ... it took 0 hours to sort out .
negative	although very pleased with the jacket i eventually received and have already bought 0 items previously which i received without_any_problems on this occasion i tried to order was told immediately the order was unsuccessful and then i e_mailed them to confirm what was happening which i never received a reply from then reordered again then received 0 jackets and 0 sent to wrong_address sent jacket back received refund which cost me £_00 on bank charges as funds weren_'_t enough to cover jacket price
negative	items no on stock !
negative	never answer the phone !
negative	no customer service at all
negative	i tried to order my parts and could not verify if i got the right part .
negative	could not get_ahold of anybody .
negative	wonder_why ?
negative	not good customer_support .
negative	then i discovered that i did not get the air shock that i wanted so now it '_s a song and dance to get the parts back and i have to pay for shipping ?
negative	this is not right .
negative	never had to do that with any other orders i have done before .

negative	efter 00min forfilm kommer en tekniker ind_og siger , at det_ikke_er muligt at få filmen igen .
negative	vi trasker ned i informationen og beder om refundering af alt det vi_havde købt .
negative	vi får en refundering - men værdien matcher ikke engang for halvdelen af det , vi_har_købt for .

negative	skandale biograf !
negative	i put the fuel_pump in and after all the work it didn_'_t work
negative	never book with easytobook . com .
negative	they will take your money and will not return it . even if you cancel within 00_minutes .
negative	do not use them
negative	my order was lost by ups , and i got no help and nothing but a run around from partsgeek .
negative	ups is a sad excuse for a shipping company , and partsgeek '_s customer service needs to not only step it up , but partsgeek needs to go with fedex_ground with automatic $_000 shipping insurance .
negative	very disappointed .
negative	i ordered three pairs of trainers only one arrived i have to email a few_times to get the order sorted .
negative	i ordered three mugs .
negative	when they packed them they just put the three mugs in a box wrapping them together .
negative	all i received was three broken mugs .
negative	they should have packed them better .
negative	ordered some shorts , arrived quickly but unfortunately did not fit so i returned them .
negative	this was four weeks_ago .
negative	no refund .
negative	no reply to e_-_mails , does not answer phone .
negative	unacceptable service
negative	i ordered 0 items .
negative	two water pumps and some motor_mounts .
negative	i work at a car dealership in the parts department for over 00 years and know what i '_m looking for when it comes to ordering the correct parts .
negative	i ordered on a tuesday and expecting to get the items in by the weekend so i could install them .
negative	the order didn_'_t show up until the following_tuesday . i had it deliver to my work address to make it faster . lol i '_m in cincinnati , ohio and it shipped from new_jersey .
negative	after checking the order and finding out the water_pump for my 0000 plymouth rooadrunner 000 was wrong i emailed them to find out what was the process to return the wrong pump .
negative	they emailed me back with a return number to ship both pumps back and did not explain if the catalog was wrong or the part i picked out was wrong .
negative	now i have to pay shipping to send it back and maybe a restocking_charge !
negative	i wish i could just talk to someone and get an answer !
negative	i sent my phone in to have a cracked lcd repaired .
negative	they replaced the cracked lcd with another screen that did not fit and was literally separating from the phone when i got it back - you could see light coming from all of the edges and it popped off the phone completely if you applied pressure not to mention that the gaps allowed dust in which clouded the edges of the screen as well as the camera !!
negative	i sent it back to them but had to negotiate free shipping which they tried to have me pay even_though their site warranties their products and services for 00 days .
negative	when i got the phone back a second time it was the exact_same situation with the product .
negative	they told me their techs cleared it and that is the way the product was supposed to be .
negative	to this day they have not responded whether they are going to " fix " it a third time .
negative	no you took a week and a half to get my part
negative	read the fine_print about each item had to return two different tail_lights and still don_'_t have the correct one
negative	place an order at the beginning of nov , not updates at all .
negative	send inquiry online twice , no reply at all .
negative	finally receive email two_weeks_later .
negative	saying that my order was cancelled , no reason at all .
negative	i re - place the order to see how it goes , one week passed , nothing happen , just like last order .
negative	today i receve a email to ask my opinion , ok , this is my opinion : " this is the worst experience in my 0 years online shopping "
negative	holiday didn_'_t start well when i was made to wait for 00_mins in at cold at 0am because the driver went to the wrong terminal despite_being informed twice .
negative	with no apology and a ' it '_s not my fault i '_ve only just started my shift ' i went on my way concerned_about the safety of my car .
negative	on return the instructions as to where to meet were awful .
negative	my car had a number of scuffs , which apparently not possibly their fault as the ' park them side by side '.
negative	generally very dissatisfied .
negative	this is the first time ever that a website , store , etc .
negative	tells the customer that no matter who makes the mistake , the customer or the geek , the customer pays the return shipping !
negative	who '_s the geek ... not you guys .
negative	the customer who fails to read the fine_print is .
negative	and although you give a telephone_number ... surprise it doesn_'_t work !
negative	e_-_mail us and we '_ll get back to you in 00_hours .
negative	there are too many car parts dealers that will benefit from your " screw you " attitude !
negative	do not order from partgeek if you get the wrong order it is bad bad bad to get the right thing as part # on boxs do not mean that you get right part in that box and that you have to email them as there is no phone # to call them .
negative	blackcircles supply tyres that are up to 0 years old and claim that their trade association approve of this .
negative	the british tyre manufacturers association recommend that tyres are changed between 0 and 0 years after manufacture .
negative	blackcircles will do nothing if you complain after the tyres are fitted .
negative	if you use this company check the date stamp on the tyres before they are fitted and if you make enough of a fuss they will offer to take them back .
negative	site failed when i tried to book my trip .
negative	i had to call customer service .
negative	i was charged more because the flight wasn_'_t available .
negative	the next time the same thing happened .
negative	i refused to pay more .
negative	lady on phone was rude when i asked why this keeps happening .
negative	southwest vacations had no issue .
negative	book it needs to purchase more bulk flights then it does .
negative	it shouldn_'_t sell out flights when a customer chooses trip options for a few_minutes .
negative	the sight crashed twice .
negative	customer service told me it was due to the unavailable flights both_times .
negative	order for next_day using a business delivery address as you need the parts urgently and the delivery time they give you is between 00 - 00 and 00 . 00_hrs hardly office hours and i went elswhere to get another set of the goods
negative	appliance master not only improperly diagnosed my problem but when i pointed_out their error the refused to refund their fee .
negative	see their response below .
negative	notice they very carefully state that they did give me a diagnosis and therefore where entitled to keep my payment .
negative	what they do not say is they were completely incorrect .
negative	bottom_line is i did some research online , properly diagnosed the problem , ordered the replacement part and fixed the washing_machine myself in less_than one hour .
negative	it was actually quite gratifying .
negative	" however , the part that the technician diagnosed at the time of your appointment is # 0 in the parts diagram .
negative	that part , in both colors is discontinued .
negative	the technician would need that control_panel in order to complete the repair .
negative	the part that you supplied is the user_interface .
negative	after_reviewing your charges the only_thing you have paid is $_00 . 00 which is our service fee for a diagnosis on a general electric appliance .
negative	since we supplied you with a diagnosis we will not be refunding our service fee .
negative	thank_you and have a great day ,

negative	we recently_purchased a new tv for my 00 year_old father , unfortunately after few_days it developed a fault with the infa red so basically would not respond to the remote .
negative	ok , no problem we thought , dissapointing but as it was so new we fully expected to be able to return to the shop for an exchange .
negative	not so simple !
negative	my father took the tv back to comet but they would not accept his word and sent him home again with the faulty tv and gave him a phone_number to make an_appointment with an engineer .
negative	on phoning to make an_appointment the staff at the call_centre when he finally got through to a real_person advised him he needed to take the remote back to the shop as thay had equipment in store to test it .
negative	back he went again to comet again with the remote to be told what we already new .
negative	the remote is fine and the tv at fault .
negative	he then has to phone the helpline again to book an_appointment for an engineer to come out .
negative	a week_later the engineer turns up and signs a piece of paper to say the tv is faulty and can either be returned for exchange or sent away for repair .
negative	my father chooses to exchange so finally we have a result you think .
negative	wrong !
negative	on arrival at store we are told the tv was end of line and no_longer available .
negative	ok , refund then please ?
negative	no sorry we don_'_t do refunds unless items are returned in original packaging unused !
negative	at this point we are running out of patience .
negative	eventually we find a similar tv that we are happy with but it '_s £_00 more_expensive .
negative	we asked politely for this amount to be waivered due to phone_calls , petrol , inconvenience etc .
negative	sorry , we can '_t do that we don_'_t make any proffit on tv '_s ...( why have a shop full of them then ) then just as we are paying the extra £_00 after a long debate they try to sell us an extended_warranty at an inflated price and offer us a circuit breaker with a pretend discount !!
negative	these peolpe are really unbeleavable , they offer goods at competive prices but then prey on customers at the checkout with hard sell on addition items and insurance .
negative	the customer service and attitude of the staff is as bad as i '_ve ever_experienced and they even have the cheek to put a notice on the counter advising that they will not tollerate abuse or unreasonable customers which to me speaks_volumes as thay are obviousley used to dealing_with lots of unhappy customers !
negative	we were looking for a 0 fold shower screen , aica bathrooms had one at reasonable price fitting the bill .
negative	we ordered it , it arrived on time , well_packaged , looking nice .
negative	we employed a plumber to fit the screen , so this was done professionally ... however this is where the problems arose .
negative	the screen leaked in almost every bend by the cogs of the bend , the join at the wall .
negative	the plumber returned , stating he had sealed both inside and out of the fitting so the leaks were not from the wall fitting .
negative	he sealed the wall and used the silicone ' goo ' proved for every cog hoping this would prevent the leaks ... it did not .
negative	he returned again , putting clear silicone in each cog and by the wall fitting cog in an effort ot make it like rubber seals , as the seal on the screen did not cover the cogs .. it still leaks .
negative	basically the whole unit is unfit for purpose without drowning every fold , bend , cog in silicone , which makes buying a solid one just as simple .
negative	very , very , very poor design and poor quality goods .
negative	i could not recommend them ( the plumber states he knows other_companies but this results in spending more money than originally_planned , which is unhelpful )
negative	it '_s awful !
negative	i don_'_t recommend .
negative	bought a new rear muffler for a bmw .
negative	their price was ~$ 000 , though list price is over $_000 .
negative	the muffler is large , about 0ft long , welded metal , weighing about 00lbs .
negative	shipping was fast , but it arrived in zero packaging .
negative	the literally stuck a ups label directly to the bare metal of the muffler and shipped it like that .
negative	no box , no packaging , no protection at all .
negative	of course , it arrived damaged , with the left rear muffler tip totally crushed .
negative	customer service is non_- existent and on their terms only -- no phone or online_chat , and you must email through their ticket system .
negative	each time you get a reply , the person on the other end does not leave a name , title , or contact info and signs off anonymously .
negative	their emails are virtually all one - sentence long , and provide no customer care or attention .
negative	not even a greeting .
negative	they state on their site that customers are responsible for return shipping , no matter who '_s at fault .
negative	i complained and they sent me a ups label .
negative	no_idea if they are going to deduct the cost of this label from my refund amount .
negative	and who_knows when the refund will come through .
negative	as of this writing , i still have no_idea if they are going to send me a replacement or not either .
negative	wish i had done a search of this company online before i ordered through them .
negative	they have over 000 complaints on the better business_bureau '_s website and dozens of negative yelp reviews .
negative	stay_away !
negative	my first and only experiance with parts_geek was not good at all !!
negative	i ordered an e00 bmw 000ci secondary elec cooling_fan assy and it was not the correct part .
negative	my customer could not wait for me to return and reorder the part so i had to remove the motor and relay and install it in the old shroud !!
negative	luckily i was able to make it work and my customer got their car in time .
negative	i can not afford to lose buisness due to wrong parts being delivered .
negative	bought a recycled bklack ink for my lexmark - ran_out of ink within 00 pages !!

negative	i ordered a fog_lamp for a 0000_jeep_grand_cherokee from on - line catalog .
negative	it had a
negative	picture right on it showing the rectangular lamp i needed .
negative	a small round fog_lamp
negative	was sent to me instead .
negative	i requested an_rma to return it , and got such .
negative	i have sent
negative	several e_-_mails_asking if i can get the one i ordered after returning the wrong one .
negative	each time i get the standard reply saying i will be contacted within a day or two .
negative	i got a reply , but not a satisfactory one one time .
negative	i then replied and was told to phone a number and given an extension .
negative	i tried several_times but the phone merry - go - round answering system kept cutting me off .
negative	i asked the parts dept to call me instead , telling them the phone contact i was given didn_'_t work .
negative	i am still trying to get through to a human_being to see if the part i need , and shown in the catalog , can be obtained .
negative	it has_been a week since i received the wrong part and still no
negative	resolution to the matter .
negative	if i can '_t get the rectangular lamp i ordered ( pictured in
negative	the catalog ) then i want a refund .
negative	can you help me resolve this issue ?

negative	booked online and paid , no_problems and very easy to use .
negative	was given a date and " am " arrival .
negative	wasted entire morning for someone to turn up , no - one did .
negative	called them and recieved no apology .
negative	they said they would chase him up but i cancelled .
negative	the lady was pleasent enough but again offered no apology .
negative	complete_waste of a morning .
negative	i would read all the reviews on parts_geek before ordering from them .
negative	i found that once they get your money , they will not respond to you in any manner .
negative	i received a part that does not work , and i can '_t get anyone to answer the phone , answer emails , or respond to the fax i have sent .
negative	i would suggest that you purchase some where else possibly locally , so that you can talk to customer service if you have any problem .
negative	it was packaged incorrectly .
negative	it didn_'_t matched the photo online .
negative	booked flight with bravofly .
negative	they sought and received an authorisation on my visa_debit_card which was approved .
negative	almost_immediately sent me an_email_saying my purchase was cancelled " because a problem occurred_during security controls in our system ".
negative	one week_later , my bank_account is still down the authorisation amount and the bank tells_me this may last another week .
negative	to say this authorisation is not a charge is disingenuous as i do not have the money available to me .
negative	if it took bravofly just a minute to determine they could not fill my booking ' for security_reasons ' why not do this check first before they process an authorisation request .
negative	believe me , i do not have the confidence to ever use these_people again - and cannot send an enquiry email as the only contact method is a charged phone line .
negative	definitely not a reliable or honorable booking agent ...
negative	update_:
negative	i just ( 0_weeks_later ) received a standard response from bravofly stating ( inter alia ):
negative	>> a credit_card limit block means that no charge is made to your credit_card and gives rise to no interest or clearing days .
negative	the amount the customer should pay on booking is simply ' frozen ' and not withdrawn from the customer '_s available funds .
negative	should the booking not be confirmed , no charges will be made by either bravofly or the airline .
negative	we remind you that he amount ' frozen ' will be released immediately .
negative	however , the time actually necessary to return the available credit depends on the specific rules of each bank .
negative	as such , the funds may not actually be available immediately .<<<
negative	i have responded as follows and am furious ...
negative	well , while the information here may be strictly speaking correct , you have very cleverly avoided the effects .
negative	your authorisation had the effect of reducing my available balance on my visa_debit_card by $_000 .
negative	that reduction is * still * in place after 00 days as my bank advised the hold is in place for that long before auto - reversing .
negative	you failed to even make an attempt to process my booking despite seeking the authorisation .
negative	you could have charged cents or even $ 0 against the authorisation to close and release it .
negative	your standard response which suggests you have caused no_harm or problems either indicates a stunning ignorance of the facts pertaining to your industry or a callous and calculated attempt to abdicate any responsibility .
negative	if you believe that i would ever consider again using an organisation so blind to the needs of its customers , then you are as misguided concerning customer loyalty as you are concerning customer service .
negative	i trust in this context you will consider the loyalty maxim that good service is referred to 0 people , but bad service is reported to twenty .
negative	why not do your internal security check first and only if successful , proceed to seeking an authorisation on the customer '_s card .
negative	and please please do not tell me it '_s your system that dictates the order .
negative	if it is , then change your system !
negative	don_'_t do_business with this company .
negative	if you do there will be no one to answer your emails .
negative	there is no one to answer the phone .
negative	if you paid a core_charge expecting to be reimbursed kiss it good buy because they will not give you the address to return the core too .
negative	i have had the box packed sitting here over a month with no address to return it to .
negative	despite 0 support_ticket and at_least 0 phone_calls they do not answer .
negative	don_'_t take my word for it ask the thousands of others who have been ripped of in similar ways buy this internet based ordering system .
negative	the computer forwards your order to a parts distributer but there is no one minding the office .
negative	there is no store .
negative	if you try to call to place an order you here music for about 0 / 0 a hour then they tell you their too_busy .
negative	if you select other you are immediately told their too_busy and told to use the support_ticket system on their website but they will not answer that either .
negative	i am filing a complaint with the credit_card hoping that they will credit be back what i was ripped_off by these thieves .
negative	again don_'_t take my word for it .
negative	to late i check ripoff . com and several other reporting sites .
negative	there are literally thousands of complaints against this company for the same type of issues .
negative	they have no consentience .
negative	beware you have been warned .
negative	i ordered a bandi mount for my fj cruiser and the item arrived damaged .
negative	the paint was scratched in several places and one of the corners was bent as if it had been dropped on the concrete .
negative	this item was damaged prior to shipment and should have never been shipped .
negative	this company should have quality checked the product prior to shipment .
negative	just_plain bad business .
negative	the company did respond with sarcasm and unprofessional behaviors .
negative	to anyone_who_cares .
negative	i live in canada and it is probably fault for not checking custom regulations .
negative	i ordered a multi_tool from the us .
negative	i never received it .
negative	i think it was confiscated at the border .
negative	i am out $_000 us because this company said ( swissarmy outpost ) said once it leaves there store .
negative	its out of there hands .
negative	they could have done some kind of partial_refund .
negative	but hey thats life .
negative	if you outside the us .
negative	make_sure you dont order knives or multi tools without checking our country '_s laws first .
negative	im done
negative	i ordered a fender from you and nnever got it and then when i try and call there isnt a number
negative	ordered protein and vitamins .
negative	got delivery 0 boxes of goat milk :) that i not ordered .
negative	one week trying reach them by mail , phone .
negative	not sorted yet .
negative	waisting of time and money .
negative	i started by talking with someone and placing a order for frames with presciption lenses .
negative	they assured me they had the frames and the order went pretty smooth right ??
negative	wrong !!!!
negative	less_than 00_hrs later i get a shaky e_-_mail saying they only had one of these frames left and it was cracked and is now discontinued . so they ask me to choose another frame without offering a refund .
negative	when i ask about a refund they say " sure well refund the frames and send you the lenses " i ask what am i supposed to do with lenses and no frames ?
negative	they say " the lenses are already made and cant be refunded ".
negative	i tell them its their fauly for making the lenses without having a frame for them and i should get a full_refund .
negative	the girl i was talking to started_acting like it was my fault that i ordered the prescription_lenses for my frames ... raising her voice and getting sarcastic it turned into a yelling match . when i asked to speak with someone_else i was told she was the messiah .
negative	ok so i suck all of that up pick a new frame and guess what ??
negative	00_hrs later i get a one line e_-_mail saying " we dont have that frame ".
negative	i dont understand_why they have all these frames on their site if they dont have them . this seems to be what they call a bait and switch . since upon reading_reviews this exact scenario has happened to other people ..( read their reviews ) ok so now its like 00 days_later and i ordered a 0rd frame and 00_hrs later ater being told they had it in my size .. i get another one line e_-_mail saying " we dont have that size .. your size has_been discontinued " why do they keep letting_me place these orders then ??
negative	overall i will never spend this kind of money online for somthing like this in my life time .. this place is the worst .
negative	ok so to update i was told that they had the 0rd frame in a size that would fit ( compared to my current frames which i gave them the size of ).. i accept that since i cant get a full_refund i figure i might as well order .
negative	so during the following 0_weeks i am asking , chating , calling to see where my order is .
negative	( i only push the button for sales since they dont answer the customer service extension and guess what ??
negative	they pick right up ) most of the time getting some rude nasty girl .. all of them are nasty people if you ask me .. becky , danielle , ariel etc . so finally i get these glasses and surprise the frames dont fit over my ears !!!
negative	you know whats really crazy ???
negative	its the wrong damn prescription !!!
negative	$_000 . 00 and they put the wrong prescription in ... they put lenses with + 0 . 00 and + 0 . 00 instead of - 0 . 00 and - 0 . 00 .
negative	you gotta be kidding me right ?
negative	so i call right_away tell them the presciption is wrong they tell me i still cant get a refund !!!
negative	and that the frames are too short and they want to charge a restocking_fee to exchange them ... or they say i can pay full price for new ones .. they say i have to allow them to fix them ...
negative	i say i dont have to do anything i send the glasses back i call them and they tell me theyll be in touch .. and they hang_up on me twice .. i havent called since but i did call my creditcard companys and disputed the charges .. one card gave_me my money back ( i split the cost between two cards ) and another dispute is still pending ... as i type this 0 / 00 / 00 .
negative	please pleaseplease do not be_fooled by these_people like i was .. whats really really funny is they sent me a generic e_-_mail askin me to leave them two good reviews so i could recieve a $_00 credit ... these_people try to pay for good reviews !!!!
negative	they are really crazy .. stay_tuned for updates
negative	had some questions after a successful booking .
negative	when calling into the support center , had tremendous difficulty_understanding the customer service person .
negative	after several_attempts of understand him , i asked to speak to a different person that i could understand and eventually a supervisor .
negative	he refused to let_me speak to a supervisor regardless of my repeated_requests .
negative	no resolution .
negative	even_though , the price seemed to be fair and the process to purchase was easy , i will not use them in the future just in case i need to ask questions on a booking .
negative	i simply could not understand how a customer_support person can refuse to accommodate a request to speak to a supervisor .
negative	poor service
negative	i booked a room for ny and realized the same day i picked the wrong month so i checked to see if i can change it to the right one and they told me ' we cannot change or cancel your reservation once it has already been booked '.
negative	i was furious !
negative	let '_s just say i won_'_t be using this site again .
negative	won_'_t use book bytes ever again .
negative	the service is impersonal and minimally responsive .
negative	it is abundantly clear to me that customer service is not a priority .
negative	there are other parts suppliers that i '_m sure would appreciate my business also provide better customer service and timely mail service .
negative	bad ac bad tires .
negative	customer service lady did nothing to fix it .
negative	she just told me that '_s only car she has it .
negative	take it or leave it .
negative	i booked rent a car 0 months before trip and i was very mad .
negative	after i was mad and hot !!
negative	! also while i was driving i had feeling that i will loose rear_wheels .
negative	tires ware gone and making a lot of noise .
negative	not good not good at all .
negative	i understand that ac can get bad but they should give me different car .
negative	the way they did could never fly in usa .
negative	but croatia is not usa .
negative	they need to work on that how to fix problems not just say sorry that '_s it , take it or leave it .
negative	i went on the partsgeek website and ordered a passenger_side_mirror for my daughter '_s honda_crv , they sent me the driver_side , so now they want me to pay to send back the wrong one and re - order , who is to say they won_'_t send me the wrong one again , they have no contact phone_number ..... fishy .
negative	i will never order fromthem again and i suggest you don_'_t purchase from them either .
negative	fedex use private drivers , who couldn_'_t care less whether you receive your parcels or not .
negative	even when i sit by the front window from 0 am to 0 pm (!!!)
negative	they tell me that i was the one who failed to receive the item by not answering the door , simply because the driver could not be bothered to stop by .
negative	they didn_'_t even leave me a card to prove that they had been , they simply told me i was lying .
negative	fedex also have some of the least helpful and least friendly customer service teams this side of royal_mail .
negative	not only will i avoid using fedex in the future , i will also avoid any company who_uses fedex .
negative	i would rather pay twice as much for an item to be delivered on time and in a professional_manner than risk using these_cowboys ever again .
negative	after some time , i have been able to arrange a re - delivery for my parcel .
negative	i will be waiting and watching very very carefully .
negative	0 / 00 for efficiency
negative	0 / 00 for customer_services
negative	avoid fedex at all cost
negative	the part that i ordered said it was brand_new , never used .
negative	once the part was installed on the vehicle it worked once and then would not work anymore .
negative	after taking it to an automotive_parts store and it being tested i was told it was not new but a cheap rebuild that a new sticker had been put on .
negative	i have contacted parts_geek about the issue with no response .
negative	if this is how they do_business then i will not do_business with them ever again .
negative	i have posted this on face book so that non of my automotive friends get sucked into their bad products , filed a better business_bureau report ( which they are not registered with ), and spread the word around as many of my military friends as possible .
negative	this is no way for a company to do_business !
negative	!
negative	i ordered a tyre and booked an_appointment for mobile_fitting .
negative	0 day later i had a call from them telling_me they didn_'_t have the tyre and wouldn_'_t be able to fit it , but i can wait extra days for them to source it then have it fitted .
negative	this wasn_'_t acceptable for me as i didn_'_t have a spare and needed the car , i asked for a refund and have had to wait 0 days for the refund , why should they keep my money for 0 days and i had to pay out for another tyre .
negative	would never use them again and would advise everyone to do the same
negative	i avoid paypal at all costs .
negative	they locked my account and at first couldn_'_t even give me the reason for it .
negative	when they finally agreed on a reason , they couldn_'_t give me the details and just kept my money for 0 months .
negative	i '_ll never use them again and would suggest no one keep any money with paypal since they can lock it at any time .
negative	i waited in line for 00_minutes to get to the desk to begin signing out a rental_car .
negative	the guy behind the counter tried to bully me into buying their insurance , which i told_him i did not need , b /_c i have full coverage through my personal auto policy and the credit_card i used to rent the car , but he went on to insist that i did , there must have been a commission in it for him .
negative	after that he went on to try selling me a tank of fuel , i told_him i would bring it back full , he said their price was cheaper_than all the stations around , i insisted that i did not want to buy fuel from him , that i would return it with a full_tank ... to which he replied , well you '_ll have to fill it within 0 miles of returning it and make_sure you have a receipt to prove it b /_c we '_ll need to see it .
negative	after this lengthy bs experience i went out to my " full size " 0 cylinder hyundai .
negative	the car had scuffs and scratches which i noted on their report card .
negative	the interior was littered with stains , was dirty , and it smelled horrible .
negative	when i got to my destination , i used sanitary wipes to clean the steering_wheel and shift knob , they were sticky .
negative	you may have a better experience in a different location , this was tampa , fl .
negative	as for me i will never use payless car_rental again .
negative	i will pay more to use any of the many other rental facilities .
negative	the listed 0 0 / 0 crowne plaza in lenexa , ks turned_out to be overated at 0 !
negative	nice guy at desk but even_though it was 00_% vacant he could not find us a decent room .
negative	after 0 tries we finally moved_into a nice room but it was not what we had purchased and ... three false fire alarms beginning at 0 : 00 a . m . yet no communication from desk that any of those were false alarms .
negative	no apology or any such offer .
negative	food in cafe ' was good and waitress was very helpful .

negative	consider them liars
negative	i don_'_t know whether its you or frontier , but the on - lin check - in re : the carry on luggage charge is totally awful - a disaster !!!!
negative	the website instructions are confusing ( misleading so they can collect the $_000 charge at the gate ?).
negative	not a good experience !
negative	for us it is no more your service or frontier !!!
negative	especially when southwest is hassle_free !!!!!!!.

negative	i am still missing a $_000 air_compressor from my order from the 00st of last month & have not been able to reach anyone on the 000 # i have filled_out 0 separate online requests for help and have not gotten a call back , i will never order anything from this mickey mouse outfit again !
negative	the roses were so bad and so different from that were on the website
negative	they sent me the wrong parts which are axles and very heavy .
negative	it was 000_% their fault for sending the wrong parts because i looked up what i ordered and what i received was totally different .
negative	they refuse to pay for return shipping or even take the product back because the box was damaged in shipping .
negative	they should not be allowed to run a business .
negative	up yours partsgeek !!!!!
negative	!
negative	went online to find a storage place and found this place .
negative	said if you reserve via the web you get a special price , so i reserved via the web .
negative	i went there to sign_up for the space and was charge the exact_same amount as a walk in .
negative	i ordered fuel pumps from this website .. 0 of them to be exact ... 0_weeks_later i still have not received my order .
negative	i tried_contacting customer service and they got back to me via_email 0 days_later ( nobody picks_up the phone ) and they told me that they have cancelled my order because the " quantity seemed too large to avoid any mistakes "... doesn_'_t make any sense and total bull .
negative	i just think they did not have them in stock which was not indicated on their stupid website .
negative	overall , terrible experience and contacting them via phone is impossible .
negative	i would not recommend doing_business with this company to anyone .
negative	they sent the wrong part and it seemed that they wanted me to fix the their issue and try to find the correct part that i ordered wrong .
negative	when i ordered a part for a ford_f000 and they sent me a part for a honda odessy , their lack of respose or actually reading the e_-_mails that i sent was absolutely ridiculous .
negative	they finally listened to me when i informed them that i was contacting my credit_card company to cancel the payment on the order .
negative	i will not order anything from them again .
negative	in the future , i am going to make_sure that i only order from a company that has contact number where you can actually talk to someone .
negative	these_people are a real piece of work .
negative	i order a part .... they send me the wrong part , they want me to pay to send the wrong piece back to them so that i can get a refund on the piece i did not receive !
negative	these_people have not clue to the meaning of customer service .
negative	i was never able to speak with anyone ..... all email communication ..... 00_% of which were just automated_responses and obviously not read .
negative	i would not recommend doing_business with these_folks under any circumstances .
negative	i booked a hotel in west little rock through this website .
negative	my usual hotels that i stayed in were booked due to the president visiting town after a tornado hit a nearby city .
negative	i checked into this hotel that had descent reviews online .
negative	it was filthy and nasty !
negative	i checked out immediately and found a nearby hotel in another city approximately 00 miles_away .
negative	i am still battling the return on my credit_card .
negative	hopefully the part is good .....
negative	still dont have it 0 days_later .....
negative	ground_shipping is 0 - 0 days wtf
negative	the computer i received did not operate with an hdmi lead as requested , the computer was returned and i was told there was nothing wrong with it .

negative	ordered a part that was shown as in stock .
negative	received an_email_confirmation of order .

negative	very poor communication and just_plain rude !
negative	received cheap plastic replacement parts .
negative	will never use this company again .
negative	posted a blog also parts are cheap crap china shit .
negative	there may have been a day when priceline was a valuable website , but it appears that those days are past .
negative	with so many other travel websites available , i would definitely not recommend this site .
negative	in times past , i have used priceline occasionally and with good success , but my most_recent experience with them was not very positive at all .
negative	after booking a hotel in the philadelphia area through " name your own price ", i found the reviews of the hotel disturbing .
negative	from bedbugs to dirty rooms to broken water faucets to poor customer service -- it really concerned me that priceline would recommend this hotel at all , much less as a 0 . 0_star plus .
negative	i called customer service , and after_speaking to a csr , i was transferred to another department .
negative	there geraldo listened to my concerns , and then placed me on hold in order to call the hotel .
negative	over 00_minutes later , he returned to my call to tell me that the hotel guaranteed that they did not have any bedbug issues recently .
negative	my only recourse was to contact the hotel manager on the next_day and ask for an exception so that priceline could refund my money .
negative	when i asked if this hotel had had any other complaints with bedbugs , gerald responded that he was not able to access that information .
negative	when i asked if i could speak to his_supervisor , claudia , i was told that supervisors do not take phone_calls .
negative	he did say that he was documenting everything and that he would present it to his management_team .
negative	it became obvious to me that in spite of the multitude of bad_reviews on several different websites ( which geraldo was unable to access because of the system that he utilizes ), gerald was unable to help me .
negative	( there was even one review that mentioned disbelief that priceline would recommend this hotel .)
negative	perhaps you would disagree , but i found the level of customer service quite disappointing .
negative	the next time we take a trip , i '_m definitely looking elsewhere .
negative	united overbooked and tried to bump me .
negative	they said they got a " smaller plane than_expected " , if you can believe that .
negative	then they didn_'_t tell me until i got to the gate which would have saved me a lot of standing in line .
negative	then we were late landing and i missed the wedding sunset cruise .
negative	on the way home , i went through houston and spent a total of 00_hours in transit from cabo to san_francisco .
negative	it was absolutely terrible .
negative	i arrived at my hotel at 0 :_00pm this was about 00_minutes after booking it .
negative	when i arrived the clerk wouldnt let_me check in because he hadnt received an_email_confirmation from travelocity .
negative	i showed him my email_confirmation on my phone with the conf # and hotel # and that still wasnt enough .
negative	finally after going back and forth on the phone with travelocity customer service and the hotel clerk for over 0 hours they received a fax with my hotel info .
negative	i finally was able to check in at 0 :_00pm .
negative	pathetic !
negative	unaccountable !
negative	excuse city !
negative	you have my money for 0 of the same parts since the first was packaged so badly the repair_shop said it was useless . i still don_'_t have the 0nd part i paid for & this is my main mode of transportation . i believe my attorney will suggest i send you the rental_car bill as well as storage fees for the s000 .
negative	what don_'_t you understand about making the consumer a priority vs . our policy states .............. b .. s . i want some sort of compensation whether it is a formal apology from an educated employee or a check for the rental & storage fees !
negative	disgusted ,
negative	dr kee
negative	website gave no place to access aaa or mariott rewards discount
negative	avoid at all costs .
negative	cost of service of no interest to me but having a trustworthy partner when booking a carrier to send items for a client is paramount .
negative	when a carrier fails to show yet again and after 0 . 00_minutes on a live_chat with customer service i come away in tears , exhausted , beaten down into submission ... there is little point to a chat service who do not answer a query point by point , ignore the query and instead just quote something else which is irrelevant to the query at you .
negative	they demand you look at t & c , and when you do and ask more queries they get upset with you .
negative	fact is i booked a parcel collection for today at cost of £_000 .
negative	stayed up all night to complete order for client .
negative	recd call to ask if parcel ready .
negative	i had booked for 0 - 0 . 00pm slot .
negative	this was 00am ..
negative	i said parcel still not ready would he still be coming at booked slot .. he said yes ... that was definitely a yes .. not no .
negative	at 0pm i went online to ask live_chat if courier still coming as still had no sleep for 00_hours .
negative	was told don_'_t contact them until after deadline has passed ie 0 . 00
negative	0 . 00 i go back on live_chat and ask where is he > am told he will not be coming .. not a guaranteed collection service .. should have booked premium interparcel even_though this is not available for this usa zip_code delivery address .
negative	they will rebook for tomorrow so stay in all day .
negative	i explain i have to go to appointment at 00am that was why i needed collected today .
negative	no acknowledgement of this whatsoever .. instead just asked .. anything_else !
negative	really ???
negative	they eventually came next_day at 0pm !
negative	no apologies nothng !
negative	very unhappy , as the parcel was estimated to be delivered 00th
negative	you sent me the wrong wiper bushings for my dodge ( the package said they would fit ., not even close ) so its raining and i am going thru snow in the mountains pulling my sticking wipers by hand thinking about parts_geek who i cant get_ahold of anybody i already emailed you and got no response
negative	i '_m disappointed to be frank .
negative	petflow asked me for donations to the everett washington animal shelter in the wake of the disastrous mudslides .
negative	i foolishly obliged .
negative	never got a thank_you .
negative	no acknowledgement of the donation .
negative	just two_separate contacts from petflow thinking i was someone named everett .
negative	i have no_idea if the food i ordered was delivered .
negative	i feel_like i got scammed .
negative	never again .
negative	i will stick with my own charities .
negative	received the part within couple of days from order time .
negative	day i received the part i submitted for return .
negative	it has_been 00 days and still have not received any information from company to return unwanted part .
negative	have submitted two requests and two more replies and have heard_nothing .
negative	very unhappy .
negative	on their main page says returns 00 - 00_hours .
negative	i ordered a door_handle for my chevrolet van and parts_geek sent 0 for a ford and now i have to pay to ship it back .
negative	i will never buy from parts_geek again !
negative	i was very disappointed to have my order canceled when a item marked " in stock " was actually not in stock .
negative	i received an_email the next_day stating they had just sold out .
negative	i call bs .... the part is still showing to be in stock 0_weeks_later , not cool .
negative	never have recieved part , there shipping software is corrupted .
negative	never able to talk to a live_person .
negative	could have parts from south_africa by now , customer still_waiting .......
negative	i sent in my oakley_frames for some new lenses .
negative	it took_longer_than_expected to get them back , and when i did i felt dizzy when i wore them .
negative	i sent the glasses back along with my old lenses .
negative	the new lenses have a lot more curve in them than my old lenses .
negative	fd remade a set of lenses but they are about the same .
negative	all said it took about 0 months to get my glasses back with lenses that don_'_t work very well .
negative	i will never buy or recommend parts_geek to anyone and i know a lot of people who will agree ! your return_policy even if its your error is ridicoulous !
negative	having to pay to ship back something that wasn_'_t my fault is bad business on the companys part !
negative	not good business !!!!!!!!!
negative	you lost a lot of potential_customers for a few dollars !
negative	in a word you suckass !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
negative	!
negative	ordered flowers , they sent a cheaper item which my girlfriend didn_'_t like ( obviously pretended she did ).
negative	had to argue over the difference .
negative	they offered postage refund or the difference .
negative	they state a guarantee of refund or redelivery and came good on either .
negative	also took two_weeks to respond to complaint .... shows how busy complaints dept is !!!!!
negative	!
negative	i order a part it was mailed once package was here the inside bag was ripped took part to dealer had installed to fond out part didn_'_t work spoke with mr lee whom a used part out same day that part was used and didn_'_t work either so i spend 000 0st time and 000 the second time i now understand parts_geek doesn_'_t check electric parts wow
negative	after gaining full confidence in the company by talking to one of their sales_representative , i decided to have my $_000 electric sunglasses repaired , which had a broken hinge , with them .
negative	they assured me that the the repair work would be a solid long_lasting job .
negative	i was a bit_skeptical as the price estimate they gave_me was anywhere from $_00 -$ 00 ( a big range for an estimate on hinge damage who '_s lower end is given , i am convince in retrospect , as a bait and switch like tactic ) with a mandatory payment for return shipping being ( even if no work is done ) $_00 ( which is conspicuously high for sunglasses '_s shipping especially if the company has regular business with the shipper ).
negative	instead of simply buying new glasses , i figured i go for the repair so as to not be wasteful .
negative	long_story short , i got my glasses back which just had a strong adhesive holding the old hinge on and not surprisingly they broke within two months .
negative	being skeptical of the whole deal initially , i had purchased the " 0 year extended_warranty " out of the other choices of 0 or 0 year extended_warranties .
negative	when i spoke with a company rep about utilizing the warranty she said that it would be fine and my cost would only be only $_00 this time .
negative	what ?
negative	" yes " she said " you purchased the warranty for a reduced price if your glasses were to be repaired again ."
negative	i told her it was very misleading because i was under the impression the warranty was on the glasses not their repair rates .
negative	at this point she told me it was my fault for not doing enough research into it .
negative	i find it to be fraud when their warranties imply one thing ( and thus do not warrant further research ), but are in fact something completely different .
negative	i then asked her if she could guarantee the glasses wouldn_'_t break after two months again , she said that no in fact because of normal heat and the nature of the adhesive they would almost certainly break again .
negative	i asked her why i wasn_'_t informed of this vital information up front when initially talking with one of there sale reps ?
negative	she only shrugged it off saying that with my kind of glasses the adhesive not holding up after a repair is " common knowledge " and again it was my fault for not knowing .
negative	it certainly was my fault for giving almost $_00 to this company which did literally nothing but sell my a story in sales and took my money in accounting ; and now i know .
negative	so please heed my story and eschew their repair services , a " common knowledge " lesson i had to learn through my own failed experiences .
negative	tl_; dr every time you send a glass for repair it will most_likely cost you $_00 dollars .
negative	their repair work consisted of gluing broken parts with glue that you can purchase at the hardware_store .
negative	they will sell you a fraudulent extended_warranty and your glasses will almost certainly break again .
negative	the minibus turned_up dirty , proceeded to breakdown on way back from wales .
negative	no support available to get us or the people on the bus home .
negative	emergency contact phones were not answered and left to fend for ourselves .
negative	very poor level of service .
negative	i live in nc .
negative	former resident of pittsburgh pa .
negative	drove to pittsburgh for grandchildrens graduation .
negative	the air suspension compressor stopped_working . needed this part after checking prices and reading_reviews ordered part and wanted it shipped to my son '_s home in pittsburgh .
negative	this was a complete mistake they put order on hold could not talk to sales_rep . only email . 00 - 00 hour reply time after opening complaint . another 00 - 00_hrs . was given phone_number to call after waiting up to 00 min numerious times phone was picked_up and then hung_up right_away .
negative	experiance goes from bad to worse . to much to say other than never again .
negative	00
negative	ordered black_ops_0 for my son so he could play with his mates and guess who '_s copy didn_'_t turn up on release day .
negative	he was the only one who didn_'_t have his copy .
negative	emailed me to say it was shipped saturday , not sure about that to be honest .
negative	no point pre_- ordering anything if you dont get it for release day .
negative	it wasn_'_t as if it was really cheap either .
negative	this is not the first time this has happened so it '_s time to shop elsewhere
negative	all the parts i ordered were incorrect for my vehicle .
negative	the return_policy is a joke and it actually cost the consumer money when they make a mistake so parts_geek wins not matter what .
negative	they can ship whatever they want and still get paid .
negative	once the part arrives , it '_s basically your problem , and you pay the shipping back after you already paid inflated shipping to receive it .
negative	i would stay_away from this site .
negative	you are not saving a dime .
negative	it '_s a shame , this could be a good thing .
negative	also , there is never human contact .
negative	you delayed my order due to address shipping information .
negative	i fixed that .
negative	you never called me back you never verified anything and you canx my order after a solid week past .
negative	its really really bad .
negative	we bought the vip ticket one and we paid more than 000_euro .
negative	what we got a fuckin 00 euro .
negative	it arrived at the same day of the match .
negative	we contacted them but nobody picked it up and respond .
negative	never never never buy from this website again .
negative	no customer service to speak to on phone .
negative	no phone numbers and too_long to respond via_email .
negative	customer service stinks
negative	i ordered and paid for a nail clipper on 00 / 00 , and when i called to ask when it would be delivered , the answer was on 00 / 00 .
negative	when i remarked that it was an unreasonable delay i was informed that i could have chosen a quicker shipping method at additional_cost .
negative	so , it takes 0_weeks to put a nail clipper in the mail ?
negative	i find this type of delay unacceptable , and the argument that the clipper has to be sent from illinois is completely irrelevant .
negative	illinois is not on the other side of the world and can be contacted by email of phone .
negative	there is absolutely no reason that shipping should be delayed for nearly two_weeks .
negative	clearly i am being punished for not choosing another shipping method , one the company can make additional profit on .
negative	customer " service " suggested that i select a faster shipping method the next time .
negative	i will go them one better , however - there will be no next time concerning healthcare_supply pros , or more correctly , amateurs .
negative	such treatment does not deserve return business and they will_certainly get no such thing from me .
negative	we had a terrible experience there .
negative	there were bugs all through the room .
negative	the room stunk and the beds were hard . it ruined ruined our entire weekend .
negative	manager said he would eliminate the bugs and that did not happen .
negative	also tv controller did not work .
negative	i ordered a book form dualj on june 00 / 00 .
negative	it was the " crc handbook of chemistry and physics 00th edition .
negative	yes the book was a used book in " good or better " condition .
negative	on my paypal_account confirmation it even said .
negative	" crc handbook of chemistry and physics 0000 - 0000
negative	item # gd0000000000 $_00 . 00_usd 0 $_00 . 00_usd
negative	so i was expecting to receive just that .
negative	much to my surprise .
negative	what i received was the " handbook of chemistry and physics 0000 - 0000 edition .
negative	this is not okay !
negative	i tried to contact dualj , and all i could get was their website which i had to log in at , but when i entered my account and password .
negative	they didn_'_t even know me .
negative	i tried everything to get logged on .
negative	i entered every number that there was on my order confirmation e_-_mail from dualj , to no_avail .
negative	i entered a complaint with paypal , who talks good , but apparently their policy is that they could sell me any edition of the same book no mater how old , and it would be just fine .
negative	an_older novel of the same title would be the same , but a book like this one sold under a different edition is entirely a different matter .
negative	i have two earlier editions of this book already .
negative	both of which are far more current than the one that they sent me .
negative	never received confirmation from web_site .
negative	then ordered same car part elsewhere .
negative	then received e_-_mail from parts_geek confirming order .
negative	contacted parts_geek same day to cancel order .
negative	parts_geek said that they would have to ship part but that i could refuse delivery .
negative	i informed them that it would be silly to ship a part that i would refuse .
negative	they responded that that is their process .
negative	i informed them that i would dispute any charge to my visa .
negative	they said not to bother since this would delay my refund from them .
negative	i am pretty sure that they are attempting to stick me with the delivery fee and a restock_fee on a part i cancelled the same day .
negative	this will not happen !
negative	i refused delivery yesterday and will be disputing visa charge next .
negative	unable to talk to anyone at parts_geek .
negative	no reasoanble responses from them to date .
negative	i will have nothing to do with them ever again .
negative	i ordered a muffler and two muffler clamps , the muffler never arrived .
negative	i wrote to the company and never got a response .
negative	filed a complaint with usps and never got a response from them .
negative	called mastercard and they credited my account for the full_amount .
negative	thank_you mastercard .
negative	i will never use partsgeek again , the worst internet site i have ever used .
negative	i still have a big hole in my old muffler but the new muffler clamps do add some bling .
negative	partsgeek is a joke .
negative	not ordering from supplement_warehouse again .
negative	they did have fast shipping , but their return process is rediculous .
negative	they received my returm 0 days ago early in the morning and i still have not been refunded .
negative	they haven_'_t even found the package yet .
negative	0 out of my last 0 orders have been ' lost ' in the post .
negative	shopto will only give you credit and not a refund .
negative	you have to wait a full 00 working days before making a claim , by which time the item you want is out of stock .
negative	sorry but after booking i have checked my flight cost directly on lufthansa web_site and i discovered that there are seats still availaible 00 euro less per each .

negative	bought two tires after having a blow out after hitting a crater in the road .
negative	after receiving the tires within ten miles i began hearing a grinding noise .
negative	so i thought something was wrong plus the car was drifting bad to the left like the alignment was off .
negative	so i went back to the town_fair to see what was the problem .
negative	i specifically told the guy at the counter the problem , and to take a look at the tires .
negative	and if they were fine to let_me know if their was a brake shoe going or if they saw anything .
negative	they did something for 00 min .
negative	i got the text that they were done , and that my car was ok .
negative	i ask about the car or did you see anything and why the leaning .
negative	the front counter guy said they wrote knothing so everything must be fine and to take it , drive it around if still not right to come_back .
negative	as soon as i pulled back the grinding sound was a lot worse so i did a circle and went back .
negative	after the third time they looked at my car again , after i made a fuse about the situation they took the wheels off and found that the inner brake shoe on the front was wore down and damaged .
negative	you would think that after you pay almost $_000 . 00 for two tires that they would tell you that you might need to check your brakes , yet they put the tires on and say go on you merry way .
negative	yes i understand tires are your specialty but maybe slow down charge a extra fee like everyone_else does , and make_sure your customers will be safe when they drive off , not waste their time and endanger their families and others on the road .
negative	not tell them all they do is tires , charge a little more and keep people safe .
negative	that is what your customer expect .
negative	good tires and safety for their families .
negative	scum bags never write , pick_up phone and send wrong parts , and expect you to pay to ship their garbage back .
negative	in one way i thank them for wp showing me to the light , i will never offers another .
negative	autoparts online ever , real people are awesome computer suck
negative	oh_yea there is no zero star or i would give it zero
negative	having placed many many orders from my protein and always recieved the very next_day i was not expecting the following .
negative	i ordered on 00 . 00 . 00 a 0kg_bag of hurricane_xs mint choc and two lots of creatine tablets .
negative	i ordered the products on the 00 . 00 . 00 as i was due to run out of both products in a couple of days .
negative	after the 0th day had passed i started trying to contact my protein with several emails and phonecalls daily pleading for an explanation as i was becoming desperate to recieve my products but i got absolutley no response whatsoever not even a email .
negative	the phonecalls would be at_least 00mins long every day and quite often 00mins until i got fed up waiting and hung_up .
negative	i have been charged by my telephone provider several pounds .
negative	i aventually spoke to a member of straff after waiting 00mins again today .
negative	once staff looked into this they said my products had not even been dispatched from the warehouse yet as the hurricane_xs was out of stock .
negative	if i had not phoned today i would not have known that my products were out of stock .
negative	staff said what they will do is send me 0x0 . 0kg bags of hurricane which they had in stock ( dont_know why they did not do this straight_away ) and offered me £ 0 sumthing off the postage of my next order which is usually free anyway .
negative	the problem i now have is as you will be aware i will now need to restart my loading stage of creatine and hurricane which will not only cost me a lot more money now but has really had a big impact with my diet and training .
negative	i feel i have been very badly treated by my protein with no replys what so ever and if i had not phoned yet again today for another 00mins in total my products which my protein took the money in full out of my bank_account on the day of purchase would still be sitting in your warehouse .
negative	please could you respond to this email as i have been a customer for a long time now but after this i really do not feel that i can trust my protein with future deliveries which as you will be aware poses a problem for me with my strict diet and training routine .
negative	thanks
negative	upon reviewing flights for over two_weeks whilst traveling , it came time to booking and the flight i had been monitoring in particular ( berlin - chicago ) became unavailable as advised by the website .
negative	accepting that this was truthful information and that the blame was due to my timing more than anything_else i went_ahead and booked the suggested flight by skytours . com which was much more_expensive ( 000_pounds ).
negative	with this behind me the next_day i checked the skytours website again , only to find that my original and cheaper flight was again available , which was really upsetting .
negative	upon_contacting the customer service team all i received was a notification to say that a change in flight would cost me a further 000_euro .
negative	since this incident i have been in contact with the airline_directly and they have been much more helpful and informative on the matter .
negative	i fail to see myself booking through or advising anybody use skytours for any of their travel_arrangements from now on .
negative	cheers .
negative	i signed_up a pingo account thinking it might be useful since i was travelling but i was flat wrong .
negative	dumbest idea ever .
negative	i couldn_'_t get the toll - free number listed on their website for japan to work at all despite calling via mobile or from landlines .

negative	currently trying to get my money back through paypal as they will not respond or offer any refund
negative	you can '_t talk to customer service .
negative	email us and we '_ll get back to ya in a couple of days .
negative	i was sent an open box with missing gaskets and the wrong water_pump .
negative	a company with these policies should not be in business .
negative	stay_away from this company !
negative	you seem to simply be a portal .
negative	you made many statements that were not true - such as being_able to receive all documentation from the insurer by email .
negative	you also stated to me that email communication with the insurer would be possible .
negative	neither are the case and you '_ve caused me a huge amount of trouble and great undue burden ( as defined by the commonwealth of virginia ).
negative	i don_'_t know if you ' re a licensed broker in virginia , but , if not , the scc will know .
negative	i sent an_email to support @ stamps . com several days ago , explaining the reasons for our extreme dissatisfaction , and have yet to receive a response .
negative	in addition to two other support issues , our main cause of dissatisfaction is that we used stamps . com for a first_class mailing to 000 recipients 00 days ago , with absolutely the correct postage , and not a single recipient has yet received that mailing .
negative	the mailing had a time value , and contained an expensive brochure .
negative	the only explanation we can find is that someone at usps didn_'_t recognize stamps . com stamps as legitimate u . s . postage stamps .
negative	in such a case , i think it is reasonable to expect stamps . com to use their usps contacts to initiate an investigation .
negative	but our email to support @ stamps . com was not answered , and no such cooperation was offered .
negative	meanwhile , we have replaced the mailing , with the same postage , but dropped at a different post_office , and the replacement mailing was delivered by usps the very next_day .
negative	so , we are out - of - pocket over $_000 from that one incident .
negative	we do not intend to use stamps . com again .
negative	yes you read that right .
negative	i ordered a new motorola bluetooth for my cell_phone and not only did it arrive in an envelope without its original packaging , the previous_owner left me some disgusting nasty ear crud on it .
negative	they said i could return it , if i paid for shipping and a restocking_fee !!!
negative	never ever again .
negative	they lied in the listing , and then wanted to charge me to send it back .
negative	bad bad business .

negative	i have had great luck with the parts i have purchased in the past .
negative	if this poll had been sent after someone had addressed my problem i would have posted 0_stars .
negative	i filled_out a claim on wednesday and no word by monday .
negative	the next_day or two should be sufficient .
negative	to at_least tell me what you will do about a defective_part .
negative	i held on the phone for sales but i ran_out of time after about twenty min .
negative	i ordered a part off your site they sent me the wrong part then when i want to return it i called and talked to rob he said he would take_care of it 0 days_later i called again and he said they don , t have the part and he would send me a rta and he did i checked the site and the part i need is still in there i am sending the wrong part back keeping my recipt if my acc is not credited or you don , t send me a check i will call again .
negative	i will not shop_here again and tell my friends not to shop_here
negative	sadly , you would think that when you order a product as_described that it would come to you as_described .
negative	that is not the case .
negative	instead , you order a code for a uv copy and it only come in itunes … on any continent .
negative	of course the next logical thought would be to simply get a refund for the mistake but that is not the case .
negative	instead you have the option to allow the company to " re - post " the code for purchase and then after that code is purchased again and finally redeemed , they will offer you an in store credit .
negative	for a mistake they made .
negative	this company will respond to your support tickets but there is no flexibility or care to the customer .
negative	instead you only option is take what little they are willing to give you or nothing at all .
negative	i opted for the nothing at all .
negative	there is no reason to have a " store credit " with a company who can '_t back up their products or even simply list them right in the first place .
negative	it '_s a shame really .
negative	while the transaction only cost me about 0 . 00 in us dollars the principal of the transaction remains now a life lesson .
negative	i would not recommend this company to anyone without getting very clear detailed policies on their returns when they screw something up .
negative	i ordered my ticket to see jason aldean earlier this week and the concert is this saturday october_00th and have still not received my ticket .
negative	its an e ticket which is supposed to be emailed to me and they are usually sent immediately after order confirmation .
negative	viagogo '_s help says im supposed to receive it 0 days prior to the event but its 0 days before the event and i have emailed them and called and i haven_'_t heard_anything back yet .
negative	so im pretty sure i got scammed .
negative	after booking and paying for my travel i was not given an itinerary for my trip .
negative	i was unable to reach anybody on the phone .
negative	the next_day i had to sign_up for call back service .
negative	when i finally got my travel info i was unable to reserve my seats on the plane .
negative	i was however offered to upgrade my seats at a much higher price than what i was promised .
negative	i still have no confirmed seats and have to worry_about my family being spread out though - out the plane .
negative	travelocity nor delta were able to confirm my seats that i have all ready paid for with out pinching me for hundreds of extra dollars .
negative	lie , cheat and i reported them for credit_card fraud .
negative	place order and when i checked out they doubled my order , i notified them immediately but they refused to fix it it and said they were going to charge restock_fee if i sent the part back .
negative	my bank credited me and reported them
negative	scheduled a courier collection with interparcel .
negative	waited all day and finally rang at about 0 . 00 to check .
negative	response was that collection could be anytime up to 0 . 00 .
negative	waited_until 0 . 00 and rang - guess what interparcel close at 0 . 00 !!
negative	so they have my money , i still have my parcel and the only helpful adive i was given - which i should have taken up - was - " you can always cancel your order if you ' re not happy ".
negative	well there '_s helpful then .
negative	so now i have to wait_until monday to either re - schedule or get a refund .
negative	never again - will find alternative sources for courier quotes
negative	i have been trying to send two parts back for two_weeks , i have called the number they gave_me to call and never answers the phone !!!
negative	so i have emailed and still get nothing !
negative	i have done a lot of business with them in the past and never anything like this !!!
negative	so i '_m still_waiting to hear from someone 00 / 00 / 0000 !!!!!
negative	!
negative	i tried to cancel two hours after making a reservation only to find out it would cost me 00 dollars just to cancel .
negative	it takes a second to remove the fund from your card but an act of congress to put it back , minus a fee
negative	very disappointing experience .
negative	ordered an eibach front and rear camber kit for an infiniti g00 .
negative	received the kits in a timely_manner .
negative	the rear kit seems to be complete .
negative	the front kit , which should include 0 upper_control_arms with hardware for each side , had only 0 upper_control_arm and no hardware .
negative	going on 0_weeks since i received the parts and nothing has happened .
negative	i have been somewhat fortunate to be dealing_with a guy_named jason who has_been making attempts to correct the situation .
negative	but , if you try to call the customer service number they publish , you will never get in touch with anyone .
negative	this is definitely the worst experience i have ever had with an online vendor over the past 00 years .
negative	i had very poor experience with partsgeek . com .
negative	first off , i accidentally ordered the wrong part and immediately tried to stop it .
negative	but , i was told that they couldn_'_t do that .
negative	then , i repeatedly tried to get them to resolve the issue after receiving the wrong part and requesting a return invoice number .
negative	however , no one seemed to act like they knew what i was talking_about .
negative	next , i was asked if i wanted to purchase the right part .
negative	of course , i didn_'_t want to do that until we settled the return on the wrong part .
negative	finally , i threatened to check into my rights with my credit_card and possibly the better business_bureau .
negative	that '_s when someone actually sent me a number with very specific wording that if i didn_'_t follow it to the exact instructions apparently i wouldn_'_t get my refund minus a 00_% restocking_fee .
negative	i '_ve sent the part back and it was received on feb . 00th .
negative	unfortunately , they haven_'_t contacted me yet and no word of my credit_card being refunded .
negative	this has_been one of the worst customer service nightmares of my life .
negative	i bought many items recently , but lost one item once , two items the other time .
negative	that is too often , so i did not satisfy with service of this company
negative	website registration was fine and simple .
negative	this misled us as to what was to come .
negative	after finding the parking garage we realized we had parked there before when going on a previous cruise and felt good about it .
negative	wrong !
negative	we were transported to the cruise port in a van that was nothing_short of a wreck going some place to happen .
negative	no ac , doors were about to fall off , seats were filthy and stained , the whole interior was filthy and uncleaned for who_knows_how long , the inside smelled of body odor and the driver was messing with cellphone during the drive .
negative	the return was no better just different van in similar condition and different driver and which we had to call for to pick us up after being told at drop_off they would be running every 00_minutes at our return .
negative	they were the junkiest outfit making deliveries to the cruise port .
negative	one person wished us good luck when he found out we were waiting for pickup because they had used them last_year and waited two hours for pickup before finally using a taxi service .
negative	need to fire the delivery service people and get new vans !
negative	btw this was at the miami cruise port .
negative	my experience with partsgeek . com was not good .
negative	i ordered floor_mats for a toyota_corolla and got mats for a honda .
negative	when i called to voice my complaint , the person failed to allow me to finish before being interrupted .
negative	in addition to that , having to return them was an experience by itself .
negative	numerous rules and stipulations made it very unfriendly to me .
negative	it was like it was my fault this happened and if i missed any step in this return_policy , my whole credit would be refused , on the packing_slip it mentioned that they could not be returned without first calling .
negative	problem was there was no phone_number on the slip .
negative	partsgeek played this off as they were not responsible for this as this was a warehouse thing and they had no control over it .
negative	i purchase many things over the internet and this is one of the worse experiences i '_ve encountered in quite_sometime .
negative	your shipping sucks .
negative	i filtered flights to leave between_0am and 0pm and a flight at 00am which i purchased .
negative	this caused me to miss my flight and customer service including a supervisor told me i was our of luck and would not help me rebook .
negative	i re booked my flight directly with us airlines in a matter of minutes .
negative	i will not use your service in the future .
negative	they tried to screw me .
negative	my daughter had an accident and i could not leave on time and when i tried to reschedule with some guy in india it was miserable - a $_000 change fee plus $ 0 , 000 extra dollars for the flight ?!?!?
negative	!.
negative	i ended_up going to expedia and booking a one way flight for $_000 .
negative	it was a joke .
negative	without some kind of compensation i '_ll look_elsewhere for travel booking websites .
negative	you sent me an_email_saying that the radiator_fan i need to finish my front_end clip was sent on january 0 .
negative	i have received a dozen parts from you and they are fine .
negative	however , i am stuck in a rent – a – car until someone in your outfit can find the radiator_fan that i need to both began and end putting the car back on the road .
negative	i literally need the one part .
negative	i submitted a " ticket " as instructed on your customer service page and received an_email_saying you would get right on it then another one saying you were canceling my " ticket " because i had tried to submit another ticket .
negative	the first human_being i spoke to there said i had to track it through the shipper ; however , you sent it to holland ( supposedly ) who subcontracted it to a third - party shipper who subcontracted it to another third - party shipper .
negative	i have spoken to all of them and none of them have received the radiator_fan , so they say .
negative	help !
negative	rich riffe , telephone 000 – 000 – 0000
negative	two of the three items i ordered online weren_'_t sent because they were " out of stock ," and this company refuses to back order them - a policy conspicuously missing from their advertising .
negative	amazon manages to keep their computer inventory current - why can '_t oldies ?
negative	i ended_up paying six dollars shipping on a twelve dollar order .
negative	what a ripoff .
negative	they graciously informed me that i was free to re - order the other items ( and pay more shipping ), without_any assurance that they ' d be available .
negative	fat chance .
negative	one definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over , while expecting different results .
negative	i may be dumb , but i '_m not crazy .
negative	my $ and i will go elsewhere .
negative	i ordered a speaker system on dec . 00 0000 .
negative	was promised it would be rec ' d by christmas day .
negative	it was not .
negative	called one week_later and was told it was on back order .
negative	called today and was told they are not getting any more in and that my credit_card would be refunded .
negative	this is one of the worst companies i have ever done business with .
negative	my cc was charged and no one was planning on contacting me and telling_me anything .
negative	i spoke with numerous people and was passed around with the hopes i would just hang_up .
negative	after being told to basically deal with it .. my credit_card is being refunded ( so they say , i will check this daily ) and i am left without the product i ordered a month_ago !!!
negative	rude employees who huffed and puffed and raised their voices at me and just didn_'_t care that they are in the retail business and can '_t provide products to paying customers .
negative	i will never deal with them again and i warn you all to not !!!!!!!!!!
negative	!
negative	double_billed for airfares , which amounted to over $_000 .
negative	contacted customer service , which probably is a call servicing center in who know where , & was promised a refund .
negative	waited more than a wk .
negative	w_/ o any action whatsoever by travelocity .
negative	more than a wk .
negative	ago , again contacted customer service , & was promised travelocity would contact airline .
negative	have as yet heard_nothing from travelocity .
negative	travelocity is , at best , incompetent , or dishonest , worst case .
negative	will never again book travel through travelocity .
negative	i ordered 0 parts and it stated ups so i used my physical_address .
negative	one part shipped via mail usps and was returned because my mailing_address has a po_box .
negative	i missed my job interview and still have no part .
negative	part geeks still has not contacted me or returned my communications .
negative	your site told me i ' d have my dog_food discounted and it would arrive in 0 day .
negative	it didn_'_t ... plus fedex lost my package .
negative	this was not worth the 0 dollars i saved from just going to the store by myself .
negative	a complete_waste of my time .
negative	ordering on line was easy and contact with 000 was helpful and i would give the experience 00 out of 00 , however once the delivery company was involved , or at_least the 0 idiots who turned_up with the delivery things dropped to a minus 00 .
negative	we have recently_moved to a new address and have come to realise that it is somewhat_difficult to find for deliveries so we have produces a set of directions which we email to companies for the information of their drivers when making deliveries .
negative	we did this once we had confirmation from 000 that the item had been sent out .
negative	on the day of the delivery the arrogant , rude and ignorant duo who dropped of the item could not have been more unpleasant , both when they called my wife and later when they eventually turned_up .
negative	i would suggest that 000 address this with their delivery agents as this has marred what otherwise would have been a smooth and easy transaction .
negative	my mother was dying and i needed to change my flight to get to her early .
negative	i called travelocity and was on hold for over 0 hours .
negative	it was so bad i call on my cell about 00_minutes into the hold .
negative	i had both calls on hold for more than a hour more .
negative	i responded to the follow_up by travelocity and got a form email .
negative	in the end i called delta directly and it cost me .
negative	$_000 to change the stupid flight .
negative	no .
negative	i did not have a good experience .
negative	this site is a bogus intermediary that charges extra fees .
negative	if you book and cancel , they will delay refunds for a month or more .
negative	book directly with the hotel , save_money and enable reasonable refunds .
negative	do not use this company .
negative	i already reported their bad business_practices to american_express and asked american_express to dispute the charges .
negative	0 days for shipping is it late i pay fot 0 o 0 days delivery
negative	ordered on a monday , waited two_weeks .
negative	still no show ,
negative	sent supplyer a email , to be told was waiting for new stock and it will be another two_weeks ,
negative	if i had not of chased it up i would still not be any the wiser .........
negative	did not receive the mirror i ordered .
negative	tried_calling 0 times never could get through to talk to a customer service rep . long wait queue an got rolled over to voicemail and the main_menu each time .
negative	after several hours of trying to speak with a live_person i gave up .
negative	then filled_out claim / complaint form online .
negative	still have not from anyone regarding my order and non_- delivery of my order .
negative	out $_00 plus bucks plus shipping and no mirror to show for it .
negative	only_thing i have at this point is lots of frustration over this order .
negative	woul have been better off paying $_000 to buy the mirror and could if had it the next_day .
negative	shipping choices were none - only option was usps .
negative	horrible !
negative	i wanted to order a pool heater from them and found an identical heater on line $_000_dollars cheaper so i called and after spending a lengthy time on the phone will they gathered the information i was told someone would call in 00_hours to let_me know if they would match the price when i got no call back i called again and this time they told me that it would take 00 to 00_hours to confirm the price match or not .
negative	said they only had 0 people to do price_matching so i no_longer will shop at this company .
negative	ordered a " direct replacement " power_steering cooler for my truck .
negative	it wasn_'_t even close to be a direct replacement .
negative	it was half the size of the oem cooler and had the wrong_size hose connection .
negative	and , it took 00 days to get a part they said was in stock .
negative	no , i '_ll never use parts_geek again .
negative	i bougt a 00pc .

negative	i am an account holding mcm customer ( tv repair_shop )
negative	parts arrive at different times making my auto project difficult .
negative	would not purchase again .
negative	won_'_t use .
negative	tried to verify my account several_times ... no joy .
negative	the parts i order took a long time to get and when i got the parts they all bent up .
negative	good experience ordering from better_bathrooms but totally spoiled by delivery .
negative	told on the 0 may that order was dispatched .
negative	eventually informed it would be delivered on 0 may .
negative	stayed in all day no delivery .
negative	phoned to query and told it would be delivered today am .
negative	we shall wait and see !,
negative	would i order again from bb ?
negative	yes if delivery service was brought into the 00 century .
negative	i won_'_t use your ink .
negative	unsubscribe me .
negative	i have bought 0 pair of marchon flexon frames and both have broken on bridge nose piece without being damaged in any way .
negative	both_times were not too_long after having new lens installed and both had been obsoleted by marchon .
negative	the frames were both only one year_old .
negative	after second_pair broke , i called marchon about the possibility of finding a frame so i would not have to buy new lens that had just been replaced .
negative	company rep . would not even talk to me without me filing a credit app .
negative	with them .
negative	great way for a company to cooperate with their customers .
negative	will never buy another marchon frame ever .
negative	also talked to my optomitri
negative	st and told them that they will lose customers if they keep supplying such frames as marchon !!!

negative	what a waste of a day , currys were supposed to deliver a fridge_freezer to day betwwen 0 . 00 and 00 ; 00 .
negative	of course by 00 : 00 there was no sign of the delivery .
negative	rang to ask were the delivery was and was told it would be in half an_hour as it was scheduled as number 00 on the route and the driver was at number00 .
negative	at 0 : 00 still no sign , rang again and told in the next half an_hour .
negative	the whole_process repeated at 0 : 00 ..
negative	finally at 0 : 00 the delivery arrived .
negative	this late delivery caused problems as i had appointments from 0 : 00 onwards which had to be cancelled .
negative	to make_matters worse the fridge when unpacked had scratches down the side which would be visible when installed .
negative	the driver stated that the item could be sent back or a refund given .
negative	rang currys and was offered £_00 , less_than 00_% of the item price , despite the fact that it would cost currys more than that to take the item back and replace with a new fridge_freezer .
negative	told to ring tomorrow and speak to a manager if i wanted a bigger discount .
negative	i can not afford to take more time off work so i am not at all happy with the service provided by currys .
negative	i would give the company zero_stars or a negative star_rating if i could .
negative	i will_certainly be looking else where when i next buy electrical goods
negative	no o ne anposn a s the phone when you call !
negative	i guess they don_'_t want to speak with anyone since they don_'_t post number on their website .
negative	i wanted to request express shipping but since it was not offer on their website i needed to speak with someone
negative	got the wrong part , didn_'_t fit my car , i just threw in the garbage , i paid $_00 and i didn_'_t think it was worth the trouble of shipping it back and all , sorry but i will never buy from geek again
negative	i received a new_mood 00 pill bottle , yes , nearly a hundred_dollars .
negative	the seal was broken and they don_'_t smell normal .
negative	onnit never responded , so i '_m going to cancel my automatic_reorder every 00 days of the new_mood .
negative	i don_'_t like being ignored .
negative	joe_rogan said " we don_'_t want you to feel_like you '_ve been ripped_off !"
negative	and being ignored while you keep my money while i have a defective product is like being_ripped_off .
negative	horrible experience .
negative	useless customer_support .
negative	i bought a door_handle and it broke off after a few uses .
negative	i '_m supposed to pay the return shipping on the junk they sell .
negative	told them i would not pay return shipping , they never responded .
negative	stay far , far away from this company .
negative	my order was supposed to be delivered in berlin on december 00 and it never happen , while my credit_card was charged right_away !
negative	i did notify your customer service immediately , but up to now , i still have no resolution of this problem and if i don_'_t hear from your customer service within one day , i will have to file a charge dispute with my credit_card .

negative	the reservation i tried to make was misrepresented to me and i did not receive what i asked for .
negative	when i tried to get the reservation corrected i was routed from a representative in central_america to two different respresentatives in the philippines .
negative	my outcome was that i cancelled the reservation and am expecting a refund to my credit_card .
negative	hopefully , this is what happens .
negative	i made a mistake by mistyping my family name .
negative	i called them numerous_times and was fobbed of by the call handlers that it would be taken_care of " just wait " nothing has_been done .
negative	my last call told me a charge of 00 € which i was happy to pay but still they could not do anything .
negative	they are completely incompetent when it comes to changing anything .
negative	but super good at charging you for unwanted travel_insurance and debiting the credit_card as soon as you hit go .
negative	avoid them at all costs
negative	well as i can see from all of the bad_reviews , im not the only one with a bad review !
negative	!
negative	this company is what we call in the building trade a cow boy .
negative	what a waste of space .
negative	ordered flowers for guaranteed delivery for yesterday and they have only just arrived .
negative	i paid_extra for tracking but that didnt go live until today !!!
negative	like in the title it would of been quicker to get my turtle to go and pick them up for me than this company sending them .
negative	due to my wife working away a lot valentibnes is our day together and as they are late she will not get to see them now until they are in the bin dead .
negative	dont even bother trying to ring this company it either rings out or go to voicemail .
negative	i have even tried to email and im still_waiting of some sort of response from them !!
negative	!
negative	i am very sure that this company will be out of business very soon .
negative	so if your after flowers do not use this company .
negative	i paid over £_00 for flowers and they failed there side of delivering for valentines_day .
negative	i am demanding a full_refund as they did not fulfill there side of there agreement to deliver .
negative	also to all the other bad reviewers if you do not receive a full_refund please contact your card issuer because you might be able to get a chargeback .
negative	i have already rang mine and they 00 days to refund mine or they will do it for me .
negative	so please stay_away from this company
negative	you can '_t believe that i had a hotel booked for 0 nights and did not get to stay one night because i missed the first night .
negative	when i called for night 0 i was informed because of using your service which i thought had secured my room for 0 nights was not true and lost my room for the next 0 nights .
negative	what a way to pay or not pay for my room .
negative	thank_you for ???

negative	i made the reservation by calling your " toll_free " number from germany ( it '_s not " toll_free " when calling from outside the united_states .
negative	), after_speaking for 00_minutes and providing all the required information i was told my reservation was complete .
negative	i received the reservation and noticed that my middle initial was listed as a " d " when it should have been an " g " and then the wrong dates were listed ( 00 - 00 july_0000 ) instead of what i requested 00 - 00 june_0000 .
negative	i replied to the reservation email and never got a response .
negative	additionally , the reservation system does not recognize the military postal_system ( apo_/ fpo ), so i couldn_'_t use any of my credit_cards associate with the military mailing_address .
negative	no point explaining why as they have all bad feedback removed from this site .
negative	if you are lucky_enough to see this before it '_s removed be warned .
negative	in reply to the trust_pilot comment below ( i cant add comments on here its like witchcraft or something .
negative	you removed my post for 0 days , just enough time to have it drop so_far down the page no one can see it due to and i quote a bug in your system .
negative	email attached :
negative	sandra , jun 00 00 : 00 ( cest ):
negative	hi ,
negative	i '_m very sorry , we have had a bug in our system so i think that is why you kept receiving the email .

negative	kind_regards ,
negative	site wanted personal info from me , copy passport bank_statement ....
negative	sorry no dice .
negative	bad_reviews against cj '_s are removed and after 0 days mine has not been reinstated so read from that what you will .

negative	the service and support was almost none existent .
negative	i felt_like the only way i got anything done was to call and initiate the process .
negative	i wanted for over 0 months to get my glasses fixed .
negative	they sent me a pair about a month_ago and had made the left lens wrong .
negative	after complaining to a customer service rep .

negative	for me it was too little to late .
negative	i will never use them again .
negative	i ordered kyb_shocks that were in - stock according to the product page ; however , 0 days_later after receiving a confirmation_email i received a cancellation email with no_explanation .
negative	sweet customer service !
negative	please disconnect your toll_free line since you don_'_t answer but your on hold music plays well .
negative	i have called your company 0 different times and dates .
negative	i was on hold by machine but no one answered and or picked_up my call .
negative	you have lost so much business from me in the last 0 days .
negative	website sucks , customer service is worth .
negative	sent wrong parts , wouldnt send return shipping lable , said they will charge restocking_fee .
negative	i will be filing a cc dispute if they charge restocking .
negative	ordered a bbq and had no confirmation_email for three_days .
negative	i was then emailed to say my order was dispatched .
negative	shortly_after i was emailed with a request to ring them and arrange delivery ?
negative	i rang and was told it was dispatched and being delivered thursday .
negative	i was then contacted to say it wasn_'_t dispatched and when do i want it delivered !!
negative	i said friday please .
negative	it arrived thursday !
negative	on top of all this they charged me three_times which put me over my credit limit and i '_m still_waiting for the extra payments to be removed .
negative	absolute shambles .
negative	you have been warned !
negative	!
negative	i don_'_t know where or who picked the parts i ordered for my car .
negative	one out of two right is not good and way to slow on returns .
negative	then the phone customer service is very poor not one call back .
negative	ordering glasses from globaleyeglasses . com has literally been the worst purchasing decision that i have ever made - from false_information provided on the website , to dealing_with customer service , to never even receiving my order .
negative	from what i have experienced , i hope no one ever purchases anything from the company ever again , and if you choose to , know that you '_ll never receive your order .
negative	my first problems with the company came through a shipping discrepancy .
negative	i '_m a traveling professional , so delivery times are important to me .
negative	i checked the website thoroughly before deciding to make a purchase .
negative	i '_ve ordered from other online companies before and have never had any_problems .
negative	i noticed a discrepancy between the website and my order confirmation and brought it to the company '_s attention immediately after receiving my order confirmation .
negative	customer service never even listened or cared_about my concern for my order or the integrity of a company that lies to its customers .
negative	customer service never answered my requests via_email , nor did i ever get a phone_call back after leaving multiple messages .
negative	most_importantly , i ordered glasses and never received them !
negative	i asked for a refund and never received that .
negative	so now not only does globaleyeglasses . com lie to its customers , but the company also steals their money .
negative	absolutely unacceptable .
negative	tried to sell them a phone they took it in then quarantined the phone they couldn_'_t offer me explanation why i then had to phone another company at cost to myself they then said there was finance on the phone there wasn_'_t i then had to make several calls at cost again to myself they wouldn_'_t even give me the phone back took me about a week and lots of premium calls to sort it out they should have checked the imie before i sent it and warned me but no they took it in and then told me they was not interested in helping_me at all had to phone here there all premium_rate no money was offerd back would never use again not worth the hassle
negative	ordered 0 parts .
negative	received a tracking_number .
negative	0 part delivered .
negative	no way to find out where the other part is .
negative	no way to communicate with anyone about the issue .
negative	not sure if i will get the other part or credit .
negative	horrible communication system .
negative	not customer friendly .
negative	left in the dark about my order .
negative	get the impression these_folks are a fraud .
negative	jeg_købte_en citroën grand picasso i december .
negative	da_jeg_skulle hente den viste det sig at den ikke_var serviceret korrekt og en_anden model end angivet på papirerne .
negative	efter talrige forsikringer om at den ukorrekte service ikke_havde nogen konsekvenser , endte jeg med at_købe den alligevel .
negative	nogle måneder senere finder fdm en mislyd på motoren .
negative	nu hvor bilen ikke_har fulgt service , dækker almindelig kulance ikke længere - og pm olsen vil heller_ikke stå inde for deres løfter om ' ingen konsekvenser ' ved at dække som ved kulance .

negative	købte forleden et aiaiai pipe headset i hifi klubben i odense .
negative	ser ud som et kvalitetsprodukt , med lækre ledninger og betjening .
negative	lyden er dog under al kritik , bassen er ok , men øvre mellemtone og diskant er indelukket og lyder anstrengt .
negative	en_hel del ringere end mine tidligere creative til samme pris .
negative	bruger dem sammen_med iphone , ved ikke om_det_har noget at sige .
negative	i am out of the country and scheduled a delivery for the thanksgiving day , since that '_s the day of our_anniversary .
negative	i didn_'_t get any notice that the delivery cannot be made on that day and was certain that it made it , until i called to check the on friday_morning .
negative	to my surprise it was put on hold for an_alternative delivery day .
negative	i was upset but could hold it , until they told me that it '_s too_late to schedule for friday ( 00am is when i called ).
negative	i asked to schedule for saturday than .
negative	called on sunday to check for the order status , to find out that it was still on hold for an_alternative delivery day , since it appeared that all the florists in the area were closed for the whole weekend ?????
negative	wtf ???
negative	?
negative	seriously , never again .
negative	i signed_up for them for my tire chain business .
negative	it was working great although i did not like the already high $_000 per_month .
negative	since the business was seasonal , i cancelled for a few_months with the expectation i would likely come_back about october and start paying again .
negative	they restarted me without me knowing it and doubled the rate to $_000 .
negative	when i demanded a refund , they were not willing .
negative	i threatened to dispute the charge and so they finally gave_me the refund .
negative	they subsequently charged me again accidentally the next two months which they refunded quickly .
negative	they temporarily deleted 0 / 0 of my ratings .
negative	i took my business now to estorefeedback . com .
negative	we will see how that goes .
negative	$_00 per_month only .
negative	why does it take so long ?
negative	after 0 minutes i get an_email from world_remit .
negative	my transfer is in labor !
negative	account on my mastercard the amount is already debited .
negative	please tell me why the money is available after hours .
negative	?
negative	crooks and liars or just completely incompetent and unmotivated .
negative	it '_s hard to say which but i will never ever ever shop_here again ...
negative	i '_m ashamed to share air with the people that run this company .
negative	service in shop was excellent , however didn_'_t have curtains we required .
negative	ordered on the web , came within 0 days , however they ste sll twisted and mot mafe well .
negative	the curtains will have to be refinished at our cost as we require for christmas !!
negative	obviously no or poor quality control .
negative	really disappointed . jim sharp
negative	ordered 0 radiator_hoses a thermostat and gaskets and a radiator for a 00 gmc pickup .
negative	recieved the hoses and thermostat but no radiator .
negative	did a support_ticket after a few_days because i had no information where the radiator was .
negative	needed the radiator so i could use the pickup .
negative	put in another support_ticket , still no response !
negative	tried to put in another support_ticket and it was rejected ( too many )!!!
negative	finally threatened to cancel payment and was told it was out of stock .
negative	went to partsgeek web_site to see if i could reorder .
negative	the same brand was $_000 now instead of the $_000 when i ordered it .
negative	looks_like someone ( partsgeek ) screwed_up their pricing on their web_site and tried to cover their ass by saying there was a stocking problem .
negative	i ordered another radiator from another supplier because partsgeek has poor customer_support .
negative	my order was queued and did not get the items in the time specified on the website so had to go elsewhere as they were for a gift .
negative	i emailed them to request a refund but they sent me the keys anyway and said they do not offer refunds after the keys are sent unless they are faulty , despite me emailed them before i received the keys .
negative	i started a paypal_dispute and was offered a partial_refund of £ 0 . 00 ( was this some kind of joke ?).
negative	and paypal did not refund me the money as the items were intangible .
negative	lessons learned :
negative	don_'_t use this site but use others where security verification is automated
negative	don_'_t use this site as they seem to offer joke partial refunds
negative	know that paypal do not support you for these types of purchases
negative	it '_s really got my hopes up and then did not complete it '_s priority as an online_retailer
negative	i ordered the part , paid on line with my credit_card and waited for my order to arrive .
negative	that was the end of my good experience .
negative	pg offers no phone_number to talk to a human , you sent me the wrong part , then put me through hell to get a return_authorization .
negative	after 0 days of emails and demands on my part , you finally called and told me that you had credited my cc for the wrong part .
negative	i then told you i ordered the correct part from another_vendor so i would need a return_authorization .
negative	your company told me to dispose of the part and not worry_about returning it ?!
negative	so you send the wrong part , put me through hell to get an authorization to return , then after raising hell for a week you simply say ....." oh , just throw it away !"
negative	what a great company ......... not !
negative	i request an exchange for the lenses since it '_s too dark and i can '_t see well when i drive at night .
negative	i called customer service and left voice_mail at phone : 0 - 000 - 000 - 0000 ext 000 but no one returned my call .
negative	i want to exchange the lenses with clear one since the transition doesn_'_t go clear like the sales_person told me .
negative	order #_00000000
negative	such shitty " customer service "!!
negative	i only recieved half of my order .
negative	i ordered two headlights and only recieved one from ups .
negative	i submitted a ticket on the website to ask for them to contact me to resolve the problem ( their is no phone_number listed that i can just call to get service ) and nobody ever called me to resolve the problem .
negative	so i have one headlight and the other one i paid them for and the other one ????
negative	who fucking knows i guess i '_m shit outta luck on that and they get to keep my money .
negative	hmm , doesn_'_t seem right .
negative	dishonest criminal excuse of a business !
negative	should be interesting to see if they even pay_attention to these reviews and call me back to make this situation right by giving me my complete order or refunding me my money that they took while failing to come through with their end of the transaction .
negative	i typed in the make and model of my vehicle and the part that came up was the wrong part .
negative	it did not fit and i plan to return
negative	it looks_like you are using the hotels actual site , but it '_s not .
negative	go to the hotels actual site and be sure it is correct !
negative	i had an_emergency situation less_than 0 hours after booking through this service and they refused to cancel or re schedule my reservation .
negative	customer service is terrible
negative	save_yourself the grief and use another site
negative	i must_say that i am very disappointed with partsgeek and will no_longer be ordering from them .
negative	i ordered and received a part from them and it did arrive in a decent_amount of time , but the part was wrong .
negative	while partsgeek does have a return_policy , you have to go through a great deal of emails with them to get a return_authorization .
negative	then , even_though it was their error , i am required to pay the return shipping_charges .
negative	now i find out that the credit that is to be issued to my debit_card can take up to 00 days .
negative	if they can charge a card right_away , i know damn well that they can credit it right_away so what it with this up to 00 day statement .
negative	so all in all , i do not have the part i needed , and lost almost twenty_dollars ( two shipping_charges ) shop at partsgeek and hope they send you the right part otherwise you take a loss by shopping with them .
negative	i ordered a simple part for my vehicle ( drivers_side_mirror ).
negative	i was very specific about the make , model and year .
negative	i was sent the wrong part .
negative	i explained to them via_e_-_mail about the situation .
negative	they responded that they would take the part back but i had to pay for return shipping .............. it was their mistake !!
negative	when i called them to try and speak with someone , i was on hold for 00_minutes .
negative	i will never order another part from them and i have told all my friends and family not to deal with this company .
negative	they have lost a lot of future business because of this .
negative	beware of paypal '_s unfair business_practices .
negative	they will hold on to your money as long as possible while they earn interest on the money .
negative	their motive is not protecting your money .
negative	their motive is taking as much of your money as possible .
negative	as a subsidiary of ebay , they are getting you every way possible .
negative	ebay charges a fee for selling goods and then you are forced to use paypal as your " preferred " payment provider and they take a cut .
negative	good luck with making a profit when they eat your revenue in big chunks .
negative	snake oil salesmen .

negative	after 0_weeks of earring to get my olive garden gift_card i finally called to find out where it was .

negative	i recevied my package , they never fit . there was no phone_number to call .
negative	i had to pay to return the wrong parts i really wanted to speak to someone about getting the right parts but no one called me like they were supposed to . now i have to wait to get my money back so don_'_t use this part house
negative	i was in the process of changing banks who were responsible for sorting all the direct debits , which they did and confirmed in a letter that all had responded saying they had received the details .
negative	littlewoods were included .
negative	i then received an_email 00 days after the direct_debit had been confirmed saying i ' d missed a payment and i was being charged £_00 , despite me checking my details on my littlewoods account which confirmed it had been changed .
negative	i contacted littlewoods where i was spoken to by a lady in collections and told that they had been informed after 0th_july , so it hadn_'_t been processed in time .
negative	the direct_debit was due to come out on the 00th .
negative	none of my other direct debits had any_issues over payments .
negative	if it was too_late , an_email or text ( which they send when a direct_debit is made or a statement is due ), would have sorted the issue .
negative	as it was , i paid my balance ( a grand total of £_00 including the £_00 charge and insurance ) and closed my account .
negative	very disappointed .
negative	still iam white for my goods i thing my packet lost so iam not very happy if you can do something for that let_me now
negative	thanks mike mpilias
negative	this company provides viagra at a high price , use it only as a last_resort .
negative	i made a $_00 purchase and within 00_minutes i was a victim of identity_theft for the amount of $_0k .
negative	thank_goodness my bank was on top of it .
negative	no more purchases from them for me .
negative	i '_ve been using myprotein for a while now and although they stock good products at great prices , my experience with customer_support has_been mixed at best .
negative	most recently i tried to place an order redeeming a gift voucher i ' d received for my birthday .
negative	as they were also running a promotion at the time i tried to use the promotion_code at checkout too .
negative	as it turns_out , their online system cannot accept two codes on the same order - so you are forced to use the gift voucher on full priced items only .
negative	in order to try and get some benefit from their promotion i had to split my order in two , which_meant i then had to pay delivery charges twice and lose the discount on half of my order .
negative	on reflection , i called them directly to challenge this and was told that it was unfortunate but their was nothing they could do since the orders were now already out for picking at their warehouse .
negative	however they were happy to point out that they could have easily handled both gift voucher and discount_codes together had i ordered over the phone .
negative	for an ' online ' retailer this seems kind of pointless and laughable .
negative	eventually after writing several follow_up emails they agreed to grant me a voucher for free delivery on my next order , which , in comparison to the value i lost from the delivery charges and discount_code was nothing more than a slap in the face .
negative	thanks myprotein , but i '_ll be shopping elsewhere in future .
negative	perhaps you should invest in an online system that works rather_than maintaining a call_centre and trying to shortcut customers at any opportunity .
negative	i bought several games off them a year_ago and had to do some anti_fraud stuff so i sent them what they asked for and it was done , they said i would never have to do it again
negative	now it asked me again to do some anti_fraud thing , it '_s asking me to send them a hand_written letter !
negative	so they want my hand writing , they want me to scan them a copy of my licence or id and a bunch of other stuff !

negative	the situation was resolved , but unlike the other times i have used your service , i was not thrilled .
negative	ordered 0 tires for my dually on 0 / 00 / 0000 .
negative	was sent an_email to leave a review 0 days_later .
negative	i am just now writing a review 0 / 00 / 0000 .
negative	not so happy my order still has not shipped .
negative	i was given no heads up had to call and see what was up .
negative	customer service stated they had 0 tires but where waiting on the other 0 ( not sure but thinking that 0 tires isn_'_t that hard of an order to fill not like i ordered 00 ) and the guy told me they should be shipped by monday .
negative	here we are on monday and again haven_'_t heard_anything , yet they were quick to send an_email to get my to review them ( not a good idea until the customer gets what they ordered ) my suggestion if you are on a timeline ensure they can accommodate .

negative	i spent almost 0 thousand pounds on a 0 . 0 carat grade ii diamond_ring of which the diamond quality was shocking !
negative	the diamond was full of black marks , only visible in certain lighting .
negative	when i called to advise i was told that the guide online on diamond quality states that there would be visible marks and i should have read it before ordering .
negative	when i asked if i could send it back i was asked had the item been worn which it had and was told that unless the item was in flawless condition it would not be taken back .
negative	clearly the diamond_factory have widely varying degrees of flawlessness ; one for sales and one for returns .
negative	i have since taken the ring to several jewellers one of which advised me " that if he sold this kind of ring for that kind of money he would have gone out of business a long time ago "
negative	if you are thinking of buying a ring online please don_'_t pay a little extra and buy one you have seen first !!
negative	sent via iphone so apologies for spelling .

negative	i reserved a rental_car through priceline when i had to travel for a family tragedy ( family_members airlifted to two cities ).
negative	under the circumstances i was unable to pick_up the car the first day .
negative	i called priceline and they were ( i thought ) great about it .
negative	representative said that a full_refund would be issued after they verified that i had not picked_up the car .
negative	i did not pick_up the car , but instead made other arrangements for travel .
negative	about one week_later , on the day i returned home , i received an e_-_mail from priceline asking me to call customer service .
negative	i called .
negative	the representative said the first representative made a mistake and that priceline absolutely positively would not refund my payment .
negative	she also refused to transfer me to a manager or supervisor or any other person .
negative	i will not use priceline again , for anything .
negative	you said no discount - you lie , hampton takes aarp
negative	we found out unfortunately that your " approved for $_00 . 00 onboard credit " means nothing , and you will be cheated out of the bonus unless you find a magnifying glass and read the small_print .
negative	when we_boarded ship we called travelocity and was told that nothing cold be done .
negative	we do not plan to ever book any travel with travelocity again and wish to removed from their email list .
negative	the officers at travelocity should grant themselves a big stock option bonus with the dollars being saved with this scam .
negative	it is truly brilliant .
negative	not only did this " company " partsgeek . com send me a faulty part that left me stranded 0hr 00mins from my home on a bridge , to top it off once i contacted them about the faulty part and how i wanted my money back they simply said that they have no policy that allows them to give me my money back .
negative	isnt that some bullshit .
negative	i greatly recommend to never , ever , ever , ever !
negative	buy from them , unless of course you want to get ripped_off and or have your car break down on you on a long drive far away from home .
negative	fuck this bullshit sham of a " company " and fuck who ever runs it !.
negative	parts were supposedly fedex ' d 00 days ago ; still_waiting for delivery without the courtesy of an advice .
negative	why fedex if it takes this long , usps would be quicker .
negative	flowers delivered at night of the day after i required .
negative	customer assistance very unavailing .
negative	i thought it was going to be a great experiance until they sent me two different headlights .
negative	i thought i may of ordered the wrong one but then looking at the invoice , i had it right , they had it wrong but then i spent the next week trying to get it fixed ... what is bad is they have no return_policy so even for their mistake , they want to charge you for the return ... and when trying to talk to a human , its next to impossible so everything has to be done by email which takes up to 00_hours and it was always on the back side when you received a response ... will after several agressive emails , i finally got a shipping invoice sent to me to return it but in the process , i had to reorder the part and pay for it again and they said it will be 0 to 0_weeks to be credited back for their mess up ... not good business as far as im concerned .
negative	the parts were good though once i finally got the correct ones ... best luck and hope you have a better experiance then i had with this company ...
negative	promised ex stock delivery only to inform_me after ordering that item was out of stock for a further 0 days .
negative	i tried to cancel but they told me that the item , miraculously , was now in stock again so i stuck with them only for delivery to fail again and i had to go elsewhere at the last_minute .
negative	a disastrous experience .
negative	would neither recommend nor use again .
negative	i ordered my glasses from here as this appeared to be the only site that had them in stock still .
negative	upon billing me for the glasses i was told two_weeks_later that they were on back order and would have to wait longer_than usual for them .
negative	over a month later and still no glasses , and response to emails is sparse and cryptic .
negative	discount of 00 per_cent offered but never received , and no real explanation as to why my glasses have taken so long .
negative	in future i will order designer_frames from more trustworthy sites such as toni and guy , where service is better and contact is easier .
negative	really disappointed .
negative	avoid if you want your frames quickly .

negative	first person i spoke to told me my client did not need to create a paypal_account to send me money no matter what the amount was ...
negative	i have now spent so many hours trying to process this damn money transfer it does not make any sense .
negative	they say they charge 0 . 0 % +$ 0 . 00 but they charged me 0 . 00_% + 0 . 00 minor difference but when it comes to money i want exact numbers
negative	the order for two ethernet switches was placed 00 / 0 / 00 with both items showing as being in stock .
negative	delivery promised within 0 - 0 days .
negative	no communication or goods so after_contacting wae on 0 / 0 / 0 and asking where my goods were i was told that one item was not in stock .
negative	eventually i asked for a refund and they said that i could not have one because the goods had already been dispatched .
negative	well they eventually sent one item on 0 / 0 / 00 .
negative	today ( 00 / 0 / 00 ) i checked the website and the other item was in stock so i requested that they dispatched the item or gave_me a partial_refund .
negative	they offered me a refund which could take 00 days .
negative	no effort to send me the goods .
negative	my advice is shop elsewhere especially if you actually need the goods you are ordering .

negative	i '_m stuck with it , due to policy .
negative	there is no way to have an active account with these_guys and not have your credit_card details on file .
negative	it is companies like this that increase the cost of credit ' cause there is so much online credit_card fraud .
negative	i like to have the cd in my hands , read the dust jacket , understand the music .
negative	do people really trust their music interest to a computer company , lets get real here .
negative	music is the way to a person soul and you going to trust that to an online store .

negative	i booked a " stay park and fly " package at the quality inn suites in toronto , i gave the booker specific instructions 0 night_stay 0 days parking to pick vehicle up between 0 and 0 am of the 0th day .
negative	they took my credit_card and emailed me a confirmation .
negative	the confirmation said nothing about a park and fly it was simply for a one night booking .
negative	that was when the nonsense really began i phoned and asked to speak to a supervisor i was put on hold for 00_minutes and then hung_up on i called back and spoke to mary a supervisor she put me on hold and said she would call the hotel to straighten it out she would be just a few_minutes ... you guessed it 00_minutes later their system hung_up on me i called back the next_day and after 00_minutes got mary again she said she was working it out and would email me ..... i called back that afternoon and spoke to another supervisor josh repeat day 0 called back spoke to another supervisor ronnie who finally informed me that they do not book park and fly packages i would have to deal directly with the hotel .
negative	i called the hotel_directly and they informed me that they have 00 people a day who think the have booked park and fly packages through expedia and that the desk staff had to deal with 00 irate customers a day who have been duped with this booking scam .
negative	needless to say i will never book through expedia again !
negative	you are using cookies instead of a session .
negative	so if there are two browsers open , items from both carts in two browsers end up getting added at the end of the checkout .
negative	i reviewed my items in one browser , satisfied with my selection , and hit the submit_button to pay , but it charged my credit_card for the items in the other browser .
negative	to make it even worse , you wouldn_'_t allow me to cancel it and reorder .
negative	you need better programmers who don_'_t suck .
negative	due to a glitch in the travelocity website , my reservation for a hotel in italy booked for the wrong date .
negative	i placed 0 separate phone_calls to travelocity and endured a total of 00_minutes of hold time attempt to have them assist me with rectify this problem .
negative	in each case i was cut_off during each call .
negative	when i was finally able to speak directly with a representative from travelocity ; i was assured that someone would contact me once they had contacted the hotel and attempted to rectify this situation .
negative	two_days after_hearing nothing from travelocity , i had to take it upon myself to communicate with the hotel in italy to amend my reservation .
negative	thankfully the hotel in italy was gracious enough to amend my reservation and re - book for the original dates without charging me for the “ non_refundable ” clause listed prominently when i booked on the travelocity website .
negative	my wife and i have many friends who travel extensively and you can be certain we will share with them our experience with travelocity .
negative	in addition , we never again will use this incompetent website for our travel needs .
negative	don_'_t trust stock or prices on this site
negative	my advice would be don_'_t order anything from this incompetent bunch .
negative	they will send the wrong thing .
negative	then when they cannot get their act_together to organize a return they will keep your money .
negative	do not buy any rebuilt gb fuel_injectors from partsgeek .
negative	i was sent 0 injectors , 0 of them with damaged pintel caps .
negative	0 were in factory_sealed bags , 0 appeared to be core_returns .
negative	guess they got mixed up ?
negative	anyway , you can '_t reply to any emails , there are no contact numbers , and the return shipping is on you !
negative	i bet the next person_who orders 0 rebuilt injectors for their 0000_nissan_maxima will get the same 0 i ordered .
negative	pretty bad if you have them out of your car waiting on the parts !!!!
negative	!
negative	i wanted to buy the official optoma projector ceiling mount .
negative	this is what was stated on the website .
negative	however on receipt of the item i realised it was a universal mount .
negative	they charged me £_00 instead of the £_00 this would have cost otherwise .
negative	it is too small an amount to bother over but bear this in mind when you buy from them .
negative	you might not get what you pay for !
negative	i ordered several items from play . com that were dispatched with hermes .
negative	patiently i waited following the tracking updates until i discovered that they were returning my items without even attempting to deliver them !
negative	below is the complete transcript from their site :
negative	00 / 00 / 0000 00 : 00 return - processed by hub
negative	00 / 00 / 0000 00 : 00 returned to sender
negative	00 / 00 / 0000 00 : 00 courier received
negative	00 / 00 / 0000 00 : 00 missort to incorrect courier
negative	00 / 00 / 0000 00 : 00 processed at depot
negative	00 / 00 / 0000 00 : 00 receipt at depot
negative	00 / 00 / 0000 00 : 00 hub sorter receipt scan
negative	00 / 00 / 0000 00 : 00 order generated
negative	so just because they gave it to the wrong courier they returned it !
negative	not once did they attempt to contact me to say , i had to speak with play . com in the end who gave_me a full_refund .
negative	this was not the first time that i have had the displeasure of dealing_with hermes and in the majority of these previous cases they have been as equally poor .
negative	do not use in any way shape or form !
negative	i place my order , but i saw for a 0 . 0 oz item i had to pay 0 . 00 in change for shipping
negative	when i thought i was booking my room with fairfield i find out differently at the hotel .
negative	from now on i will be sure i am using the correct site .
negative	my accounting_department refuses to reimburse me for online reciepts .
negative	missing screws and bolts from the monroe quick strut that i ordered .
negative	dealing_with customer service was very difficult i still did not get my nuts and bolts .
negative	i would prefer to have a root canal then deal with parts_geek customer service .
negative	waited too_long for my order was not happy about that
negative	i should not have you control my system of payment .
negative	flugladen . de mag ja ganz gut sein wenn_man kein problem hat .
negative	in unserem fall hat eine rechtliche spitzfindigkeit zu einer namensänderung derselben person geführt und_das ticket musste geändert werden .
negative	dieses innert nützlicher frist zu ändern war für flugladen . de ein ding der unmöglichkeit .
negative	obwohl sofort bemerkt und 0 tag später beanstandet vergingen über 0 wochen , etwa 00 telefonate hin und her mit_der fluggesellschaft und irgendwelchen inkompetenten callcenter - mitarbeitern in der deutschten pampa .
negative	flugladen schob der fluggesellschaft die schuld in die schuhe und umgekehrt .
negative	natürlich gab es während dieser zeit eine preisanpassung und natürlich wurde diese uns berechnet , selbstredend mit storno - und bearbeitungsgebühr .
negative	das wurde uns diskussionslos via_e_-_mail ( natürlich no - reply ) mitgeteilt , obwohl zuvor noch zugesagt wurde diesbezüglich einen anruf zu erhalten .
negative	nie wieder flugladen . de .
negative	the sales_person gave_me bad advice by telling_me i would be_happier with 00 ' tires instead of 00 '_s .
negative	when i told_him i wasn_'_t happy wit the 00 '_s and asked_him to exchange them , he said he couldn_'_t help me .
negative	i have purchased many parts from you guys and am " very " disappointed that when offered a $ 0 coupon to be emailed to me on next purchase if i would do a 00 word review , that only after i went to the effort to submit one and you accepted it , did you inform_me that my purchase wasn_'_t over $_000 .
negative	that '_s a blatant misrepresentation .
negative	you guys need to get your act_together .
negative	i expected better of you .
negative	we are unable to login in to the site or to re register and therefore were unable to place an order and had to shop elsewhere
negative	recently i rented a car for 00 days at dublin_airport from budget cars through nova car_hire ( booking number bie000000000 ) and will never be using nova car_hire again .
negative	on arrival at the budget cars ' desk in dublin_airport , i was informed that the so - called comprehensive insurance , which nova car_hire provides through a third_party , has several exceptions – notably : 0 .
negative	i was not covered should an accident be my fault .
negative	0 .
negative	should anything happen while the car was parked in a hotel car_park , i was not covered unless i was actually in the car .
negative	i paid an extra comprehensive insurance to budget cars , so that i did not risk paying up to 0000 euros should anything happen to the car during the rental period .
negative	i am most certainly not satisfied with nova car_hire and will never be using nova car_hire again .
negative	furthermore - writing a review on nova care hire '_s own review page ( link provided kindly by nova car_hire in a follow - up mail ) proved impossible , as the page redirects to a blank page within_seconds of entering the site .
negative	sincerely ,
negative	john buckley mcquaid
negative	i wanted a refund on a pre_- order since my key may arrive 0 days late .
negative	i contacted them initially at 00am and didn_'_t hear_anything back for about 00_hours .
negative	i confirmed that i wanted a refund about 0 minutes after i was contacted and then the agent helping_me did not reply .
negative	it '_s been 00_hours since then and i '_ve yet to hear_anything back .
negative	if everything goes well then the website is fine , but you have any troubles , or god_forbid , want your money back , don_'_t bother .
negative	i would not recommend partsgeek to anyone .
negative	i would have liked to speak to a live_person , then maybe i would not have ordered the wrong part .
negative	when i discovered my mistake , the only way i could get in touch with them was via_email and then they did not respond in time to cancel the order .
negative	i got an 000 number from my credit_card company , but could not get through .
negative	it rang and then they put you on hold via automation and then they hang_up on you .
negative	i will not order from them again !!
negative	!
negative	item came broke because it was packed in an oversize box without_any packing_material !!
negative	now i have to pay to ship it back without refunding the shipping cost !!
negative	are you kidding me !!?
negative	will never buy from them again unless they make it right !
negative	!
negative	this site looks very suspicious .
negative	reistered very protected and created in 0000 april .
negative	not sure how many have made purchases so_far .
negative	it say '_s its in florida , but no phone_number provided .
negative	the actual adress is in malaysia i believe .
negative	can not trust unless they ave phone_number and a proper email addres to contact .
negative	het is een lang verhaal ; maar in het kort :
negative	- 0 shirts besteld , zaten niet goed ; dus terug sturen
negative	- wou graag 0 shirt er voor retour , en de rest van_het bedrag teruggestort
negative	- na_een dikke week , nog geen shirt binnen
negative	- bellen naar klantenservice : " nee , je had niet moeten ruilen maar beide artikelen retour moeten sturen , zodat we het hele bedrag konden overmaken en_dat_je dan een nieuwe bestelling plaatst "
negative	- na mijn argument over dat_het bedrag van_mijn nieuwe bestelling ( ruiling ) niet verrekend kon worden met het totaalbedrag reageerde men : " ja , maar vorige week was mijn collega niet aanwezig , waardoor er communicatieproblemen waren opgetreden ".
negative	al met al : gevraagd of mijn geld terug kan worden gestort en nooit meer zaken er mee doen !
negative	overigens : levering ging prima .
negative	dit verhaal betreft alleen hun after - sale service .
negative	the staff was very rude and un patient .
negative	i call the staff , asking for category j , get told it isn_'_t available .
negative	but the web_site print out shows the cabint was confrimed .
negative	but the site shows it is available , so i booked at the site , and get the confirmation sheet , shows :" great news , your requested cabin is available -- and it is definitely yours if you pay your deposit before the hold expires ."
negative	but your staff mattew call me with bad attitaue .
negative	................. if the confirmation shows :" diffinitely yours " why cannt be yours .... all the phone conversations is not nice .
negative	very rude , not helpful .
negative	the staff name is matthew .
negative	very bad .
negative	i booked for about 0 cabin , total pay about $_00 , 000 --$ 00 , 000 ,
negative	i wish i didn_'_t contact your staff .
negative	order was cancelled and never contacted about it .
negative	sent a message to customer service and they have not contacted me .
negative	called and sat on hold then the automatic operator came on and stated call volumn was high and suggested going to the website and submitting a ticket .
negative	then hung_up on me .
negative	cant ever get to talk to anyone
negative	your picture of the lillie fountian looked great on your site but it as been a big disapointment we will not be uesing your site agian ihave put it in the pond so i cannot return it i surpose .
negative	it is not value for the money
negative	i booked 0 days ago , half way through the representative said that the rate changed and he needed to start over .
negative	upon going through the whole reservation again he realized he was booking for 0 to 0 may instead of the 0 to 0 april that i needed .
negative	i received 0 email cancellations so i am calling today to see if i actually have a reservation for the correct days of 0 to 0 april .
negative	meanwhile i have been billed_twice on my credit_card .
negative	by the way i am typing this as i am still on hold !!!!!!
negative	i will probably never , never use this service again even if someone eventually answers this simple call to tell me whether or not i have a reservation ..............
negative	still_waiting and not overly thrilled !!!
negative	!
negative	liebe ( mit ) leidenden ,
negative	auch meine freundin und_ich waren auf_der suche nach schönen esszimmerstühlen , und sind auch bei ambientedirect . com fündig geworden ; trotz der teilweise ( abgrundtief ) schlechten kritik , haben_wir dennoch über das online - portal der firma bestellt .
negative	nun , ich_bin keiner , der alles sofort für_die sprichwörtliche " bare münze " nimmt und mache mir gerne selbst ein bild - man mag ja doch immer gerne an das gute glauben .
negative	doch : auch wir wurden eines besseren belehrt .
negative	wir warten nunmehr seit zwei monaten auf unsere stühle , die - wohlgemerkt - ursprünglich mit_einer lieferzeit von zwei wochen angepriesen wurden .
negative	zwischenzeitlich gab es zwar eine unpersönlich e_-_mail , in der wir darüber informiert wurden , dass es bei_der lieferzeit doch zu erheblichen verzögerungen kommen sollte , gleichzeitig jedoch ein liefertermin für anfang mai in aussicht gestellt wurde .
negative	aber bisher ist noch rein gar nichts geschehen !
negative	auch auf mittlerweile drei e_-_mails und vier anrufe unsererseits wurde nicht reagiert .
negative	na ja , es_ist ja dem anschein nach auch nicht_mehr so wichtig , nachdem der kaufbetrag mit_einer pünktlichkeit von unserem konto abgebucht wurde , dass es selbst der schweizer bundesbahn die schamesröte ins gesicht treiben würde .
negative	ob auch wir unsere stühle jemals geliefert bekommen , ist mittlerweile zu bezweifeln und_das geld wird ggfs auch " futsch " sein .
negative	aber dennoch , liebes ambientedirect - team : wir würden uns auch jetzt noch sehr über ein lebenszeichen eurerseits freuen !!!!
negative	die prämisse " der kunde ist könig " gilt auch im online - zeitalter .
negative	daher auch unser fazit : lieber gleich bei einem anderen anbieter kaufen - auch wenn es zunächst den anschein macht , etwas teurer zu sein .
negative	three_weeks still have not gotten my order , they run you around and never answer the phone . i was told i would personally be contacted , what a joke . poor customer service or should i say " no customer service "
negative	would not use or recommend to anyone .
negative	ordered a a /_c condenser for my 000zx web_site states 0 in stock get a email_stating no stock available .
negative	checked web_site 0 days_later still states 0 in stock .
negative	ordered 0 items on 00 / 00 / 00 for christmas expecting that would be plenty of time , obviously not , still not received these - no communication from gadget_grotto to advise what is happening , despite the money being taken immediately out of my account .
negative	these were christmas_presents that have obviously not been given , which defeats the point of buying these .
negative	i ordered a part with a wrong_address , but did not know the address was wrong at first .
negative	after about two_weeks of waiting for my package , i called ups .
negative	ups told me that another person had received it and had contacted them back and they were getting it day of .
negative	told me it would be there next_day at my home .
negative	well , the next_day i go to ups in person and find out that the seller had requested the part back , even_though i had not been refunded the money and the part was still mine .
negative	not their call to make .
negative	i would have had the package about a week_ago if not for them asking for it back .
negative	they generate generic e_-_mail responses for me , showing they do not read my e_-_mails !!!!
negative	i get the same e_-_mails twice , with no change at all in them .
negative	i even got one that told me how to send the package back , and they have the package !!
negative	i can '_t get through on the phone at all , after three tries already near the beginning of the business day , three different days !@!!
negative	they seem to be the only supplier of my car part , and i have to wait up to 00 days just to get my money back , and i don_'_t even know if they will admit they have the part , except to ups !!
negative	totally put off by the company '_s claim to great customer service !!!
negative	a total farce !!
negative	but where else can i go , get my drift ?
negative	they have monopolized this car part .
negative	i have not yet received notification of the book being sent .
negative	i paid_extra so i would have it for a meeting today .
negative	not real pleased .
negative	having received an e_mail advertising a new flavour chocolate peanut_butter , i was tempted and ordered / purchased a 0kg_tub , upon_receipt i immediately made up a shake , and placed in fridge to chill , approx 00mins later i removed to drink , it was then that reality hit me and i realised why i had stopped using bodybuilding_warehouse protien and bought other brands , why ?
negative	my newly made shake had solidified and was more mouse than liquid , it was impossible to drink .
negative	the next_day i made my usual oats breakfast , making the oats with 000ml of water , then when done adding 0 scoops of protien powder , again same problem , the moist oats was now a solid dry mass , i had to add a further 000ml to make it edible .
negative	however a simple solution was immediately at hand , i began using other brands , which do not thicken .
negative	totally_unacceptable bodybuilding_warehouse .
negative	i would be interested to hear your erxplanation of the thickening , and also what ingredient you use that causes this , that other brands obviously dont .
negative	.
negative	last_week my recent order was delivered , part of the order was wrong , i telephoned 0 seperate times waiting on hold in total over 00_mins .
negative	i then complained via their " contact us " procedure , after 0 days this had not been answered so complained again , again 0 days_later , 0 further phone_calls on hols and still no response , all because my protien delivered the wrong item .
negative	not acceptable .
negative	attention ne faite pas comme moi !
negative	acheter vos billet chez govoyage moin chere et plus claire que ebookers , l ' offre cadeau ( save 00 00 00 etc_.)
negative	est uniquement réservé au vol combiné ...( vol plus voiture , vol plus hotel etc_.)
negative	kind of hard to review an item that i haven_'_t received .
negative	the will randomly lock your money up and refuse to be very clear about when you '_ll get it back .
negative	if you are depending_on that money for something , don_'_t let paypal near it .
negative	i bought fuel_injectors and got a great price .
negative	however they placed a deposit on my account or " core_charge " going by their lingo .
negative	so to send them my old fuel filters i have to call parts_geek and wait on hold_forever for an " rma " number to send them back .
negative	i can '_t even get through to anyone over the phone there .
negative	tried sending an_email but that takes 00 - 00_hrs to hear back .
negative	why couldnt you just send a return_label and an_rma_number for my old parts with my order ?
negative	why do you have to waste my time like this ?
negative	i '_ll probably have to pay the postage too for this .
negative	what a pain in the a $$.
negative	dmv has better customer service .
negative	liars and cheats , they take your money sell you additional insurance then damage your goods and then use a list of reasons_why its your fault and won_'_t pay you for the damage , dont use them !!
negative	!
negative	i purchased a ticket back in november_0000 and cancelled that ticket on the website a day prior to the departure date .
negative	i was sent an_email by expedia saying i have a credit of $_000 and 0 year to use that credit .
negative	now , december_00th i am trying to use that credit and keep getting a run around by the company saying that i didn_'_t specify a new departure date and that the ticket is unrefundable !!!!
negative	i paid insurance on this ticket because i cancelled a previous ticket 0_weeks prior to this one due to work commitments .
negative	i have used this website for years for the cheap tickets , but cheap tickets come at a huge loss ..
negative	i called last night , spend a good hour on and off hold times , having to wait for their supervisor to get back to them and more wait time .
negative	this company doesn_'_t even have operators answering from the usa .
negative	they outsourced to other_countries to save_money .
negative	which is why customer service sucks so much ..
negative	i will never use this company ever again .
negative	currently i am still_waiting to see if they will honor my credit after calling for the second strait day with no call back or email from them !
negative	!
negative	i ordered 0 gift_cards .
negative	0 of these orders had the wrong zip_code .
negative	i called back 0 - 0 hours_later to change to correct zips .
negative	was told it could not because orders were processed and i had to pay a cancellation_fee for each and resubmit these orders .
negative	doesn_'_t your firm have a change address form for customer service ?
negative	so i gave agent the 0 confirmation numbers to cancel .
negative	instead of cancelling these orders , she cancelled the 0rd order which had the correct address .
negative	this agent needs to be better educated or learn to understand english .
negative	i will not use your firm to order in the future .
negative	i ordered my parts and checked out .
negative	got an_email the next_day that my order was on hold because my billing and home address didn_'_t match .
negative	i then called my credit_card company and got it straight .
negative	i contacted parts_geek to verify with my bank like they asked .
negative	never got a response back from them .
negative	they sent me another email_stating that they attempted to call me several_times , which was a lie .
negative	they only attempted once and i missed the call .
negative	i attempted to call the number back and got a message that said that they don_'_t accept incoming_calls .
negative	now almost a week is going but and made zero contact with them .
negative	so i sent another email and told them to keep the parts and ill just buy locally and contacted my card company to not charge me .
negative	worst service i could not receive .
negative	if i could give them negative stars i most certainly would have .
negative	i ordered 0 parts , one was wrong , the other was faulty .
negative	return_policy rediculous
negative	i ordered a gift_card for our daughter on may 00rd her_birthday .
negative	they couldn_'_t send it right_away for whatever_reason .
negative	then e_-_mail was received approximately 0 days_later saying it had been sent .
negative	however it wasn_'_t in her e_-_mail .
negative	i contacted gift_cards and was told they were having issues with their system and they sent it again and again and again .
negative	i asked for a refund and was told i couldn_'_t get one on an e_- credit_card .
negative	i was at my wits_end .
negative	i called gift_card one more time .
negative	this time i contacted a customer service representative by the name of [_name ].
negative	i explained the situation and the fact i was told i could not get a refund .
negative	she advised it was not true and asked if they could attempt to send it one more time .
negative	i explained i would rather have the refund .
negative	she processed it and i should receive it shortly .
negative	if it wasn_'_t for [_name ] this company would have gotten no stars .
negative	she was polite , professional and prompt in taking_care of my issue .
negative	thanks again [_name ]......
negative	i bought the product last monday and when i log in on my account to see the status , it says " processing ".
negative	0 days to process a purchase ?
negative	my product didnt even ship to me !
negative	?
negative	im trying to contact the company by email but i have no answer , i '_ve sent 0 emails already !
negative	i want information about my order : 000000000 .
negative	the non gambling one does not make use of buying things online it would be nice to list of these online stores that take ukash !!
negative	not only that it was already used .
negative	don_'_t order anything from this company .
negative	my advice is if you want to order on line
negative	call the company first !
negative	if they don_'_t answer the phone with a live_person move on !
negative	i learned the hard way .
negative	any company that wants your business will gladly talk to you !
negative	just my 0 cents !
negative	parts geak return center is back on the east_coast but was ship to from california the shipping to the return address for the 0 rotor cost $_00 . 00 each $_000 . 00 for both ups_ground watch out for ther packing sucks and your responsible for the item packing be returned in resale condition i would attach a photo but i can '_t never do_business with this company
negative	this company pops_up as one of the first options for booking and make it look like they are the hotel .
negative	i made this mistake once and was left without a room and o support from the company at all whatso ever .
negative	now i made a second booking and wanted to cancel but was already charged and informed that no changes could be made .
negative	be_careful using this company , or better yet , stear way clear of this company .
negative	you get no financial break and only hardship .
negative	book direct or if you want to go with a cheap company where you don_'_t get the option to make_changes go to priceline . com , at_least there you get a better price .
negative	i recently ordered parts for my car there was an issue with my billing_address that was apparently to hard for them to fix in a timely_manor i stated that if the the issue wasn_'_t resolved quickly i would cancel my order they replied_saying because of my lack of communication they were forced to cancel my order also it wasn_'_t until they canceled my order that they gave_me a contact number instead of a single email per day i will not be ordering again i will do_business else where
negative	i ordered overnight shipping on everything .
negative	they shipped ground instead but kept the extra money i had paid .
negative	you can '_t complain , you can '_t contact anyone to sort it out .
negative	they are faceless .
negative	i had to leave the country before my stuff arrived so now i have paid for the product , the extra shipping and i have nothing .
negative	store only had selected jacket in small sizes , so had to order large off the internet .
negative	unfortunately it still didn_'_t fit .
negative	i tried to take it back to store where somebody had previously confirmed we could get a full_refund only to find that we had to return by post unless we wanted store credit .
negative	it cost me £ 0 to send recorded .
negative	never again !
negative	i have been ripped clean by this company .
negative	no communication after asking for a refund .
negative	near on $_00 lost for 0000 points that they refused to deliver .
negative	i asked for a refund and got no response .
negative	they took the money on the 0st of may 0000 now it is the 00th of may 0000 and no response has_been received .
negative	good luck to anyone silly enough to use this site .
negative	they are clearly just_plain old thieves .
negative	just imagine what they are doing with the photo ids they are requesting that people send to them .
negative	recipe for disaster .
negative	highly avoid .
negative	use [_external reference removed_] instead , they are cheaper and the service is excellent .
negative	junk email was checked all the obvious stuff .
negative	beware of this fraudulent site .
negative	order number was submitted as part of the review process here .
negative	why would you ask for that which you already know ugk ?
negative	nothing else to say , besides i will not return my business .
negative	i placed an order which stated my card was declined .
negative	i filled_out an e_-_mail ticket which was never responded to .
negative	there was never a problem with my card .
negative	i even re ordered it and the same thing .
negative	i wasted my time trying to contact parts_geek but nobody_answers the phone no matter what number you push .
negative	you can only fill_out one e_-_mail ticket .
negative	its funny i get this survey because my order was never completed . by_far this is the worst company i have ever tried to do_business with .
negative	there is no customer service or maybe they were on vacation .
negative	i looked on the better business web_site and ther is so many complaints i '_m glad i didn_'_t do_business with you .
negative	thank_you for wasting my time .
negative	i bought a lock set , paying it 00 , few hours after it cost 00 ( i have evidence of all , it '_s not a fake ).
negative	that '_s all , be carfeul , they make unkind variations of price , visit twice the page , or the day after , make comparisons and you '_ll see it , don_'_t buy here , they double prices ( if you ' re lucky ) and don_'_t refund you .
negative	( the don_'_t refund anything , in fact i had no money refunded , they denied it because i opened a paypal procedure )
negative	first of all , i am sure that brilliance . com has some excellent diamonds for reasonable prices , however make_sure the the ring you get is absolutely one you '_ll love ( which is hard because you can '_t actually see it until you get it ) they have the worst returns service i have ever_dealt_with .
negative	it says on their website that returns take 0 - 0 business days to process .. ha !
negative	they '_ve had my return for over a month now and i have yet to receive my return !
negative	i have called the customer service department over 0 times and have been blatantly lied to over four times !
negative	( on one occasion they told me i had called them on their long_distance line and they needed to call me back ..
negative	they took my number down , but surprise , no call !
negative	honestly , a long_distance line ??)..
negative	i am seriously contemplating getting a lawyer because this company seems very shady to me .
negative	also it took three_weeks to even get the ring !!!
negative	i '_m not someone that complains either ..
negative	this is the first poor review i '_ve ever written .
negative	buyer_beware !!!!
negative	i don_'_t trust these_people !
negative	!
negative	if i ordered a part and found out it was wrong and then look at my end of oh i ordered the part and saw no wrong doing on my end then i try to contact the place i ordered the part and they send an_email back as if it is a computer talking to me and they do not even ask what is wrong with it it just says to return it and for me to pay the shipping back .
negative	also if i ship it wrong or do not send it back right i will not recieve a refund .
negative	i don_'_t mind_paying the shipping if i was wrong but i was not i am pretty sure and i still neede the part but no one contacted me trying to help me fix the problem .
negative	this website sucks .
negative	do not use it .
negative	i rate their customer service at zero out of ten in fact i don_'_t think they have one i never_heard a copy say leave a message and will get back to you in a week their product came shipped very poorly .
negative	i ordered the same part from another company it arrive one day earlier and it was packaged very better_than parts_geek and when i called the company they picked_up the phone right_away with parts_geek you don_'_t talk to anyone never to this day i never spoke to anyone from parts_geek it '_s all been emails they suck !
negative	so i buy all of my parts form ( jcwhitney ) believe me i am a hard - working american that deserves more out of a company i purchased from and i do not work for any parts company just a regular consumer that had such a bad_experience with parts_geek if you don_'_t want have a headache or feel_like you got robbed dont go on the web_site .
negative	u see i don_'_t have experience with car parts and i need to talk to someone about the parts i was purchasing and there was no one there to talk to just emails that they don_'_t get back to you till a week_later then when you get the wrong part they charger 00_% restocking_fee and charge it for the shipping it back i feel_like i got rob thanks partsgeek
negative	as i type this , i am on the phone with their incompetent customer service department , and have been for 0 hours and counting .
negative	after trying to book a vacation package with them i was told that they pre_- authorized the 0 credit_cards that i wanted to book with .
negative	( one was a visa_debit ).
negative	i didn ; t end up booking the package and decided to book the next_day .
negative	i called back the next_day and tried to book again .
negative	i was told i couldn_'_t because i would have to wait 00_hours for the first pre_- authorized amount cleared .
negative	obviously they don_'_t understand how travel prices fluctuate .
neutral	i ordered four items , two we ' re received to the correct address however the second two items were addressed to 0 cross park not 0 lympstone court .
neutral	my neighbour kindly brought the incorrectly addressed parcel to me
neutral	the company has awesome prices and a wide_variety of selections .
neutral	they also have the availability of many free_samples which is great when wanting to try new products .
neutral	however , the down_side of that is , the shipping is outrageous !
neutral	i wish they would offer a reasonable flat_rate shipping within the continental usa like many of the other_companies do .
neutral	they offer a 0 % price match which is great .
neutral	i am pleased with their selection and prices , just not the high shipping .
neutral	i placed a order for 00 dollars and some odd cents , after shipping was added it totaled out at 00 dollars and some odd cents .
neutral	the parts weren_'_t exactly_what i ordered .
neutral	i had to return one of them .
neutral	i wasn_'_t given it any pick_up numbers to return with .
neutral	i bought a switch from this site .
neutral	got the part in a few_days , quicker_than_expected .
neutral	but the part i got was chinese made junk and not oem or even close .
neutral	guess you need to check the manufacturer before you order ...
neutral	could not get out of free shipping pop_up without clicking out of parts_geek site so ended_up getting 0 pump then supposedly have to pay restocking_charge also ortherwise was very easy to find great selection of parts .
neutral	they may have what you need but be_careful the shipping is expensive .
neutral	very good price on the product but shipping cost seems about double of a reasonable rate .
neutral	i had big problem to print my bording card because you emailadress eas spekt with høyrup the ø eas the problem i called assistance an have pates 0 € bit got no help .
neutral	top bad
neutral	i droped my truck off at the local dealer there installing the correct colored bumper_cover . thanx for your efforts , dont need to return the one i got from you , thanx for asking , gave it to my pits for a chew toy .
neutral	the fact that they had the pi and shipped out so fast is great .
neutral	price was good and shipping time was good .
neutral	what really irked me is that i needed an extra hdmi_cable , i ordered one and it never told me it was out of stock .
neutral	i did not know this until the package came and the contents list showed backlogged .
neutral	i then had to drive to the store and pick one up so i could hook it all up .
neutral	i would have never ordered the cable if i had known .
neutral	i '_m normally pretty satisfied with priceline , but on several_occasions they made mistakes on the star levels and we were given inaccurate , unfairly listed hotels ; i called and brought it to their attention , but their outsourced call_center representatives had no interest in making it right .
neutral	i still use priceline , but they '_ve lost about 00_% of my business to competitors .
neutral	it '_s cheaper to keep your existing clients satisfied then it is to bring in new ones .
neutral	my order was shipped promptly and was received in excellent condition ; however , the shipping speed itself took close to 00 business days ( 0_weeks ) to arrive !
neutral	they use this super cheap shipping which took_forever !
neutral	i ordered from bookbyte directly but i don_'_t know if this effects how fast / slow shipping takes or what shipping company / product they use ; in summary : book was a good price and in better_than_expected condition ; overall satisfied but be warned : when they say " 0 - 00 business days " they took the full two_weeks !
neutral	i had a good start with the order .
neutral	the system accepted the input and i paid using the system online .
neutral	i then received an_email_saying that there were not enough items to satisfy my order for 0 deodorant sprays .
neutral	i was asked if i wanted a refund or if i wanted to wait a week .
neutral	i chose the latter and expected to receive 0 items .
neutral	you will be aware that i only received 0 items but the postage was the same as if 0 would have been sent so i was only refunded for the two items .
neutral	had i know this was going to happen i would have cancelled the order as the cost per item was dramatically increased by the postage charges .
neutral	i would be very happy to receive a refund on the postage as in my view the goods should not have been shipped until i was made aware of the change in the number being sent .
neutral	mike lofthouse
neutral	i love b_&_h , but on this purchase they had zero knowledge of the item which was several_hundred_dollars .
neutral	i had to go elsewhere for the info , and then return to their site to make the purchase ( they do have good prices ).
neutral	my advise would be to have someone_who_knows the item around don_'_t just make things up or tell the customer to call the manufacturer .
neutral	we arrived in munich and went to pick_up our car , however when i asked about the gps the manager came over and said they wouldn_'_t rent me a gps because i wasn_'_t dropping_off the car at the same location .
neutral	she told me they don_'_t get them back from the other locations , so i had to find a store and purchase a gps locally .
neutral	fun !
neutral	no map , no directions , no_idea where or who sells a gps .
neutral	spent the 0st day of my vacation trying to find the above list .
neutral	i had all my tires balanced and the truck aligned .
neutral	the staff at the store were very courteous and professional .
neutral	they took my vehicle in right_away , and finish the vehicle in the time frame they promised .
neutral	the problem is , while the vibration is better in my truck .
neutral	it is still not gone .
neutral	good service but very hard to contact costumer service
neutral	the tiny part for my shower could have been placed in a small envelope and cost no more than a 0nd_class stamp .
neutral	instead , i was charged £ 0 . 00 for standard postage .
neutral	ordered online for a home fitting between 0000 and 0000 .
neutral	was told i would get a phone_call half_hour before fitter arrived .
neutral	fitter_turned_up at 0pm with no phone_call , good job i hadn_'_t gone out .
neutral	had a general conversation and asked if he had a busy day to which he replied no it had been pretty quiet .
neutral	begs the question why i had to spend the whole day waiting for my two tyres to be fitted ??
neutral	however the fitting was in the time scale quoted and service provided was good .
neutral	just a shame a whole day has to be wasted .
neutral	overall the service was good except that you cost yourself time and potentially alot of money .
neutral	i ordered 0ea kyb shock struts for a chevy cobalt , they were shipped individually and arrived the same day , i also ordered 0ea kyb rear_shock_absorbers for the same car at the same time , these were packaged together and shipped at the same time as the struts , if you look in to their tracking history they made five more stops than the other packages made , that might be an issue between you and your vendor or shipping dept .
neutral	i thought it was a good deal until i got to germany .
neutral	the rental company could not locate my reservation and once they did i had trouble receiving the free upgrade i was promised on the phone .
neutral	while the price was lower_than most other car_rental services , it ws very frustrating to have to go through all of the aggrevation to get my vehicle after a 00 hour flight .
neutral	the car i finally got was very nice and was good on gas .
neutral	i received 0 of my parts fast the other part i ordered almost took 0_weeks to arrive which is kind of ridiculous they should show the location of the warehouse so you know what to .
neutral	expect when ordering i wouldve ordered a different part if i received it quicker
neutral	very pleasant company , nice to deal with but no show as of now with the goods --- probably the post_office / royal_mail / parcelforce
neutral	the discounts are great , but the user_interface is not up to seamless standard .
neutral	without discount i wouldn_'_t use delivery .
neutral	it took entirely to long for delivery .
neutral	maybe a lot of people don_'_t know about this ...
neutral	but when you book on - line with hostelworld , the 00_% you pay in advance goes directly to hostelworld .
neutral	the property gets 0 % of this 00 %.
neutral	therefore i don_'_t understand what is the service fee for !
neutral	apart of the 00_% they charge 0 . 0 € for every booking you make ...
neutral	when it '_s possible , i try to book on hostelbookers , since they don_'_t charge this ( nonsense ) fee .
neutral	too exspensive , had to pay 00 pounds more than my brother who used ryanair site ;|
neutral	customer service is not good at communicating with dealers .
neutral	automated follow ups are not followed_up on by a rep .
neutral	it is difficult to get answers , which is frustrating when our clients want them too .
neutral	now i see a couple of product lines are being discontinued .... if i didn_'_t follow the manufacturer '_s site , i would not have known , and i already quoted that line .
neutral	service sending product is great , but more attention needs to be paid to communicating with dealers .
neutral	väntade tio dagar innan jag_fick informationen om att klockan jag beställt var_på väg från leverantör .
neutral	hade jag vetat att tagit så lång tid så hade jag köpt en anna klocka som möjligen kommit snabbare .
neutral	i received my package in a reasonable_amount of time and the package itself was reasonably packed well given the contents .
neutral	my only_complaint was that there was a three inch year on the plastic of the wheel well fender i had ordered and apparently someone had stapled the tear with two staples to remedy the situation .
neutral	since i have ordered this product previously before i know that staples are not a normal part of this item .
neutral	i needed the part installed now and was not willing to wait for a replacement , so clearly i made the best of the situation with returning the item .
neutral	since this was the first discrepancy i have had with parts_geek i will still purchase from them again as long as i don_'_t have any more orders like this one .
neutral	we run a b_& b in the usa - and i just received an_email from 0flats that they have published our reservation calendar online and their custmers can book rooms with us .
neutral	since the company did not contact us before listing our property we were negatively impressed with their business eithics .
neutral	we have requested that they remove the unauthorized listing and they have complied .
neutral	i always order from tigerfitness . com .
neutral	i saw that supplement_warehouse had a sale on my favorite protein for a real good price .
neutral	i usually spend about $_000 - 000 every 0 months or so so i figured i would just open an account at sw and get my order there .
neutral	i placed the order in a sunday .
neutral	it says it hasn_'_t shipped yet on tuesday so i called .
neutral	" it will ship today sir " okay so wed goes by and i check around lunch time on thursday .
neutral	" oh i '_m very sorry it will ship today to get there saterday ".
neutral	fri i get a phone_call , it '_s sw letting my know my order has shipped today and will get there monday !
neutral	i will say te lady was very nice and assured me they emailed me some great coupons and give me a lot of free_samples .
neutral	meanwhile j ran_out of protein and wondered_why the hell i ever left tigerfitness . com ?
neutral	it was an easy process but for the item i wanted there was no sizing information telling_me what s , m , l actually meant .
neutral	i was advised that xs would be ok for my daughter but when the item came it was way too big .
neutral	great products once here but asked me to confirm order multiple_times , rang up customer_services to check and they said it had been sent but had to re confirm
neutral	found your site ane was real happy to see you had most of what i need now , plus , what i may want to purchase in the future for maint .
neutral	purposes .
neutral	however , when questions arise , i prefer to be able to contact companies by phone .
neutral	you company is not customer friendly and i would like to see that improved .
neutral	i '_m sure i '_m not the only one who feels this way .
neutral	it may behoove you to improve this part of your business .
neutral	not everyone wants to constantly use computers & emailing for everything .
neutral	thanks for your attention .
neutral	great that you do want to keep in touch with customers and get their feed_back .
neutral	now let '_s see if you " act upon it ".
neutral	i reviewed all the suppliers of electric bike kits .
neutral	i found distinct advantage with the clean republic product , mainly the switch which relieved me of putting cutout switches on my brakes leavers .
neutral	i had a sla battery on the first kit i bought and ran it for over a year on a hard tail rockhopper with a front shock , it worked great .
neutral	so good i decided to get a full suspension bike and buy another kit and 0 lithium batteries .
neutral	i first replaced the old sla on the rockhopper then put_together the full suspension .
neutral	i didn_'_t make it around the block before the torq of the motor broke the dropout on the fork .
neutral	i called cr to ask about problems like this happening to others .
neutral	the guy i spoke with seemed to know the history of different problems that can happen in putting these on different_types of bikes .
neutral	he said he was not aware of anyone having the same problem , so i ordered a $_000 fork planning to put the motor back on the full suspension bike .
neutral	the next week the fork on the rockhopper broke the same way .
neutral	my plan won_'_t work so i got a steel fork for the rockhopper and put the other kit on my cruser bike .
neutral	i love the simple and efficient kits , i only wish they had a torq stabilizer arm so i can use the kits on alloy forks .
neutral	i have allways been happy with my purchases from swiss_outpost and many have been substantial but this last order nhas been some trouble .
neutral	i ordered two bands for two of my swiss watches and only received one .
neutral	was charged for two but no_indication of what is going on with the other item .
neutral	i received my replacement side_view_mirror on the day they told me i would .
neutral	it fit great .
neutral	my only_complaint was the packaging it was sent in .
neutral	the mirror ( inside a non_- padded box ) was thrown in another box three_times its size with no padding , bubble_wrap or peanuts , so it just rattled its way across country .
neutral	by the time it got to oregon the outer_box was half open .
neutral	i couldn_'_t believe the mirror didn_'_t break on the way .
neutral	tip .
neutral	using the us_postal service may be cheaper to ship your product , it does not help your customer . the package travels to different sorting cities .
neutral	in the automotive world speed is desirable .
neutral	far too many emails .
neutral	products ok .
neutral	the regulator was great installation went great .
neutral	i did take_forever to get here .
neutral	i do not like the shipping where it goes so_far fedx and the rest usps i could have driven to fresno and picked it up in a day took 00 the it was sent .
neutral	i purchased these for crossfit and doing pull ups , toe to bars , etc and the grip ends up being too thick .
neutral	great idea but need to be thinner .
neutral	i love this service , very fast and convenient and even saved me a few dollars compared to the local_pet_stores .
neutral	the only_thing that upsets me is that both deliveries of my premium canned_dog_food came with several crushed cans , i assume from the delivery .
neutral	( although no damage was obvious on the box it was shipped in ) i will not feed my dogs_food from damaged cans , therefore there were cans of wasted food that offset the savings i thought i would be getting .
neutral	i '_m going to try it for one more shipment , if it continues i will stop using the service and get it at my local store .
neutral	bought some solar_lights from festive_lights arrived on time not one would work , had to get new batteries two won_'_t switch off until battery is flat but the other 0 are fine , would buy more if i thought the batteries would be ok and all worked_fine , they the torch stake lights .
neutral	this was probably the smallest hotel_room i ever stayed in .
neutral	we had a single room with a queen bed .
neutral	im_glad we were just there to sleep one night and leave .
neutral	but it was very very clean and had a newer feel to it .
neutral	it doesnt have a pool and breakfast was disappointing .
neutral	i love the item i bought .
neutral	however , i did have to wait nearly two_weeks to receive it .
neutral	my order went through , but didn_'_t get put on a picking schedule .
neutral	if i didn_'_t call them , i don_'_t think i would have ever got what i ordered .
neutral	i would go through it all again if i had to .
neutral	just a bit frustrating .
neutral	i ordered a basic wenger swiss_army watch .
neutral	i '_ve been wearing one for over 00 years .
neutral	it keeps perfect time and i '_ve only replaced the battery as needed .
neutral	decided to buy a spare .
neutral	my online order went fine , but the new watch was defective on arrival .
neutral	couldn_'_t properly set time or date .
neutral	my email sos to swiss_outpost received no reply for several days .
neutral	i phoned swiss_outpost and spoke with a courteous customer service rep .
neutral	he promised to send me a replacement watch with a prepaid mailer for me to return the defective initial purchase .
neutral	i received the new watch in a few_days and returned the defective .
neutral	so_far , the replacement is functioning well .
neutral	so , i '_m hopeful despite the inconvenience .
neutral	swiss_outpost needs to improve its email responses and wenger should up - grade its quality control .
neutral	i needed a difficult stainless_steel hardware item to find and they managed after a few_minutes of waiting on hold to dig one out for me which they had a while so discounted down .
neutral	my luck i guess .
neutral	they seemed fairly knowledgeable .
neutral	when you ' re traveling in eastern_europe with it '_s multiple languages a gps is a life saving necessity !
neutral	it '_s probably necessary anytime you ' re traveling in this day and age .
neutral	trying to read a map while you ' re driving is inviting danger , even if you ' re pulling over and stopping to do it .
neutral	roads other than highways are not well signed .
neutral	many streets do not have street signs .
neutral	all cars should come with gps !
neutral	to charge more than it costs to buy one is unfair , especially when they don " t work all the time !
neutral	ours kept cutting in and out , the voice was sometimes on and sometimes off and more than once , it took us to dead ends .
neutral	if you ' re going to rent them , at_least keep them current !
neutral	the car was fine and behaved well , but oh , that gps !
neutral	i chose two products that were cheaper_than other_sites .
neutral	only_complaint was that i had asked for it to be delivered at work not my home address and this did not happen .
neutral	i had reserved the car from canada two months before i was to pick it up .
neutral	then i called the rental office in salisbury three_weeks prior to pickup to say i would be a day late in getting it .
neutral	they said no problem .
neutral	when i got there , i was seen as a no show from the previous day , hence , not the car i wanted at all .
neutral	instead of a peugeot_000 diesel , i got a vauxhaul corsa , 0 . 0 litre petrol , which had a hard time keeping up to speed on motorways or going up hills .
neutral	i have rented with them three_times before at the same location , and always had excellent service - this was a disappointment .
neutral	i am very happy about my three recent_purchases .
neutral	the only_negative is that one of my canvas has 0 apparent wrinkles .
neutral	i haven_'_t tried to get the wrinkles out by tightening the canvas .
neutral	also , i didn_'_t try sending the canvas back , because i farm all day long - it '_s hard to be at my townhouse when ups makes their deliveries .
neutral	i bought a selection of flavors and strengths .
neutral	the 0rd capsule i used got stuck in my u machine .
neutral	had to unplug and dig it out from the bottom because the sliding top wouldnt open .
neutral	i thought i broke my new u but after 0 tries of running just water thru , the mechanism reset so it works again .
neutral	i have about 00 pods left and if another gets stuck they are all going back .
neutral	there '_s a small manufacturing difference from nespresso .
neutral	as for the espresso it '_s ok but nespresso just tastes better , more like what you get in a cafe .
neutral	we ordered a dometic rm0000wimss with ice on door .
neutral	your invoice said rm0000wimss .
neutral	but when refrig arrived it was model rm0000imss without the ice on the door .
neutral	after_contacting you , i felt that you did everything you could to rectify the problem .
neutral	but we were in dire need of a new refrig and decided to keep the model shipped .
neutral	we were credited for the lower price .
neutral	all other aspects of the service you provided was excellent .
neutral	ordered a box of greenie '_s for my little maltese .
neutral	shipping took about 0 days and went fedex to usps .
neutral	when i opened the carton the greenie '_s box was with a christmas overrap .
neutral	being that i purchased and received the item in june it did not make me happy to see that as i would believe the item was sitting on a shelf in a warehouse at_least 0 - 0 months .
neutral	at the rate i give the item to my dog the 00 count box will be done at the same time of the date on the bottom of the box .
neutral	i like partsgeek as far as parts availability and price .
neutral	the problem is , on the rare_occasion that you absolutely have to ask a question , it is impossible to reach anyone .
neutral	they never , ever pick_up the phone .
neutral	you simply sit on hold for ages , then the system disconnects you .
neutral	if you e_-_mail , you are lucky to get a response in a couple of days .
neutral	our contract stated that we would be met at the nelson airport , specified date and time .
neutral	we stood outside for 00_minutes before the car arrived .
neutral	during this time , a friendly security office allowed_us to call the contact number with his personal cell .
neutral	the office person said they did not have a flight number , so didn_'_t come as arranged .
neutral	it still took and hour after that to show up .
neutral	the agent was friendly and agreed to pick_up the car at our hotel , at 0 am on the return date .
neutral	when he wasn_'_t there , i called the office and they asked me who i picked_up the car from ?!
neutral	i said " how would i remember his_name ?"
neutral	she agreed that i would leave the keys at the hotel desk .
neutral	we had to go and i was a little uncomfortable w_/ o a face to face and car " check out ".
neutral	seems no additional_charges , but this was not the experience i expected .
neutral	i think your business model works and seems to be a great thermometer for businesses more so than the unscrupulous yelp .
neutral	when i received the email from trustpilot asking to review a recent partsgeek . com purchase i immediately ripped them a new one for selling me a wiper_blade that did not fit when their website claimed otherwise .
neutral	i gave them one star and wrote them off as a worthless online vendor .
neutral	my review was published .
neutral	then i took out the garbage and saw the shipping_label on the package .
neutral	it was from a different company .
neutral	my partsgeek order was actually a muffler assembly which was perfect , well priced and quickly shipped .
neutral	luckily , i had the opportunity to edit the review to the 0_stars that they deserved .
neutral	so here is why i am reviewing you : trust_pilot asked me to rate a transaction with a company but did not specify the purchase .
neutral	like millions of others , i purchase online almost daily and i made the mistake of mixing up the vendors with the purchase .
neutral	i smeared a company that did not deserve it .
neutral	i suggest that you guys name the product transaction in asking for reviews rather_than just the company .
neutral	this would increase accuracy .
neutral	steve m .
neutral	i really like the products & the in store staff_member was top_drawer ( no pun ) .
neutral	however , i was let_down a bit when half the order did not arrive , that being said , the problem was sorted promptly & courteously .
neutral	the dress i bought was really bad quialty but i wasn_'_t surprise for the cheap price
neutral	great stuff but couldnt find a single pair of trunks in medium_size so very disappointed otherwise a 0_star_rating would have been 0
neutral	the mirror came by ups to the post_office where i had to go pick it up aka hassle .
neutral	the mirror came on time , but it had minor chips in the glass not enough to make me return it but i would have liked for it to be perfect .
neutral	the service was good .
neutral	could have been better
neutral	good , but lost the battle to facebook because they started to copy it .
neutral	always have been happy with service and products until i had to wait on a refund for parts listed as in stock but were not .
neutral	has_been over 0 days and still no refund .
neutral	first email said 0 to 0 days then came second stating 0 - 0 days .
neutral	in the automotive business time is money and i had to order from another company to get the correct parts .
neutral	their parts have already arrived and im waiting on a refund still .
neutral	the product is good and cheaper but delivery time is sucks i order on a thursday took 0 days before i got in my hands i think yall need to look into faster delivery time .
neutral	i was happy to get my order so quickly .
neutral	unfortunately , i received 0 driver '_s side wipers rather_than the 0 driver and 0 passenger wiper i ordered .
neutral	the air_filter and the trunk shocks were correct .
neutral	lost an_hour going around the park .
neutral	i wanted to hop out at the top but the wife wasn_'_t tired yet and didn_'_t want to miss a thing .
neutral	after the park was fast and interesting but we were tired then .
neutral	wish the hotel clerk would have explained the different tours and how the double back at the park was going to happen .
neutral	the driver could have also warned us in time .
neutral	ottimi_prezzi ottimo_prodotto poco precisi x la_spedizione
neutral	good initial service and advice but after a few_days got a call to say my gift order was not ready which_meant it would not arrive in time .
neutral	however , they found a suitable_alternative and provided next_day delivery which put things right .
neutral	overall a relatively good experience and would give them a second chance to get it all right next time .
neutral	registration was simple , clear , concise instructions and confirmation was immediate .
neutral	cost was outrageous due to blue lake music festival -- supply & demand .
neutral	bestilte_en mobiltelefon som_blev_sendt dagen_efter bestillingen .
neutral	den ankom dog først yderligere 0 dage_senere .
neutral	fik først en sms om at pakken ville_blive leveret den_ene dag - for senere på_samme_dag at modtage en_ny sms - at pakken først ville_blive leveret en_dag senere .

neutral	lidt ærgerligt var_det dog , at emballagen på telefonen var beskadiget og ikke særlg pæn .
neutral	lidt ufedt at give en julegave , der ser ud som_om den har_været i krig .
neutral	love having new color ink but it would not shut_off my color light and i tried looking up to reset them and it still didn_'_t shut_off .
neutral	so ima be a little_iffy buying from inkfarm again .
neutral	asked for same day delivery but was not notified of an unsuccessful delivery until 0 days_later .
neutral	once a new delivery address was established , a new bunch of flowers were then delivered the next_day - a total of 0 days after we had requested same day delivery .
neutral	pleased with the service once we were alerted but 0 days is too_long to be notified of an unsuccessful delivery .
neutral	like most other people , the process was not without problems .
neutral	i made payment from skrill and received a strange message that they needed to validate me .
neutral	i could either call or wait for the review to conclude .
neutral	i waited 00 days and contacted them .
neutral	i was immediately told that they needed a photo of the front and back of the card ( with the numbers obscured ).
neutral	i challenged if this was really necessary and they responded ( reasonably ) that the billing_address was in the us and my ip was in finland .
neutral	i send over images ( actually pretty poor quality ) and with in 00_minutes i received validation from t - mobile that the full credit was on my account .
neutral	the full service took 00 days ( including weekends ) and delivered what was promised .
neutral	jag hade beställt blommor och choklad till flickvännen , det_blev ingen choklad .
neutral	hade varit trevligt om chokladen blev skickad med !
neutral	gärna lite extra eftersom ni är sena ;)
neutral	the product i purchased was good and the part fit my make and model vehicle correctly .
neutral	no complaint there .
neutral	my complaint is that when i call a company i am dealing_with for information , i don_'_t want to be forced to talk to a computer .
neutral	i want a real live human_being to speak to .
neutral	the price for the package was fair .
neutral	i am not happy with the follow_up of tavelocity .
neutral	the problem is if you want to book a flight all the way to san pedro , ambergris caye , the website will tell you that you are doing so when in reality you are only booking to belize city ... then you have to go to a website for one of the carriers serving belize city and san pedro and book separately .
neutral	kind of confusing .
neutral	if not careful you could end up with tickets to belize city which is not your final_destination .
neutral	the cars available in zurich were very good and clean .
neutral	however , when we arrived we discovered that the car we reserved was too large for just two people .
neutral	when we asked if a smaller car was available the agent acted as though this was a big inconvenience for her to check .
neutral	when she found one she was quick to point out that no money would be refunded for the smaller car , even_though we never asked for a refund .
neutral	she obviously was in a bad mood and forgot who the customer was .
neutral	during the trip the smaller car performed well and our return experience was excellent .
neutral	excellent product to help keep digestion in perfect working order .
neutral	terrible shipping with usps ...
neutral	i ordered from partsgeek several_times and only had an issue once .
neutral	only problem is that one issue was a big one .
neutral	i ordered two parts a fuel_filter and a fuel_pump , they were both under the same tracking_number .
neutral	long_story short .
neutral	the fuel_filter came and the fuel_pump didn_'_t .
neutral	the pump was over $_000 .
neutral	no one knew where it was or could help me find it .
neutral	i was extremely disappointed .
neutral	also the fact that there '_s no direct number to speak with someone at partsgeek was annoying .
neutral	the trouble tickets weren_'_t much help either .
neutral	but anyway i usually don_'_t have problems with these_guys but in that case i was out of over $_000 which wasn_'_t a good feeling and i really needed that part .
neutral	mostly good but could use some fine tuning .
neutral	i worded some headlight bezels for my 00 dodge_truck the shipping and receiving process was pretty fast and packaged well although the product itself was somewhat disappointing the picture was apparently in black and whit so what i was expecting was different than what i recievied and the bezels themselves house a turn_signal lense which was barely attached and i had to hot glue them on to ensure a proper hold .
neutral	i am satisfied with my purchase .
neutral	been using bookit for a long time .
neutral	for the most part , i usually don_'_t have any_problems .
neutral	i just recently tried to modify my reservation and add one night .
neutral	bookit would not do it unless i paid a cancel fee of $_00 . 00 and re - booked .
neutral	that is crazy !
neutral	they would not waive the fee .
neutral	even_though , i was increasing my stay .
neutral	which , i would assume , increases their commission .
neutral	will_definitely reconsider using bookit in the future .
neutral	highly disappointed .
neutral	freindly staff but the orange network is to slow and sometimes my mobile freeze up and cant get any network which i find it annoying thats all
neutral	ordered a driver_side replacement power door_lock switch for a 0000_chevy_truck .
neutral	part came on time and as_described .
neutral	installation was easy and part itself works just fine - but now my key_fob remotes will not work correctly with the new part .
neutral	i have synchronized the remotes per owners_manual - no help .
neutral	i have reprogrammed them per instructions found on internet - still no luck .
neutral	not giving up yet .
neutral	any advice ?
neutral	spent some time looking for checkout but everything else was ok
neutral	the website was super easy .
neutral	i was expecting to receive the book in whole and not just the pages to put in my own binder .
neutral	it was very deceiving .
neutral	the only good thing that came from it was that the price was 0 / 0 of what the complete book is .
neutral	i can make copies too and punch some holes and call it a book .
neutral	i was a little disappointed that no where did it state that the book was just the pages .
neutral	this does not constitute a book , it is called copies .
neutral	not a book !
neutral	otherwise everything was good .
neutral	received order in good time , very satisfied .
neutral	in the end , the product arrived in reasonable time and a great price , so i have little to complain_about .
neutral	but the items took close to a week just to ship .
neutral	and when the two boxes arrived , they were both previously opened .
neutral	had to file down plastic stub to get it to fit
neutral	the instructions were beyond useless .
neutral	the bearings in the yokes fall out constantly .
neutral	the reel really requires 0 people to wind the cover up and remove the reel for storage .
neutral	putting a cover over the pool_cover is next to impossible .
neutral	however it is better_than using the pvc pipe that i used to use .
neutral	the free shipping to me is great .
neutral	to return the core , shipping cost is at the buyers expense .
neutral	so a 00lb alternator boxed shipping cost is half the savings i would have
neutral	made from partsgeek .
neutral	after you place the order , you cannot cancel the order .
neutral	you can only communicate by email , no phone_calls .
neutral	now having to wait for the part , repack the part a certain way only , rma #, and my time involved , ....... .
neutral	its no savings on return core for deposit .
neutral	hopefully the unit will not break because warrenty ......... .
neutral	a savings isn / t what it seemed .
neutral	good service good parts free shipping banner after you purchase a joke and just makes makes me think just how honest are you ?
neutral	sparefoot provided an easy way to search and compare local storage_facilities .
neutral	i found what i was looking for at a seemingly reasonable rate , half off the 0st two months rent , then the full enchilada ..
neutral	however , upon closing the deal , it was disclosed that a $_00 dollar processing fee had to be added on to the advertised rate .
neutral	then when i got to the storage_facility to sign the contract .
neutral	the storage_facility said i had to pay an_additional mandatory " insurance / security " fee of $ 0 dollars per_month .
neutral	i '_m o . k .
neutral	when all costs / fees are mentioned up front .
neutral	not so o . k .
neutral	when someone tries to slide extra fees in on the backside of the deal .
neutral	that '_s slimy , slippery and unprofessional .
neutral	and makes me hesitate to recommend the service even_though it was good up until full price disclosure problems .
neutral	purchased an air_filter and cabin_filter for a 0000_hyundai tucson .
neutral	air_filter fit like a glove , no_issues ..
neutral	the cabin_filter was the wrong_size .... to long and to slim .
neutral	had to cut it down to fit .
neutral	ingen_problemer i at_bestille og betale for min ønskede vare .
neutral	så kom min ordrebekræftelse , med besked_om at at mine_vare ville_blive afsendt inden for 0 - 0 , eller 0 - 0 dage !
neutral	og selvfølgelig gik der 0 dage inden jeg_kunne afhente mine_vare .
neutral	alt i alt fik_jeg dog hvad_jeg_havde_bestilt .
neutral	while the whole_experience was very easy and the money was good but i am still yet to receive my cheque which is very slow .
neutral	its been 0 days since i was told me payment was dispatched .
neutral	leaving the organisation aside for a moment it is fair to say that the radiator i purchased was good quality and supplied at a good price however .........
neutral	when it did not turn up in what i considered to be a reasonable time i rang the company to ask what was going on .
neutral	a gent who could barely_speak_english did not appear to share my frustration about having paid for a product which had not arrived and mumbled something about there being a supplier problem ????
neutral	?
neutral	i was about to cancel the order when i happened to look outside my front_door and guess what was there .........?
neutral	?
neutral	so as i said what they actually did was ok but the organisational skill of the company is none existant which does not bode well should there ever be a problem .
neutral	i ordered a set of moog end links for my car .
neutral	not a tough piece to get whereas my local_autozone had them in stock .
neutral	the parts_geek price was very good , even with shipping_costs .
neutral	so i thought i would try them . the only issue i have is i ordered the parts on 0 - 00 - 0000 , it is now 0 - 00 - 0000 and still no parts .
neutral	and my car is still not driveable .
neutral	i would have expected a 0 or 0 day delivery not 0_weeks .
neutral	save_yourself some aggravation and pick_up parts at your local_auto_zone , unless you havea lot of time on your hands and dont care when your parts arrive .
neutral	good fast delivery but for the price i was expecting 0 x pairs of lenses not just 0 boxes of 00
neutral	you have some bugs in your website , if you forget to check a box or enter data , it will not allow you to go back enter the data and continue .
neutral	example : if you forget to check the terms and conditions box , it errors , tells you to check the box , but it clears the city and state , but will not allow you to re - enter and move on .... you have to start all over , exit the website and begin from the beginning .... a bit frustrating ...
neutral	beställde_en klocka som enligt hemsidan fanns i lager men_som tydligen inte gjorde det på riktigt .
neutral	fick ingen info eller mail om att klockan var slut och att_det skulle ta ett par veckor innan jag_fick den .
neutral	kundtjänsten var trevlig när_jag mailade och frågade vart klockan tagit vägen .
neutral	if you know what you are getting , then betterbathrooms is a good choice .
neutral	the prices ( in the sale at_least ) were competitive with others .
neutral	however , they could not ask what in my mind were fairly simple questions .
neutral	all i wanted to know was the size of a shower screen flat packed .
neutral	they never replied to my email , i was cut_off when i called them and they couldn_'_t find out at the warehouse .
neutral	i then decided to pay for the postage since i was told it would be too large for my car .
neutral	however , when it arrived , it was evident it would have comfortably gone in my car flat !
neutral	had they told me the exact_dimensions , i could have picked it up myself .
neutral	although this was personally quite annoying , i would probably still recommend them to someone_else
neutral	in general , we have found the website useful and the suppliers supportive .
neutral	unfortunately , the challenge comes when a supplier does not operate like most of the others and , unless you read the details carefully , there is a tendency to make some assumptions .
neutral	the part that i ordered came in great service great part fit everything right but i tried to get in touch with somebody there to order another part to find out how it fit and i can '_t get through or nobody will email me back so that '_s not very good
neutral	in my opinion , the price did not reflect the quality , as compared to their competitors , which i have used in the past .
neutral	the message on the card was half written ( it appeared that the printer ran_out of ink halfway through )!!!
neutral	overall i used serenata because their competitor , arena flowers , dropped the ball three_times on important dates .
neutral	not overly_impressed with either one at the moment .
neutral	just a catchie title .
neutral	there was a delivery charge ,
neutral	custom phone support is poor and not very friendly , cards came out great and work just as stated , but dont plan on getting service or support from them .
neutral	i rented a car for 0_weeks , prepaid with complete insurance_coverage .
neutral	when i arrived to retrieve the car i was told that the glass was not covered , and i had to pay an extra 00 euros , and told that glass replacement is very expensive .
neutral	i also wanted to have my wife as a second driver , in my agreement , it stated that this would cost 00 euros , but the agent had stated that the cost had just gone up to 00 euros .
neutral	i don_'_t like to be nickled and dimed .
neutral	how can i ever believe the rental agreements in the future , when the rental company can change the rules when you pick_up the car ?
neutral	i wish i would have bought this frame from the local shop , only $_00 difference and i know the guy .. then atleast my money stays local
neutral	a great bet for a budget night .
neutral	standard fare " make your own waffle " breakfast .
neutral	room was clean .
neutral	i ordered two difficult - to - find frames ( i did not order lenses for them ).
neutral	frames . com employees were very helpful and responsive .
neutral	my order was submitted quickly .
neutral	then came the long wait .
neutral	frames apparently places an order , waits to receive , then qcs , then ships - via a combination of ups and usps .
neutral	the total time elapsed from the confirmation of my order was over two_weeks .
neutral	and once the order was in the hands of ups / usps it became a finger - pointing exercise in who was responsible or delays .
neutral	when they finally arrived they were in perfect_condition and exactly_what i ordered .
neutral	i recently just booked 0 seperate hotels from bookit .
neutral	while_searching for places in daytona i came_across a mystery ocean front hotel deal that was guaranteed 0 . 0_stars .
neutral	i went_ahead and booked it 0nights following another place afterwards that i trusted in case the other hotel didn_'_t meet our expectations .
neutral	after paying for the mystery ocean front hotel it gave_me the name which i was excited to see .
neutral	i immediately looked up the hotel and the reviews to quickly be disappointed .
neutral	the 0 . 0_star_hotel had all but a few reviews reading it more than a 0star hotel with many complaints of roaches , weird smells , doors unable to lock , balconies that staff stated was unsafe to access due to construction , and many more .
neutral	book it . com was easy to book and navigate around i '_m just kinda sad i was told a 0 . 0_star_hotel and now scared i '_m taking my gf to a roach motel .
neutral	only 00 days til our trip , fingers_crossed for us please .
neutral	the other hotel we booked for 0nights after the mystery_hotel has great reviews and we got a great deal on it as well .
neutral	feedback on the zandvoort track day , thursday 0nd august .
neutral	from an overall point of view the day was a great experience , even the rain in the morning didn_’ t dampen the enthusiasm .
neutral	the track suited the car and we had a great time driving on a classic track .
neutral	there were a few small things though , that could have been better .
neutral	i felt that improved communication would have helped .
neutral	as a “ first_timer at zandvoort ”, knowing how to get to the paddock and the garaging on arrival , rather_than just follow your nose , joining the pit lane from the paddock , and having someone sighting the exit of the pits for fast approaching cars , would all have been helpful ..
neutral	the morning briefing was obviously aimed at the majority who had been there before .
neutral	the offer of a couple of sighting_laps would have been good , even if it was just for the newbies .
neutral	at other track days i ’ ve done , this has always happened .
neutral	the instructions on passing on the track , wasn ’ t adhered to very strongly , particularly by the slick shod ferrari boys on their test session .
neutral	oh sorry , it was a dealer day wasn ’ t it !
neutral	i appreciate that i was one of the slowest cars out there but , being monster ’ d so continually , wasn ’ t a pleasant_experience .
neutral	how i didn_’ t gain a yellow ferrari stripe , defeats me .
neutral	many of the 000 ’_s and the sports racers though , were much , much more forgiving and prepared to wait for a safe passing point .
neutral	during the day , the other drivers i spoke with were great to get along with and shared there knowledge freely .
neutral	a number of spectators stopped and chatted with us .
neutral	another highlight was when the zandvoort track director stopped in his 0000 ’_s alfa for a chat , as he too is a huge lotus enthusiast .
neutral	all these things added to the day .
neutral	i ’ m really pleased i ’ ve been to zandvoort and will return , but i ’ m equally as disappointed with my first book - a - track experience .
neutral	knowing that [_link ] were there on the following_day , made we wish i ’ d gone with them .
neutral	i like the company prices but the only_thing is the customer service that you can never get in touch with anyone , i wish they had a phone_number that someone will answer because when it comes to automobile parts is so confusing and we have to make_sure is the right part .
neutral	i wish they had a live_person .
neutral	half of the parts i got were for a toyota pick_up the other half were the correct parts for my toyota_0runner ..... not wanting to deal with returns and all that stuff i have made it work .... but it is a pain to make the wrong parts fit the right application .... i saved alot on the cost of parts but lost out because i did not buy it locally where i could have easily exchanged the parts for the correct ones .
neutral	oh well thats internet shopping for you
neutral	fitter_turned_up without calling first , he said my phone must be turned off .
neutral	when the job was done he said his printer was not working so i am left with no paperwork .
neutral	does not seem a very professional organisation .
neutral	the order went through and was charged to my card before they realized the part was not in stock .
neutral	full charge was refunded several days_later , but do not have a way of notifying you when and if part will be available in near_future .
neutral	despite prepaying wouldnt let_me out at gate .
neutral	ended_up blocking cars and a gate and walking back to the helpdesk to get advice .
neutral	shipped wrong item first time .
neutral	second time speaker blew in days .
neutral	next one i gotlasted a week or two and blew again .
neutral	just beware what u buy .
neutral	every order has_been despatched and delivered within 00_hours , sometimes within 00_hours .
neutral	really cant_fault the service at all .
neutral	their lack of any decent size , anything other than 00ml and the last 0 flavours i bought being nothing like described means that i wont be buying any eliquids from them again .
neutral	the gear is good , atomisers so_far have been good , but thats all i will use them for from now on .
neutral	my recent order was placed on the 0th and not shipped till the 00th .
neutral	they say they ship in 00 - 00_hours .
neutral	no email or notification was sent to tell me if there was a delay in one of the products or anything .
neutral	i called and they still did not have a reason for the delay .
neutral	this is the second time this has happened in the last 0 orders .
neutral	i ran_out of powder and had to go to the local place and spend twice as much .
neutral	i go to sw out of habit but it is time to switch companies .
neutral	i '_ve got more free shakers than i could ever use and its not worth the overpriced shipping .
neutral	other than that , the prices are unbeatable but the shipping adds another 00_% to your order .
neutral	also pay_attention to the expiration_dates on the supplement you order .
neutral	many of the prices are low due to the items being well expired .
neutral	it was easier than_expected , but when i found a higher price at the different websight , my feeling was bit disappointed . except the price , everythng was reasoble , instructions easy to follow . cash quick paid .
neutral	too much stevia in the hemp_protein
neutral	the incorrect part was in the manufacture '_s box .
neutral	the part number was correct for the application , but either the original manufacture mixed it up or parts_geek did .
neutral	currently in the return process , so i have not had this play out fully .
neutral	i am also dissappointed that i will have to pay for shipping the return when the wrong part was sent .
neutral	good service but attention to detail could improve things dramatically .
neutral	would i use skyparksecure again .
neutral	everyone deserves a second chance
neutral	too little time at site , good hosts guides
neutral	i '_ve ordered and received several parts from partsgeek and have been very satisfied with the price and the amount of time it took for the parts to get to me .
neutral	my mechanic even said the parts we purchased for our kia were marked with the same manufacturer '_s logo as the ones he pulled of of the car ... minus the kia logo .
neutral	then this last purchase ... i am not happy with .
neutral	ordered a timing_belt kit for our van and it came with the wrong tensioner .
neutral	the kit was only $_00 but the correct tensioner cost me $_00 plus shipping .
neutral	and after several requests to return the incorrect tensioner for a refund they told me i had to return the entire timing_belt kit in its original packaging ... this is after my mechanic had already installed the rest of the parts on the van .
neutral	after several exchanges with them their only offer to me was a 00_%_discount refund on the $_00 tensioner and 00_%_off my next order .
neutral	and all of this is after i told them that my mechanic discovered that they do not even offer the correct timing_belt kit for my van .
neutral	so this is going to happen to someone_else ... and all i was trying to do was recoup some of my money , lost time without my van and prevent this from happening to someone_else .
neutral	overall very good experience until this last purchase ...
neutral	read the reviews which spoke about park and fly from this hotel when we checked in they wouldn_'_t allow park and fly because we booked through travelocity and wouldn_'_t allow for upgrade .
neutral	please stop my account
neutral	i ordered an exhaust_manifold with integrated catalytic_converter and had to return it for a 0000_pontiac g0 .
neutral	i spoke with a man_named lee .
neutral	he stated my refund would be in the mail a certain date and it has_been 0_weeks now and i have not received my refund yet .
neutral	i have tried to call to check on things but get no answer each time i call .
neutral	the part number : 000 - 000 .
neutral	return_authorization #_0000000 .
neutral	please call me as soon as possible to let_me know when i can be expecting my refund for the merchandise i had to send back .
neutral	thank_you so much for your prompt response !
neutral	donnie hall , iii
neutral	000 - 000 - 0000
neutral	there are what 0 or 0 companies that are authorized to do this work .
neutral	thus , it '_s nearly a monopoly .
neutral	and sure it '_s my fault for not noticing my passport had expired .
neutral	but $_000 ?
neutral	that '_s rough .
neutral	i bet if you knocked 00_%_off your fees , you ' d get 0 times the volume of business and people would feel_like they " saved " big bucks compared to the other_companies .
neutral	chlorine tabs ..
neutral	most were in piece and when i called customer service told me to send the 00lb container back .
neutral	they said they would send a shipping_label via_email and i never received it .. so i cut my losses and used the tabs .
neutral	tabs are great , but i wish most were not in pieces .
neutral	i like the website very much it is very easy to get zygna cards , the only problem i have is they never have the cards i want
neutral	had to pay 00_% more for heating_oil since last order 0 months_ago .
neutral	this is either shameless exploitation of increased demand ahead of the holiday_period or a sign that i will soon need to consider moving house or investing in an_alternative fuel source .
neutral	the problem here is that you cant get anyone on the telephone .
neutral	i got the wrong part , and couldnt find the info on this companies website to reorder the correct one , so i had to call the oe with a vin then call the parts maker to get an interchange number then reorder from parts_geek hoping all the while that i will get the right part .
neutral	this runaround is entirely unacceptable .
neutral	better cataloging and real live customer service folks !
neutral	i am used to getting my orders pretty quick .
neutral	this time it will be 0 - 0 months .
neutral	the filters seem to be of good quality , although i wish they were white instead of orange .
neutral	the only_negative - package was damaged when i received it .
neutral	because another couple was buying a car i had to wait over an_hour for them to finish their financing in order for me to get checked out and sign the paperwork .
neutral	it was a waste of time .
neutral	they should have more than one room that handles financing .
neutral	issue : sensor cables ordered do not line up with the mounting_brackets on my vehicle .
neutral	the cable have built on grommets that are either several inches below the bracket or above .
neutral	please use this email in the future : msgbradleyj @_yahoo . com
neutral	thanks !
neutral	the service was good but the wait time took_forever .
neutral	i ended_up taking 0 + hours of my morning just to get four tires .
neutral	the dealings with whiskey_exchange all went well .
neutral	simple and efficient .
neutral	however they entrusted parcel_force to deliver - either the driver lost or stole the package - got it signed for at wrong_address or forged a signature .
neutral	took weeks to sort out and i missed fathers_day with my dads present by several weeks .
neutral	all in all a bad_experience - but wiskey exchange did there bit well .
neutral	they replaced the bottle that was intercepted and the bottle is lovely .
neutral	richard
neutral	apart_from a telephone_call stating delivery on the wrong day and the delivery driver dropping the filler cap into my tank !!
neutral	i did get my oil .
neutral	appreciate not a boilerjuice fault .
neutral	when i contacted your sales_team by telephone to check availability of an item , the person insisted that i had quoted an incorrect and out of date code for the product , yet i had obtained the code only minutes beforehand from your website !
neutral	i had to be very firm and lead your sales_person through what to click on various pages of the website to get to the produce i wanted .
neutral	when it finally came on his screen he said thats fine how many do you want ?
neutral	i felt throughout that the person did not display a reasonable level of cusomer friendliness .
neutral	having said all of that , the good quality items arrived swiftly and are now installed .
neutral	many_thanks .
neutral	bought two small clip on lights for my dogs collars to see them at night .
neutral	one was obviously not working_properly and not as bright etc so i got in touch and was asked to send back .
neutral	i expected a new replacement ..
neutral	but they just changed the batteries on it and sent the same unit back ... and surprise it is still faulty as is no where near as bright as the other so still no better off .
neutral	why would you change the batteries on a new light when the customer has already said it doesn_'_t work etc ?
neutral	for the sake of £ 0 light etc not worth the effort to go post_office , send back etc .
neutral	easier to go into town and buy it / exchange if faulty .
neutral	unsure if i '_ll buy from them again , not a satisfied customer buying experience , customer_support etc
neutral	i wanted vanilla , not banana flavour but absolutely no chance of amending the order .
neutral	this is a bit primitive .
neutral	surely a 00 minute loop could be put in the order process to allow a change .
neutral	if they have provided gaskets with the water i would have givin more stars .....
neutral	most automotive_parts store will either provide the necessary gaskets or tell the customer the gaskets are not included
neutral	hi , i just bought a couple of jeans from the store and when they arrived i found out that they were too big in the waist for me .
neutral	i repacked the jeans and was filling_out a return note .
neutral	but the only address i could find was a po_box .
neutral	i send it anyway .
neutral	hopefully it will get there ?
neutral	i like this shed , i like the size and shape and the pressure treated wood .
neutral	it was easyish to erect but i would recommend paying for erection as it is not easy getting it square .
neutral	some of the planks look a bit " mouldy " as if they had been stored in a ditch but they all are guaranteed for 00 years so no_worries .
neutral	the floor in the pictures is a very small particle , dense board but the one supplied is a very large particle board and did not support weight flexing when walked on .
neutral	i overboarded with a stronger board ( allow £_00 ).
neutral	telephone help line was unable to help during the build suggesting see what it was like when it was finished .
neutral	a phone_call a week_later from the builders offered no compensation or acceptance of poor quality .
neutral	a good shed at a good price but be prepared to spend extra to finish it off properly ,
neutral	this is my first time using parts_geek ... so_far we are off to a rocky start ... got the wrong part ... however they are working to correct this , and so_far all is proceeding well ... stay_tuned !
neutral	i would double_check the price on the care but has 00 warranty .
neutral	my engine_light is already on and have to get it serviced - called dirvetime and got sent to a mechanic right_away - if it gets fixed on time then i will be a happy customer .
neutral	will update
neutral	i do appreciate rev . com '_s quick_turnaround , and their prices are ok , but they need to realize that magazines and websites don_'_t need them to insert tabs into the copy .
neutral	unformatting the tabs can be troublesome and even impossible .
neutral	product range is good as is the price ( esp when they run promotions ) however the delivery is often rubbish and the follow_up customer service is generally poor ( i '_ve had reason to call 0 times because an order hadn_'_t arrived and only once was it addressed in a way i considered appropriate )?
neutral	nu dau dovada de profesionalism , am_facut comanda joi pt livrare vineri , i - am asteptat mai bine de 0 ore , i - am sunat sa - i intreb daca se mai livreaza dar n - a raspuns nimeni sau aveau telefoanele inchise , am revenit cu un telefon luni si_nu stiau daca s - a livrat sau nu , pana la urma s - a constatat ca_nu s - a facut livrarea , n - au avut bunul simt sa compenseze timpul pierdut , traim in romania si clientul nu e pe primul loc .
neutral	we were not informed by anyone that a passport was needed to finalize the rental_agreement in madrid .
neutral	after taking a taxi to the station , we had to take another round_trip to pick_up the passport from the hotel .
neutral	it cost 00 e extra and lost of preciouse time .
neutral	it did not matter to the office manager .
neutral	it was a bad start for us .
neutral	i have always been very happy with printer_inks until i ordered 0 reams of paper .
neutral	when i opened the box it was a mess all the paper split_open and my ink_cartridges squashed fortunately most was salvageable but i won_'_t order anything heavy with my order again .
neutral	good products , sales and delivery departments but a terrible bad exchange department .
neutral	nicole does not get interested in solvíng the customer problems , not answer calls .
neutral	seemed to be the cheapest online ... and they prmoised free_expedited_shipping
neutral	the first order had me a little_worried .
neutral	the image for the redeem_code was very fuzzy , and i wondered_if it was intentional to cause errors .
neutral	the code was rejected .
neutral	i contacted pc_game_supply , and was pleasantly_surprised to get a very prompt response .
neutral	the fix was in the next_day .
neutral	make the redeem codes a little more readable and make_sure the codes are correct from the go and you might get 0 extra stars from me .
neutral	booked online , fitted the next_day .
neutral	one problem - when i turned_up they ' d overbooked meaning a delay to my allotted_time of around 00_mins .
neutral	supplement_warehouse is usually tops in price .
neutral	however , the shipping_charges will sometimes hike their total price over the total price of some other_sites .
neutral	i e_- mailed them this problem and they sent me instructions on how to enter a shipping pricematch and that they ' d match other_sites shipping prices .
neutral	it didn_'_t work and i paid more for the product than i would have elsewhere .
neutral	they say in their ad that their low_prices cover the comparable shipping charge , making their total price lower - not always true .
neutral	i got the mirror i ordered right_away , but it did not have an electrical hookup to it like my old one .
neutral	i have to move it manually .
neutral	i did not have the time to send it back .
neutral	so i '_ll just live with it .
neutral	i first contacted tennisnuts to purchase some badminton shuttlecocks .
neutral	i didn_'_t know the difference_between the various_options on the website so i contacted the company direct to ask them .
neutral	the response i got was along the lines of " they ' re all pretty similar but the more_expensive ones are better ."
neutral	i received no actual information on the products , the differences_between them , or what would be best suited to the type / level / standard of badminton i was playing .
neutral	in the end i read a bunch of reviews on other_websites and forums and made an informed_decision as to which shuttlecocks to purchase .
neutral	i have purchased from tennisnuts around four or five times now and had no_problems .
neutral	the product arrives on time and in good condition and i have no_complaints about this aspect of their service .
neutral	there is no problem with the product - i now have a couple of jackets a polo and another top .
neutral	service is not so good though . they have products on offer .
neutral	you place an order and then a few_days_later they tell you they are out of stock . a decent computerised stock system should not allow this to happen . they were unable to reset my password when i asked them which_meant opening another email account .
neutral	they said it was a known problem . hopefully they will get their act_together and resolve these problems .
neutral	in their favour - their website is quick and user - friendly .
neutral	otherwise , if you can be bothered , you may as well use the parcels - smashers ( er ... " couriers ") they represent directly , because they are usually a bit cheaper .
neutral	as a company they have zero control over the parcels carriers , which is a shame because most of them are shamefully careless and unreliable .
neutral	and whatever you do , don_'_t waste money on their so - called " insurances " because they don_'_t actually cover anything that is not otherwise utterly indestructable .
neutral	i suspect the scandalous state of the industry as a whole is costing british business millions , if not billions a year - and all because of the laziness and incompetence of those we entrust with the carriage of goods .
neutral	interparcel is just a cog in that mechanism , and i ' d frankly pity them if their support was better when things do go_wrong .
neutral	the lights looked nice but one was defected got them installed and one light was missing an insert so was loose so they had to put zip ties to hold it in place .
neutral	wont buy anymore and didnt send them back since they messed_up this time will probably happen again
neutral	firstly , i understand that loco0 is sifting through a lot of information
neutral	to bring the fares and availabilities to the customer , and i must commend you in the interface which is simple enough ,
neutral	however , when searching for train services , it can be more then a little frustrating .
neutral	so many_times my order requests are not able to go to the basket .
neutral	this i would understand if there was some message indicating why .
neutral	too many travelers ?
neutral	train completely full ?
neutral	construction on tracks ?
neutral	too early to book this train ?
neutral	there is no way
neutral	for me to know as the customer why !
neutral	so what am i to do ?
neutral	just keep trying to submit ?
neutral	i '_ve wasted a lot of time just ' fishing ' around and i think that time would be saved with some feedback from your site .
neutral	i did book a ticket with loco0 - and i ' d like to book more - but i don_'_t know if i have the time or the confidence to just keep trying and trying without_any kind of feedback and direction .
neutral	there is only one concern ,,, am affraid if it go bad ,,,,, wonder is will properly cover with the warranty since ,, alot people make stataments the part u buy on the internet will not b cover with warranty since there is no way to contact vendor ......
neutral	thank_you for your service will us you again
neutral	i like neronte product
neutral	i was a little disappointed not to receive a full_refund - as ihad been led to believe .
neutral	online shopping was relatively easy , good selection .
neutral	i even chatted via im with a customer service rep to make_sure i had the right part .
neutral	they guaranteed / assured me that it was .
neutral	of course , it was not .
neutral	that was very disappointing .
neutral	i ordered two parts and the shippping process was quick , informative and easy .
neutral	however , one part arrived with damage so i need to return .
neutral	filled_out the form and waiting reply .
neutral	wines were sent on time as scheduled .
neutral	my complaint is the shipping_costs were much too high .. $ 0 . 00 / bottle
neutral	i '_ve been a customer of very for some years_now .
neutral	have always found them helpful on the phone and their products price ok for a catalogue .
neutral	often have good offers
neutral	how ever their choice of delivery services is appalling !
neutral	twice_now i '_ve waited in and been let_down .
neutral	the bed i ordered took yodel three_attempts to delivery as they got lost or address wrong .
neutral	very did refund postage .
neutral	i ordered a sofa and chair this month , july .
neutral	booked for 00st july .
neutral	i way away on holiday until 00th_july so this date was a good choice .
neutral	whilst away i get a text to say the delivery had failed !!
neutral	i had to wait_until my return as i wasn_'_t knocking up international_calls on my phone .
neutral	then a delivery message to say the items to be delivered on the monday , 00nd .
neutral	ok i thought , i '_m home now , that '_s ok .
neutral	lorry turns up 00_mins late from their selected delivery slot , but only with the armchair .
neutral	so i rang arrow .
neutral	and the heifer dust excuses from the operator about quality control and delivery slots !
neutral	i '_ve now got to wait for another delivery .
neutral	and even_though they messed_up , they won_'_t give me a slot time !
neutral	!
neutral	c ' mon very , sort your deliveries out ....
neutral	i must add , the small parcel delivery chap is ace , and if i '_m out , will sort my package out or pop back later in the day !!
neutral	!
neutral	( this review concerns the london_heathrow_airport ( bath road ) premier_inn and not premier_inn hotels in general )
neutral	my experience of this hotel was largely good with the exception of two specific issues .
neutral	my first issue was that both the sheets and the pillows on the bed had brown stains on them .
neutral	furthermore , i found a squashed piece of chocolate ( at_least i hope it was chocolate !)
neutral	stuck to the sheets .
neutral	i imagine this will have been a one - off as the rest of the room was clean but it made me doubt the cleanliness of the room i was sleeping in .
neutral	my second issue was that when i came to check - out , the person at the reception desk could not care less .
neutral	he didn_'_t even look up from what he was doing , and certainly didn_'_t ask me about my stay .
neutral	this , coupled_with the efficient but impersonal check - in machine , resulted_in a very unfriendly impression from the hotel .
neutral	other than this , the hotel is comfortable , has plenty of facilities , and for an airport hotel is very quiet .
neutral	ordered a hope headset which was at a competitive price even before they offered an_additional discount they have on hope products at the moment .
neutral	unfortunately i wasn_'_t delivered the part in the colour i ordered .
neutral	i then had the hassle of sending it back and waiting for the replacement although it was sent next_day delivery .
neutral	i would use them again but a little room for improvement please .
neutral	i ordered wiper_blades that were supposed to fit my vehicle .
neutral	they did not .
neutral	i also ordered hinge pins , and saved a bunch on those .
neutral	no_complaints there .
neutral	most companies that i '_ve dealt_with offer a free shipping return_policy , especially when you send the wrong merchandise .
neutral	petflow . com is a useful service for pet_owners whose pets have special dietary needs .
neutral	although there are other comparable services on the market , petflow '_s prices are slightly_lower , and shipping options are more robust .
neutral	the biggest problem is that the website is slightly hard to use and prices increase often .
neutral	moreover , despite a specialization in veterinary - grade pet_foods , petflow once sent me a case of the wrong food , which can be really dangerous for an animal with a special_diet .
neutral	when i contacted customer service , i was sent a replacement case immediately .
neutral	took_forever when i phoned , and when i left message to contact me the system did not work well .
neutral	finally got through via phone , and everything was good thereafter .
neutral	they need more phone agents !
neutral	they are very slow to respond to email and slow to process orders .
neutral	they charge like they will ship quickly but they don_'_t .
neutral	i assume they make money by overcharging for shipping .
neutral	it takes 0 - 0_weeks to get a single part .
neutral	when the part arrives , the box is all beat up .
neutral	i ordered two different items that were the same and the first was in a larger shipping container with no padding .
neutral	the second shipped as - is , with no box .
neutral	the parts are cheap but work as intended , so_far .
neutral	i ordered a crankshaft position_sensor for my 000sl .
neutral	the order process online was smooth , but after 0 - 0 days i received an_email_saying this part was unavailable and that i would be getting a refund .
neutral	a partial_refund , as they did not refund the insurance premium that i paid to cover the non_- delivery of this fairly expensive part .
neutral	not a lot of money , but since the order was never processed , there was nothing to insure .
neutral	i ordered through another supplier and paid $_00 more for the part , but they had the part and it shipped within a day .
neutral	i would think_twice before using parts_geek again .
neutral	there was nothing to make me really angry - i could cope with it all ok - but there were little things which would have been easy to put right .
neutral	a light_bulb wasn_'_t working in the room ; the main door wouldn_'_t shut properly from the outside ; the room ( in fact the whole hotel ) could have done with a fresh coat of paint ; at breakfast there wasn_'_t enough cutlery out - we had to steal it from other tables .
neutral	when we came back to the hotel in the evening , someone had been into the room , left the tv and the lights on and had taken the old towels but not left any new ones .
neutral	when challenged with this as i checked out , the receptionist said they were " very busy " on sunday , which i didn_'_t think was true .
neutral	on the good side , the beds were comfortable and warm , breakfast was tasty , the tv worked_fine and the staff were friendly .
neutral	i had a question about a part compatibility issue .
neutral	i got no personalized reply .
neutral	just an_rma_number .
neutral	i had to go to another web_site to verify the part was compatible .
neutral	i suggest reading what you customer is asking as a starting_point .
neutral	good evening ,
neutral	the ordering and receiving the part was very fast and easy .
neutral	the part itself was defective .
neutral	one side of the plastic connector was broken when i received it .
neutral	the part was loose inside the original main box , no raping at all !
neutral	( and allowed the part to shake around ?)
neutral	that original main part box was than rapped well , and put inside another box .
neutral	( this was good ) ( but to late )
neutral	i think if the part itself had been rapped in the original box , that might have solved the problem .
neutral	i decided to install the part anyway , hoping this would not effect the electronics part of it ?
neutral	also , i didn_'_t want to deal with returning it !
neutral	that '_s good for you as well !
neutral	ra pomroy
neutral	ordering was straightforward and deleivery fine .
neutral	but trying to get all the cooton wool out of the bottle .
neutral	it came out in dribs and drabs to my intense frustration
neutral	easy to order from website but shipping was twice as long as quoted
neutral	completely_satisfied until i have to deal with the safepay feature .
neutral	two main points .
neutral	the site is very poorly maintained in terms of product placement .
neutral	for example , i was looking for another v / v mini lavatube the other day , and it just would not show me them .
neutral	but i know they sell them , because i bought one recently .
neutral	then when i went to checkout after buying other stuff , a little box advertising them appeared on the checkout page .
neutral	just not made easy to navigate .
neutral	but the main issue with this company is the stock_levels .
neutral	with products like this , the customers want a reliable service where they can obtain their favorite e liquids and cartomisers without a second thought .
neutral	and before they run out and have to spend time searching elsewhere for a similar product they may not have tried before .
neutral	the stock control of this company is pathetic , even for the british made products they sell !
neutral	i for one am looking for a more reliable supplier .
neutral	was not pleased with quality of furniture already falling_apart and we paid a delivery fee and they want me to pack what is wrong in my car an bring it back to the store .
neutral	i spent 0000 . 00 and paid 000 . 00 delivery fee and you want me to drive these products back to the store .
neutral	i work night shift and have to sleep during the day this isn_'_t a easy task .
neutral	the store was very helpful in resolving the issue but i don_'_t have the time to get there .
neutral	my girlfriend is home all day i think someone should come and exchange the defective products ( cushions falling_apart , table leg finish is faulted on coffee_table and chair for dinette is defective
neutral	thank_you
neutral	my debit_card was compromised this last fall and i was not informed by identity_guard but by a service employed by my bank .
neutral	i did not receive a report from identity_guard after the fact .
neutral	on superfast laptop , on firefox 00 , pages take way too_long to refresh .
neutral	i ordered a passenger_side_rear_view_mirror .
neutral	it had a great price , shipped quickly and fit the car well .
neutral	i was very disturbed with packing .
neutral	it was shipped in the original thin_cardboard_box without an outer carton .
neutral	the box was damaged , although i was surprised to find the mirror undamaged .
neutral	this website provides an excellent service for pc_games in particular , especially when it offers new games at better prices than steam .
neutral	however , the autokey service is a bit finicky , and could do with some refinement .
neutral	i recommend this website to anyone_who is a pc_gamer .
neutral	i wanted the merkur hd kit just didn_'_t want the omega shaving_cream and wanted the tortoise brush instead of black .
neutral	read the reviews on this package and a gentleman has a long review praising royal_shave for doing just this .
neutral	when i called to make my order they will not work with you at all on these packages .
neutral	says they are prepackaged the way it states and they can change nothing even if it '_s the same price .
neutral	so to get what i wanted i had to order everything separately and pay more for that package .
neutral	i got the same brush only a different color and instead of omega i got poraso which was a $ 0 dollar difference , i would of gladly paid .
neutral	don_'_t think it '_s a good practice to have a customer praising you for something your not gonna do in your reviews , if you really read the reviews .
neutral	they did in the end give me a 00_%_discount on my full order and it arrived very quickly in great condition and the representative was very helpful at everything else .
neutral	i had a total of two .
neutral	about a year_ago there were a dozen .
neutral	what has happened ?
neutral	has global_airport_parking screwed_up badly ?
neutral	nobody_wants to use them any longer ?
neutral	customer service needs improvement .
neutral	buttons looked great but we do over 0 , 000 , 000 buttons a year and the price just isn_'_t competitive to use them on a full time basis .
neutral	would recommend for special projects but that '_s about it .
neutral	i ordered two gift_certificates for my two bosses and one of those certs wasn_'_t filled until well after christmas when i called to find out if it was ever filled .
neutral	then to add_insult to injury a cert was emailed to my boss ( albeit late ) that didn_'_t work because the number was issued twice and the other recipient got their order in first .
neutral	in the end they made good and upped the certificate value by 00_% to my boss ( with nothing to me ) but the efforts i had to go through to get there made it a bad_experience for me .
neutral	pureformulas did fine on delivering the product , but the product is awful .
neutral	it was a waste of money because i can '_t get it down .
neutral	quite disappointing .
neutral	won_'_t be buying again .
neutral	for such a small package ( one packet of frontline ) the delivery charge was way too high .
neutral	and , it took 00 days to get to my house !
neutral	too_long !
neutral	and not that great of a deal
neutral	it appeared no one proofread the work .
neutral	had to do extensive editing .
neutral	quick_turnaround , fair price .
neutral	move your first time customer '_s box below the username and password location instead of in a separate box .
neutral	i spent 00_minutes on hold waiting for an answer on why my username would not work .
neutral	after getting your letter i did not consider myself as a first time log in customer .
neutral	i bought a front_license_plate mount for a dodge_ram .
neutral	it came in a week and was packed well , and was cheaper_than the others i saw .
neutral	the one thing that bugged me was that there were no mounting bolts or screws .
neutral	there was no hardware of any kind other than the bracket .
neutral	i don_'_t know if this is how its done , or if i was supposed to pay extra for the stuff i need to attach it to my bumper ... but it just seems *&% backwards .
neutral	who sells something that needs to be attached and then doesn_'_t include the attaching materials ?
neutral	!
neutral	so , i had to wait a week to get it , and then i had to go to lowe '_s and buy bolts and screws to put it on .
neutral	in this case , i would have been better off buying locally .
neutral	they had the best prices on parts for my cars .
neutral	but one items was delivered , the other was reported delivered .
neutral	it showed_up 0 days_later .
neutral	but in between i filed a missing shipment notice .
neutral	their website says that they take no responsibility for missing shipments , it is all on the shipper and they could take up to 00 days to investigate and refund money .
neutral	that time is all on you , the company won_'_t even ship a replacement unless you pay for it again .
neutral	that is simply unacceptable when the company picks and pays the shipper .
neutral	first part delivered & ordered wrong .
neutral	having to reorder was not a great experience since return shipping is not included .
neutral	i understand a restocking_fee but since had to repurchase , thought a return_label would be sent !
neutral	i forgot to order a spoon which cost 00p and i asked for it to be included in the order of course saying i would pay , however , it was not possible and so asked if they could send it separately via the post .
neutral	this was also not possibe and i was not going to pay 00p for a spoon and then the minimum £ 0 deliver cost so i thought that this was not acceptable as they can obviously pay a second class stamp and a 00p spoon .
neutral	delivery requested did arrive .
neutral	i will not be using again
neutral	smyril line to iceland is absent without good reason .
neutral	buying the cheapest cross - channel hop with car using a mobile running mini - opera was tedious as your site is not well suited to the very small screen .
neutral	the purchase had to be repeated due to failure at the last stage .
neutral	good for you , your software recognised this ok , i hope .
neutral	some simple improvements would be welcome for next time .
neutral	keep it simple , compact , & contrasty - please !
neutral	ig did not catch a fraudulent use of my credit_card on march 00 , 0000 .
neutral	i had to get a qwery call from the card issuer to find out about it .
neutral	this is not good service , and i question if it is worth for me to continue with ig ..
neutral	would refer a friend but tell them to expect two_weeks to get what they ordered .
neutral	i forhold_til mange_andre e_- butikker er forsendelsesomkostningerne høje .
neutral	umiddelbart et_stort_udvalg , men ved nærmere eftersyn er_der mange modeller hvor_der kun er få størrelser og de er typisk meget store eller meget små .
neutral	ellers et ok firma som_man_kan stole på .
neutral	was offered £_00 for a phone that was listed as ' not working ' but then only recieved £ 0 . 00 as it as ' not working '.
neutral	service was good though , but not happy with the results .
neutral	these compatible_ink_jet cartridges are considerably_cheaper_than the manufacturer '_s product .
neutral	you need to be_careful installing them as it is easy to create a leak when removing the plastic tab .
neutral	it is difficult to know how long they last compared to the hp product .
neutral	my hp_printer keeps telling_me i have a non_- hp cartridge installed but it still seems to work .
neutral	easy to order but you need to know exactly how much you need .
neutral	get it wrong and need extra litres you have to reorder amd wait even thougj the tanker is there already thete !
neutral	ordered mine and no information on delivery tanker just turned_up out the blue lucky i was there yo unlock the tank !
neutral	price needs to be good but most oil companies will match the price if you haggle , give you a delivery day , will fill you up and do not wamt payment untill after delivery not two_weeks before .
neutral	unless you get a great price unmatched elsewhere you get a better service elsewhere .
neutral	i bought three items from deep_blue .
neutral	two were great .
neutral	one was wrong because i had mistakenly ordered a replacement strap for an alladin computer not realizing it was different to the uwatec dive timer i was trying to repair .
neutral	called and was told that if i returned it i would get a refund .
neutral	ok , so how do i get the strap that i need ?
neutral	answer : don_'_t know , you '_ll have to go back to the manufacturer ??
neutral	who is the uwatec dealer ?
neutral	deep_blue or me ?
neutral	i had expected after explaining my mistake to hear " no problem , if we have not got it in stock we '_ll order it and pop it in the post ".
neutral	no such luck !
neutral	i called one of deep blues ' competitors and received the strap the following_day .
neutral	i would hit up rawfoodworld ten times as much if their shipping was on point .
neutral	all of the competing raw_food outlets ship with precision , ninja - like professionalism .
neutral	i '_m sorry to say that rawfoodworld takes their sweet time , so i only order with them a few_times a year now .
neutral	prompt service as far as your part being shipped and delivered !
neutral	but , on the other hand , the return procedure is horrible !
neutral	there is no number to contact anyone for customer service , except for a fax_number , or by e_-_mail !
neutral	unless they make my return expierence a pleasant one , i will by no means order anymore merchandise from parts parts_geek llc .
neutral	i had a terrible time placing an order because of all the info required
neutral	pre_- recorded_commentary was okay .
neutral	it was cold and only the open air seats were open .
neutral	later got a 0st level seat , but did not have a good view of the seats .
neutral	the boat cruise was nice to see the sites from the river .
neutral	we did not use it as much as expected .
neutral	in time i had a friction with a order ... is solved ... but i still remenber it ...
neutral	support takes days to respond with a tracking_number , some packages ship fast , others take days to ship .
neutral	but once it arrives , the product is fantastic !
neutral	received two different_kinds of steering rod ends for the same vehicle .
neutral	not very happy about that .
neutral	dont understand how that could happen .
neutral	receieved the correct control_arms though .
neutral	received half of my order still_waiting on the rest .
neutral	bought these tickets well in advance for early arrival to tucson and they were changed from getting into tucson at 0 : 00_pm to 00 : 00_pm .
neutral	we are in our 00s , and had to except the time change when notified .
neutral	pamela price
neutral	normally great service but this time they forgot to include ice_cream and meat seasoning .
neutral	was refunded but will have to wait for next order to buy them .
neutral	i have requested an_rma and was forced to pay more at the dealer due to the fact that my system was open when i found that the parts were for the wrong vehicle .
neutral	i looked at the web_site again and there was no mistake on my part about the fact that they were ordered for a dual air system .
neutral	however in fairness i may in my haste have ordered the wrong accumulated .
neutral	i will try again at some other time .
neutral	i will also be more careful about what i order .
neutral	thanks
neutral	the tailgate_handle i ordered for my 0000_chevy silverado was good , but the trim_piece that goes around it was a piece of junk .
neutral	the handle had the correct matte_finish , while the trim_piece was glossy black .
neutral	the trim_piece also broke upon installation , as the tabs at the top were incorrectly spaced .
neutral	i was able to install with some velcro strips , but will have to purchase the correct part somewhere_else .
neutral	love the products , shame they are manufactured abroard !
neutral	despite email and telephone to barracta re query about garment , no response , when finally i did get a reply to request about a return the person had no_idea that it had already been despatched , so seem rather untogether as a business !
neutral	prices can be good but dispatch can take several days so don_'_t use ps if you need rapid delivery .
neutral	i was also annoyed by the carrier who did not deliver on the day i received an_email from them to say it was on the van for delivery .
neutral	to make me more annoyed , they sent me a message that evening which implied they had tried to deliver - they hadn_'_t .
neutral	the order turned_up the next_day .
neutral	i ordered a package from dv000 but unfortunately the courier delivered it to the incorrect address .
neutral	it did take just over a week for the package to finally reach but the customer service team at dv000 were always helpful and remained in contact .
neutral	unfortunately the same can not be said about there current courier .
neutral	it took them a lot longer_than 00_hours to contact me in the first instance .
neutral	as a lot of the business will be by internet sales i would suggest using more local delivery people or allow additional information within the postal address as a few lines is sometimes not sufficient .
neutral	i didn_'_t have any problem ordering , paying or receiving my oil .
neutral	the only_thing was i could have got it cheaper by doing it myself .
neutral	unfortunately , the price was quoted at the weekend and i guessed a cold snap would be on its way fairly soon so decided to purchase the oil .
neutral	even_though i got a further discount to bring the price down to 00 . 00p , i got a quote from a local company for 00 . 00p .
neutral	see_above
neutral	0 ) la corse , france : a +, car , services ....
neutral	0 ) pisa , italia : d -, bad car , bad services .
neutral	got the book i ordered but was wrong version got a return rma was shipped back waiting for return verification .
neutral	will let you know what happens
neutral	i bought these trunk_struts for my aunt '_s 0000_pontiac_grand_prix ( with spoiler ).
neutral	the old_ones came off easily but the new ones are too_long to install and to difficult to compress .
neutral	she is having to get a professional to put them on .
neutral	the audio quality of the phone_power service is decent .
neutral	i have a 0mb cable modem connection .
neutral	with ooma the audio quality was great , with google_voice the audio was pretty poor .
neutral	sometimes the audio gets really poor and the caller or i need to repeat ourselves .
neutral	most of the time is is good enough to understand .
neutral	i don_'_t use the phone much , so this is acceptable .
neutral	i do notice a fair amount of spam callers coming in on my new phone_power number .
neutral	i wish there was a way to block all calls to the phone_power number .
neutral	i do not use this number .
neutral	i also wish i could port my real number to phone_power .
neutral	i rarely get a spam call on that number .
neutral	forwarding calls , caller_id , and the blacklist all work .
neutral	i could not figure_out how to block an entire area code or prefix .
neutral	this would be great .
neutral	i found some tips in the forum , but they appear to be for some previous software because i could not get them to work .
neutral	products very good priced pity about the slow delivery
neutral	the company rep met us on time , the only problem was he was not wearing any uniform of id properly , was wearing dirty trousers and shoes and did not look like a chauffer at all .
neutral	if i owned the company , i would have them dressed in a nice clean uniform with a logo and proper id .
neutral	other chauffers arrived for other_travellers looking as they should .
neutral	he checked the car over quickly , and then gave_us a small bit of blue paper as a reciept .
neutral	on return , i called the mobile number they gave_us when we collected our_luggage , the time was 00 :_00am .
neutral	the number was answered with " parking ", not completely proffesional , he told us to meet us at the drop_off point at_gatwick north .
neutral	when we walked there our car was there , very prompt which was a good point . i noticed straight_away that a light_bulb had blown , but the driver did not mention this .
neutral	we drove home with our young_children , and the next_day i checked the car .
neutral	i was not impressed .
neutral	i dropped the car off in clean condition , was valeted 0 days before travel .
neutral	inside the drivers footwell was covered in mud , all over the carpets and mats , crayon writing over the inside of the windscreen , muddy footprints in the rear of the car , a couple of light scratches to the front_bumper , and on the inside my mobile_phone holder had been completely snapped_off .
neutral	i shall not be using this company again , i will use a more professional company .
neutral	my only_complaint is that a lot of clothes i would have bought are not available in my size
neutral	considering that i am a medium / large i was shocked that some products were only available in small and xl
neutral	if my size was available on certain products i would '_ve purchased more
neutral	i '_ve placed three orders with these_guys and so_far so good .
neutral	on this third order there is an item with a core .
neutral	there is no information provided on how to return the item and get the core_charge credited back .
neutral	the only way to contact them is to submit a support email .
neutral	they claim they will answer in less_than two_days but in the past i have waited 0 or 0 days before they answered .
neutral	i think this will be my last order with them .
neutral	eventually i will need to contact them and speak to a person and their method of contact is unacceptable .
neutral	i also don_'_t like their return_policy , even when it is their fault , the customer must pay return shipping .
neutral	the best did what they said they would do .
neutral	envelope sent with in two_days . they then kept me informed by email . money sent with in just over a week . ive used other_sites and had to chase them for payment don_'_t go any where else but envirofone premier league
neutral	bravofly did all that they said they would and their instructions were clear and easy to follow .
neutral	the embedded link to the online check in site was very useful .
neutral	no_problems with on line check in or the flights out and back by lufthansa , which were comfortable with good cabin service .
neutral	on our return flight lufthansa '_s hold baggage check - in desk ( s ) were inadequately staffed and it took over 00_minutes to deposit our baggage .
neutral	there were plenty of unmanned desks .
neutral	airport security also had long_queues but that is not the fault of the airline .
neutral	my overall star_rating reflects the delays on the ground .
neutral	i had booked 0 places in the last month .
neutral	0 of them didnt find the reservation :
neutral	0 of them upgraded our room at same price .
neutral	0 of them said sorry look for another place to stay , even when hostels . com charged me the deposit .
neutral	it was an awkful experience because it happened at 00 . 00pm .
neutral	i wrote to hostels . com 0 week_ago but im still_waiting for a response about it .
neutral	the 0 bookings left went ok .
neutral	book it did a great job with our vacation except for our flight arrangements .
neutral	my wife and i were fourteen rows apart and informed by the airlines that the booking companies payed for so many seats and could care less where you sat as long as they had the seats filled .
neutral	i cannot_comment as my part has not yet been delivered .
neutral	i am_hopeful other than the slow deliovery , i will be satisfied .
neutral	it has_been 00 days today including weekends .
neutral	i tracked it ( easy to do using the pg website ) and expect it to arrive_tomorrow .
neutral	mechanic noticed a fault on the rear 0 tyres , and replaced them instead of the 0 front as requested ( saved me 0 points , so im grateful for this ).
neutral	then dunlop delivered a faulty tyre .
neutral	so all in all , its going to take 0 visits to change 0 tyres .
neutral	not kwikfits fault though .
neutral	happy with service .
neutral	friendly and professional
neutral	i ordered the part and had questions after ordering and no customer service number .
neutral	i emailed and no reply for 0 days .
neutral	when i got a reply it was as if they never read my question .
neutral	all in all the part worked , but customer service is nothing to brag about - but the price was the lowest on the part but with shipping it equaled out to the others .
neutral	everything has_been going well .
neutral	i asked to port a number , took all the steps i was told to take , sent the email i was asked to send .
neutral	nothing has happened in a month .
neutral	i '_ve not even heard from someone .
neutral	purchased far_cry 0 insane_edition for my son on christmas day .
neutral	it was the best deal going by_far .
neutral	went on reviews for the site and main complaints were for long delivery delays and bad packaging and items arriving damaged .
neutral	too be fair it was over the | christmas and new year period so it did not arrive in 0 - 0 working days more like 0 , i think website could have stated this .
neutral	also the box did come a little damaged and my son did collect them for prestige then he would have been slightly upset , however all contents were as_promised .
neutral	probebley would use again if we were desperate for a good price
neutral	the ink cartidges seem to be ok but nothing special .
neutral	being remanufactured they were difficult installing and the quality was no better_than that i received at cartridge world where the prices were about half as much !
neutral	i don_'_t appreciate that the phones are not answered .
neutral	i had questions_regarding the delay in my order after i paid for overnight delivery and haven_'_t been able to talk to anyone .
neutral	email responses were 0 days apart .
neutral	we used airbnb for 0 apartment rentals during our european vacation .. we used housetrip for 0 rental .
neutral	housetrip is really great , but really needs to have the security deposit ( money held in case of incidentals ) managed as does triphouse ... it is an inconvenience to have to carry 000eur to give to the host , and then to arrange having it back at the end of the stay .
neutral	other than that housetrip is good .
neutral	i ordered 0 / 0 x 00mm domino dowels which stayed in " processing " mode so i called and cancelled the order intending to collect the same from the store as your warehouse had none .
neutral	00miles to your shop which i have done quite a few_times .
neutral	i am still_waiting for the debit against my account for the purchase amount !
neutral	however i was able to get the dominos elsewhere and only 00 miles_away .
neutral	the massage_table was good quality and light_weight though i was very dissapointed that after being told i would have next_day delivery on it this wasn_'_t the case and i wasted a day waiting for an arrival that finally came the following_day and had to be left with my neighbour !
neutral	overall a good product but please don_'_t advertise next_day delivery if it '_s not what you provide .
neutral	i sign_up in dec . 0000 an payed my premium with credit_card as they asked of me , been calling ever since jan . 0000 to ask where is my bill for the month an no bill since dec . here it is april_0000 and have not got a bill , they keep saying it is on the way but hey what happen to jan , feb , march , payment plus now in april .
neutral	don_'_t understand_why !
neutral	i need payment so i can pay my monthly dues !
neutral	i ordered an origin game code , and as i live overseas from my home usa billing_address my order was flagged as potentially fraudulent .
neutral	this isn_'_t something new so i was somewhat expecting it .
neutral	i was told to use their support system to provide identification to allow the transaction to be promised .
neutral	their support page states that most inquiries and support answers take 0 hour but could take up to 00_hours .
neutral	i ordered before their uk office hours stated , so i went out after providing the necessary documents and came home later at night around 00_hours_later to find i had not been taken_care of yet .
neutral	i wrote a quick note in their support system and asked if they planned on taking_care of it within that work day .
neutral	they replied about 0 hours_later telling_me to attach the necessary identification documents to the support system .
neutral	i had already done that in the first message , but i attached them again just so they could get it in the newer message .
neutral	i still wasn_'_t getting that quick service i had expected , so i sent a message on their fb and twitter accounts .
neutral	finally after about 00 + hours of waiting for my code i finally got it .
neutral	now assuming they now know my identification and paypal is legitimate , i '_m hoping i won_'_t have to go through this again ( this was actually my second order , and i had to identify myself then , so maybe i '_ll have to do it everytime ...).
neutral	the prices are good , and the codes have worked both_times , so i '_ll just chalk it up to a slow day and hope for better service in the future .
neutral	purchase good except for the courier who took 0 days and many chase ups by me to make the delivery .
neutral	the first delivery failed because the courier required a signature and we were not home ..
neutral	i texted and called the courier mobile number to no effect and only had the delivery effected by ringing hotonner .
neutral	your online delivery advice should have a note to allow the customer to elect to have the parcel left without signature .
neutral	however the courier driver obviously did not care
neutral	service was very good .
neutral	ease of use in web was fine .
neutral	two day shipping was one week , thus poor .
neutral	the web_site is easy to use and they provide status every_step of the way .
neutral	not the quickest for getting the parts out the door but you get what you order .
neutral	made the mistake on an order and ordered the wrong part .
neutral	submitted to return the item and it became a very lengthy process that took several days just to get an_rma so i could send the part back .
neutral	have not gotten the refund yet which i am sure it will be another lengthy process .
neutral	happy with the parts that i received once i ordered the correct one .
neutral	if you are not in a hurry and don_'_t make a mistake on the order , they do have good prices on the items i looked at .
neutral	all of the most_important things were in order :
neutral	0 .
neutral	pick_up location was very clear .
neutral	0 .
neutral	we were picked_up on time .
neutral	0 .
neutral	they took us to the right place .
neutral	0 .
neutral	they picked us up on time .
neutral	0 .
neutral	we had no problem with ticketing .
neutral	my biggest_complaint is that the bus windows were covered with an overlay that made it impossible to see out of them .
neutral	i would have loved to have been able to see the countryside , neighborhoods , etc .
neutral	i understand that wb harry_potter studios was the main attraction , but it would have been great to be able to see out of the windows on the 0 + hour bus ride .
neutral	the staff was not friendly or polite in any way .
neutral	i don_'_t think being cordial is a pre_- requisite , but it felt very out of touch with the way the tourist industry works in london .
neutral	i have met several tsa agents that made me feel more welcome than the staff at golden_tours .
neutral	i ordered a part for my 00 chevy_blazer only to receive the wrong item .
neutral	getting anyone to respond is truly a hassle as they do not have a phone you can really reach a real_person at .
neutral	all e_mail inquiries are at minimum 00_hours before they respond .
neutral	i finally got an_rma to return the wrong items and decided to order another as they were one of the few i seen posting the item i needed .
neutral	i did receive it but again i watched my tracking_number sit with no activity for many days and then when it finally did register activity it was the day it arrived .
neutral	i did finally get the correct part and the price is ok but after a month from my first ordered placed i am still_awaiting my refund .
neutral	jeg mangler at få specificeret hvad_jeg egentligt betaler for .
neutral	beløbene er_meget ujævnt fordelte pga .
neutral	ændringer i jeres omkostninger , kortgebyr mv .
neutral	så_det_er_meget meget svært at gennemskue priserne .
neutral	den_eneste måde at få overblikket er at få tilsendt en faktura for hver afregning , men_så skal_man til gengæld betale ekstra faktureringsgebyr .
neutral	det må kunne gøres bedre !
neutral	we had to wait almost 00_minutes before the bus left to take us to the cruise_terminal .
neutral	we were told it was a last_minute change from the terminal parking area , but there were small vans available to take us without having to wait on the bus to do round trips .
neutral	we were told we would not be charged the $_00 fee for transport but got charged upon our return .
neutral	the workers were friendly but not sure the $_00 savings versus parking at jaxport was worth it
neutral	i purchased an item from you .
neutral	it wasn_'_t in stock , nor did you know when you could get one .
neutral	i did get my refund within a day or two .
neutral	i just bought it somewhere_else , gut it should '_ve been taken off line .
neutral	( no big_deal really )
neutral	we showed_up to pick_up our rental in florence .
neutral	it was at an avis location .
neutral	i presented my papers .
neutral	the agent said , where is your voucher ?
neutral	" here is my voucher ," i said .
neutral	" this is not your voucher ," she said .
neutral	the e_-_mail receipt is not your receipt as it is in the us .
neutral	and they will not take a passport as proof of identity .
neutral	and they will not access and print the voucher for you .
neutral	she told us to go down the street to the internet cafe to print our voucher .
neutral	the internet cafe was closed , out of business .
neutral	the travel_agency next door identified the next internet cafe two blocks_away and we returned with our voucher .
neutral	every thing else worked as expected .
neutral	hey auto_europe , avis .
neutral	this is an annoying problem ....
neutral	controller looks great , asthetically flawless .
neutral	love the gold and bullets button combination .
neutral	when it comes to functionality , that '_s where i run_into some problems .
neutral	i found that two of my buttons stick occasionally .
neutral	l0 and r0 causing me to hold tacticals and fire continuosly respectivly .
neutral	i found that the controller also has button amd stick lag if not plugged in and it runs interferrence with my sony pulse headset .
neutral	overall i feel a three star_rating is fair .
neutral	as for controller_chaos as a company i had no prroblems with the service or actually using the website .
neutral	i sent in a inquiry as to why the buttons were sticking and i received a response almost_immediately .
neutral	hopefully these issues can be resolved which i '_m sure they will be .
neutral	overall i am satisfied with controllerchaos as i am sure my issues with this controller are an isolated_incident .
neutral	great job guys i will be back for all my controller needs in the future !!
neutral	!
neutral	north_shore was quick to get the product to me and did their part in the middleman sales process .
neutral	but the header seal i ordered was not up to the standards that i believed when i purchased it .
neutral	the seal is awfully flimsy and even the support area where the screws go are quite weak .
neutral	this item may work for a few weeks but i look for it to be replaced in the near_future .
neutral	good voice connection quality most of the time .
neutral	sometimes , i can hear the other side '_s voice but the other cannot hear from me .
neutral	this webstore is one of the best , but still need to improve some problems with worldwide sells .
neutral	there are a many variaty of products , the prices is good , but the shipping method for another countrys need to be cheaper and faster .
neutral	i had one issue , they wouldn_'_t let my father - in - law get the unit as the site described i could if i included his_name .
neutral	this isn_'_t too big a deal ... except that i am now 0 days behind in my move .
neutral	so ... yeah ...
neutral	the free delivery only works if you want to wait for a long time .
neutral	due to work we are not getting our furniture for 0_weeks .
neutral	if we want it in a week or less it would cost us £_00
neutral	i was offered a free_gift of some badges .
neutral	these were funnily enough out of stock .
neutral	no alternative offered .
neutral	i was given a refund .
neutral	of nothing .
neutral	plus when my ' poster ' arrived i was surprised it was just 00x0 big .
neutral	a photo .
neutral	not a poster .
neutral	i wouldn_'_t use them again .
neutral	shipping takes_forever tried to call stay on hold_forever this is my last purchase through this merchant
neutral	look , i know you can '_t know what the insurance cost will be but you need to cover more than a 0 , 000 deductible .
neutral	in the future when i get a price on - line i will need to double your price for a comparison .
neutral	you guys do a great job with the car and customer service , work on the insurance & hidden_fees .
neutral	i liked the idea of the website , and that they sell most things a pc_gamer might need and eliminates the need to go to the store .
neutral	it is a trust_worthy site but the reason i gave it 0_stars was because of the spending_limit , it was a real inconvenience .
neutral	i understand it might be for safety purposes and used as a precaution but i would of really_liked it if that wasn_'_t in place , i do plan on buying more items but it will take me days to get everything i want because of the spending_limit .
neutral	i would travel to a store near by but i '_m on a military base with no pov , i don_'_t want to have to spend more money on a taxi .
neutral	had lots of deals with wowcher delayed and some not turned_up , had to get in touch with enquiry department on numerous_occasions , give you your due you have compensated for these delays .
neutral	despite behing a lot cheaper_than the cannon cartridges . the ink in your refills seem to run out quickly so not as good value as it first seemed
neutral	i think you guys are doing a pretty good job .
neutral	however , my last order i forgot to add one item .
neutral	i had to reorder but i asked that it be included in the prior order a few_minutes earlier .
neutral	i wanted it included in my 00_%_discount promotion_code .
neutral	it didn_'_t happen .
neutral	it would be nice if you could communicate statically to correct things .
neutral	it is possible that i am not aware of a procedure in place ?
neutral	my cat has miliary dermatitis over much of his skin .
neutral	i started vetionx 0 / 0 / 00 .
neutral	it is now 0 / 0 / 00 and there is no discernible improvement .
neutral	he is also going through a prednisone sequence and that is not helping much either .
neutral	my cat '_s situation might be beyond these medications , so i am not going to judge this product at this time .
neutral	this started with my cat in 0000 diagnosed as a spring allergy which came back in 0000 , was not a problem in 0000 or 0000 but came back very strongly in 0000 .
neutral	when the jets go bad ( break ) it " s nice to be able to replace it in a more like weeks not months .

neutral	es_la primera_vez que_lo use y me fue_muy_bueno consegui un_buen hospedaje en barcelona centrico y a buen_precio y_lo_mejor con una buena anfitriona como maría que puso su casa a nuestro disfrute .
neutral	la respuesta a la solicitud de alojamiento fue rápida y se mantuvieron en contacto a través_de_los correos recordando mis siguientes estancias .
neutral	en_la segunda reserva si tuve un_problema de cancelación del alojamiento en roma , wimdu me escribio para ponerme al tanto y tratar de solucionar inconveniente .
neutral	sólo decir a wimdu que me sirvio y_lo usare en otro viaje .
neutral	please check at the end of trad0front
neutral	it took more than 00_hrs to ship from the location .
neutral	b_&_h still beat amazon by a few_bucks , but i '_ll have to be more careful about the " free shipping " thing in the future .
neutral	mail order is always risky if you aren_'_t sure of the product .
neutral	the total of t he order including s / h was $_00 .
neutral	so no big_deal either way .
neutral	shame no card was left .
neutral	i tried 0 doors before i found out the neighbour who had taken it for me .
neutral	i tried to log in for 0 days !
neutral	i did everything to get my password reset , however the computer would not authenticate my account thus not letting_me in .
neutral	i tried several_times , with no change .
neutral	finally i called and talked to an agent .
neutral	if it weren_'_t for agent i would be a life lock customers by now !
neutral	she was so nice , polite and helpful .
neutral	the agent gets 0_stars !
neutral	!
neutral	we ordered the fuel oil on the friday and it was delivered on the tuesday following , excellent service from boiler_juice .
neutral	however as we live out in the sticks we have a standing request for a phone_call the night before to allow us to unlock gate and tank .
neutral	due to the fact that the boiler was to be serviced on the tuesday we left the gate unlocked , imagine my surprise to come home on the tuesday and find our oil had been delivered , your local_supplier did not call and as such the tank was locked , so he filled through the vent pipe , must have taken him ages .
neutral	anyway , boilerjuice well_done good service , but local_supplier , boo , you would have fopund everything locked normally because you did not call then where would we have been , waiting longer ....
neutral	astalavista amigos
neutral	pretty good company , like the price match .
neutral	shipping can be a bit much and isn_'_t all that fast .
neutral	offer free_samples but over charge for shipping on all be_careful of this .
neutral	i can find what i want at b_&_h and prices are competitive with amazon , but shipping is slow and expensive !
neutral	i have amazon_prime and get 0 day shipping on most things i buy .
neutral	wish b_&_h would have faster and cheaper shipping options and i would purchase more through them .
neutral	i '_ve been a customer of myprotein for quite a few_years_now , and up until a few_months_ago their service had been amazing .
neutral	unfortunately since what seems to have been a major expansion of their business to europe and vast more quantities of products the service has decreased in my view .
neutral	the products are still top_notch and there '_s a great choice of options to meet a wide_range of requirements but delivery times just hasn_'_t been met on atleast 0 occassions now .
neutral	since the introduction of pretty_much no choice but next_day delivery my deliveries have been late by 0 - 0 days everytime .
neutral	since i pay roughly £ 0 . 00 per delivery i don_'_t expect this .
neutral	i am a uni student and often i order before going home or back to uni , the delivery not arriving on time has often lead to me running out of shake and then ofcourse i '_m in a different town to where i asked for the items to be delivered because i had to go home or to uni !
neutral	when i emailed to complain , no compensation or even apology as far as i remember was offered .
neutral	only ' so has it arrived today then ?'
neutral	the day after .
neutral	poor service and it '_s a shame as myprotein used to be so brilliant at everything they offered .
neutral	as i said the products are still great though !
neutral	the original pair sent left lenses was incorrect an size was not correct .
neutral	after all the correspondence the second_pair corrected the vision error , but are still too narrow .
neutral	i sent dimensions and photographs and the glasses put indentions on the side of my head they are so small .
neutral	it took envirofone a week to post my cheque to me for some reason .
neutral	i find this level of service unacceptable and will not be using their services again , there are plenty of other_companies out there .
neutral	prices were okay and selection good however it has taken any where from 0 to 00 days to get parts , which is ridiculous when you are waiting to put a vehicle back together
neutral	a good company but the correspondence between them and the client is 0 / 00 ...
neutral	this has happened twice to me know and i was fed up the first time and still_haven_'_t had a response 00mths on ....
neutral	i hadn_'_t received the order after 0_weeks and after , phoning it seems that , the order , hadn_'_t been passed on to the warehouse .
neutral	the item did arrive after , that and was ok
neutral	i ordered a radiator and also separately oil_filters and the parts were quality and easy to find but got raped on shipping .
neutral	still cheaper_than the airport but be aware they cheat !
neutral	booking_fee is hidden till you are well through the booking process .
neutral	i was tempted to abandon and pay more money to the airport .
neutral	bought two pair of glasses .
neutral	one pair is a half rim pair , that i love .
neutral	the other pair are sunglasses which i hate .
neutral	the design of the sunglasses , is the worst i '_ve ever had .
neutral	worst .
neutral	there is a separate lens with the prescription , that snaps into the nose of the glasses .
neutral	the prescription lens isn_'_t wide enough and the wind_shield lens isn_'_t dark enough .
neutral	also , there is a blurry spot in either the prescription or the wind_shield that '_s unnoticed until you put them together .
neutral	would not buy this style ever again .
neutral	i had a pair of sunglasses that i bought a few_years back from global that broke .
neutral	unfortunately global doesn_'_t carry that style frame anymore .
neutral	if they did , i would have purchased another pair , as those were the best i ever had .
neutral	ever .
neutral	the carpets / drapes were filthy .
neutral	room was put_together n staff was friendly but u get what u pay for .
neutral	the beautiful lobby was so misleading .
neutral	i would recommend a better system for delivery .
neutral	per the fedex tracking , my screen sat for 0 full days at the sort facility which was 00 miles from delivery address .
neutral	the screen actually originated from an address that was closer to the delivery address than the fed_ex facility .
neutral	i would have preferred the option to pick it up myself vice paying a premium fee for it to purposely be sent further from me .
neutral	delivery was a rip_off and fedex wouldn_'_t release it to me at the facility .
neutral	they had to deliver it .
neutral	i ordered my parts , they came and were the right ones .
neutral	they were timely and the customer service was courteous .
neutral	however , during the automated check out process it notified me that i couldn_'_t ship the package to a po_box .
neutral	so with this information i choose my physical_address .
neutral	my physical_address doesn_'_t have usps delivery or any notification that a package was sent to that address .
neutral	i figured they didn_'_t us usps if they couldn_'_t ship to a po_box .
neutral	not the case .
neutral	they shipped the package with usps to a location that cannot receive usps packages .
neutral	upon_contacting the customer service i was fed the regular protocol for dealing_with this issue .
neutral	they would kindly refund my money once they were returned due to ' return to sender '.
neutral	still not an answer to my problem that shouldn_'_t have been a problem in the first place .
neutral	thanks ,
neutral	jeff t .
neutral	its ok for ebay and stuff , but i perfer other online transaction companies
neutral	kilt arrived_promptly , good quality no problem in terms of service .
neutral	what i do take offence to is the torrent of emails which has accompanied this purchase .
neutral	i received at_least 0 emails prior to the product arriving and another 0 or 0 since !
neutral	took much longer to arrive than_expected due to import paperwork not seemingly expected or organised by hudson .
neutral	also i emailed to ask about trade discount ( i '_m and architect and they are for my own home ) - you ' d think that hudson would be happy to encourage that but no .
neutral	the email was short and negative saying there was no discount available .
neutral	i went onto coupon . com and got a code for 0 %_off straight_away ??!
neutral	go figure .
neutral	i don_'_t know of any construction company that doesn_'_t offer trade discount to professionals - such a mean and ridiculous waste of time ,
neutral	when unwrapped , one of the packages didn_'_t have the nylon strapping to secure and the box was only sealed with sellotape which always makes me suspicious .
neutral	sure_enough , that radiator was damage on both_sides .
neutral	it '_s too much_trouble to return , so i '_ll repair it myself and use that one in a less obvious place .
neutral	all in all a disappointing experience .
neutral	i have done business with them for years but they do not treat men and women equally and considering the tens of thousands of dollars i have spent here over the years , that is a huge_disappointment .
neutral	the delivery of the product was good .
neutral	but i hade had a question in front of the delivery , but i didn_'_s got a answer !
neutral	so now i tried it again anh hopefully .............................
neutral	i would have edited the field containing my name had i known that the review would use my full name .
neutral	fortunately , i figured_out how to make the change for future postings , and they applied the change to my previous posts , including this one .
neutral	the price is good , and the features are sufficient compared to other service out there .
neutral	still the main issue is echoing while talking .
neutral	i like this company and it certainly has an entrepreneurial spirit .
neutral	the website is easy to navigate and the prices are good .
neutral	unfortunately my order wasn_'_t in stock , and i struggled to get a straight answer from one contact who seemed like he wasn_'_t able to communicate internally to find out what i had ordered or even who i was .
neutral	i '_ll use them again , but hope they get on track .
neutral	vos tarifs sont intéressants et_la qualité de_votre travail très acceptable .
neutral	par_contre , les délais de livraisons sont trop longs et en plus , j ' ai_eu une surtaxe douanière de 00 € à payer à_la réception de_mon colis .
neutral	service could have been better
neutral	always easy to book and efficient .
neutral	my preferred car_park provider ...
neutral	the storage_space is good for the price ... but don_'_t plan on storing anything heavy ... there are just too many stairs to drag heavy items upstairs .
neutral	happy with experience and product , but much room for improvement .
neutral	- design web - site difficult to work in , and missing some pretty important basics ( like being_able to simply duplicate front of bookmark on back )...
neutral	- finished_product ok , but some pretty shoddy quality ( like doing a better job aligning and centering photos )
neutral	in general , service was quick , but lots of room for improvement , and with some minor web - site design work and product attention to quality , could be great ...
neutral	my plastic under engine_splash guard came in with 0 tabs broken due to shipped with no packaging !
neutral	of course the small plastic tabs are going to break !
neutral	ordered 0 carhartt shirts in a color then received a call saying that color was not avalible until august .
neutral	amazon will not put order thru unless item is in stock .
neutral	purchased item that was stated online as in stock ; paid for it with credit_card .
neutral	later received an_email that the item was out of stock .
neutral	refund was fast , so no problem .
neutral	selected the hotel which posted a shuttle to and from the airport .
neutral	on arrival at the airport .
neutral	no shuttle service , checked in to the hotel shuttle service discontinued , no notice .
neutral	the quality of these fender wells is far from oem quality .
neutral	they are paper_thin and are poor fitting .
neutral	auto_europe did fine but watch out for the hertz rental office at the airport in munich .
neutral	there was an article in our local paper about a bad_experience there before we rented so we were on guard .
neutral	sure_enough when we arrived they attempted to add charges to our estimated costs that should not have been there .
neutral	when challenged the office could not explain_why they were there .
neutral	it took them over a half_hour to come up with an explanation that was not correct .
neutral	they finally agreed they should remove them .
neutral	when returning the car , again additional_charges .
neutral	this time 00 euro that the office could not justify .
neutral	again over a half_hour of " checking with my supervisor ".
neutral	this time the explanation was : we turned the car in 0 hours early !!!.
neutral	they claimed the contract through auto_europe was for 0pm to 0pm and we were turning in the car at 00am !
neutral	after being challenged repeatedly they finally said they could fix it by holding the reservation open until 0pm and the charge would go away .
neutral	fortunately we didn_'_t have a plane to catch that day or we would have had to challenge the charge on this end and probably lose
neutral	be_careful with hertz at the munich airport !!
neutral	!
neutral	the part i ordered does fit , but does not look like the oem part .
neutral	really good quality however of the three skins purchased one was a lot lighter in colour than i expected from the image seen on the website so it won_'_t suit the person i bought it for as a gift .
neutral	the other two are perfect !
neutral	!
neutral	this company needs to spend more time updating available posts
neutral	buying a toilet from victoria_plumb has_been a very frustrating and unsatisfactory experience .
neutral	the cistern came without installation_instructions , and the professional plumber who fitted it could not find a way to put it together which allowed it to flush properly .
neutral	having sent several pictures of how we had arranged it , we were finally told it had been installed correctly - after several separate email threads with different people who didn_'_t seem to be sharing notes or know what the others were saying .
neutral	they concluded the problems were with the specific item we received and offered to send a replacement cistern .
neutral	unfortunately they have none in stock and a problem with suppliers , so several weeks_later we have received nothing and no_indication of when we can expect to .
neutral	( and we still don_'_t really know if that will fix it anyway .)
neutral	in the meantime our toilet frequently needs to be flushed twice or more , and often water continues to flow through after the flush until it is flushed yet again .
neutral	we had to call several_times and make a big fuss to get taken seriously at all , and we certainly never get unsolicited updates or anything helpful like that .
neutral	product delivery was fine , but from the point that we had a problem the experience has_been rubbish .
neutral	further comment following response below from victoria_plumb :
neutral	after seeing this response from victoria_plumb ( below ) i waited for a week with no further communication from them .
neutral	then i was contacted to say that a new cistern was to be delivered in a few_days .
neutral	it arrived as_promised , and although it was not quite the same as the one i had ordered it was pretty similar .
neutral	i had it fitted , and it worked all right , although not perfectly in that the handle did not spring back up with any force , and would remain down ( with the cistern flushing ) if the seat was up and resting against it .
neutral	over the course of the next few weeks , however , this improved and now ( months later ) it works_fine .
neutral	so ultimately , although i wasn_'_t overjoyed about the whole_experience , i did end up with a toilet that was pretty_much the one i ordered and does work satisfactorily .
neutral	i order 0 different parts , which totaled $_000 . 00 with shipping .
neutral	i received an_email_stating the ups_tracking_#.
neutral	i assumed all parts were being shipped .
neutral	i then received an_email_stating i was being refunded $_000 . 00 , with no_indication of what was out of stock .
neutral	i emailed to find out what was not in stock .
neutral	i received an_email_stating that 0 items were not in stock .
neutral	when my shipment arrived , only 0 of the parts were delivered .
neutral	i then emailed to inquire why the refund was for 0 part & not 0 .
neutral	in the end i received an_email_stating 0 parts were shipped through ups ( which i received promptly ) & 0 were being shipped fedex ( again received ) & itemizing the out of stock part & amount refunded .
neutral	if the 0st email response from your company gave the info of the last email , all would have been fine .
neutral	but after wasting my time ( which included an extended period of time listening to your music on hold & never getting through ), my time researching what charges were what , & the time it took to email a few_times , your customer service definitely needs attention .
neutral	and the idea of getting a $_00 . 00 refund for ordering over b $_000 . 00 is very misleading
neutral	the shopping_experience was ok .
neutral	the information provided was pretty good .
neutral	the " empty cart " button didn_'_t work , however .
neutral	once i made it to the shopping_cart , the items in the shopping_cart didn_'_t link back to the item descriptions .
neutral	that would have been handy .
neutral	i only got a " time to ship " estimate after i placed the order .
neutral	i was surprised to get an e_-_mail message after i ordered that i would receive another e_-_mail message 00 to 00 business days_later with an estimate as to when the product would ship .
neutral	that said , the product selection , the prices , and shipping_costs are very good .
neutral	the other downside was that my credit_card was charged immediately .
neutral	the company should only charge the credit_card after the item has shipped to the customer .
neutral	at this point , they are apparently waiting on delivery from their supplier .
neutral	so i shouldn_'_t have to have it on my credit_card yet .
neutral	overall , i am optimistic that the purchase will be a positive one after i receive the product .
neutral	i haven_'_t had a website until now .
neutral	due to being very busy most of the time i don_'_t have time to update or make use of the obvious good uses it has .
neutral	i , m a ltd company but only me that runs it .
neutral	experience was alright , could ship faster though .
neutral	took a week and a half to receive the order .
neutral	[_external reference_] has a better selection and will get you your order in half the time .
neutral	thesnugg has a terrific line of products .
neutral	i ordered an ipad0 soft snugg , a hard shell ipad0 snugg and a 0 in 0 stylus writing pen on december_00th .
neutral	i received an_email later that day confirming that order .
neutral	everything looked fine .
neutral	about a week_later , i received my order .
neutral	i did receive the ipad0 case cover and flip stand in pink pu leather that i ordered .
neutral	i did not receive the 0 in stylus and writing pen nor the ipad0 premium protection hard shell case with stand .
neutral	instead , i received the stylish ipad0 case and stand and the robust and stylish case , cover and stand for the new ipad .
neutral	i don_'_t have the new ipad .
neutral	i sent an_email to snugg . com on the 00rd .
neutral	i am still_waiting for a reply .
neutral	on the 00th , i received another part of my order , the hard shell case with stand .
neutral	i am still_waiting for the 0 in 0 stylus and writing pen .
neutral	after the first email_confirming my order , snugg never sent any follow - up emails to inform_me that my order might be arriving in separate_shipments .
neutral	clean facility , nice staff , but some of the extra_charges offsets the nice price .
neutral	the e0x n00 cf airbox kit didn_'_t have holes cut out for the part of the air scoop .
neutral	we had to diy on that part which was quite an effort and a shock .
neutral	the strut bars went up perfectly .
neutral	however , the general product fit and finish was well_worth it '_s money .
neutral	last trip we arrived after making_reservations for both flight / car .
neutral	the car given was a 0 door as i thought i specifically checked off a 0 door when making_reservations .
neutral	this trip i specifically picked a 0 door , but after completing and paying the receipt indicated a 0 / 0 door .
neutral	i contacted travelocity only to be directed to thrifty and back to travelocity because thrifty said it was your promo .
neutral	i called you back and was on hold ( 00 min .
neutral	of elevator music ) while you were going to correct the situation with thrifty .
neutral	i hung_up and emailed you to get a email response that " car make and model listed under car class is not guaranteed and stated as " or similar ".
neutral	numerous options available said 0 / 0 door .
neutral	the one i picked did not say 0 / 0 , it specifically said " dodge avenger or similar , 0 adults , 0 large_suitcases , 0 doors ".
neutral	last trip we were inconvenienced by this and we will not be inconvenienced on this trip .
neutral	this is bait and switch , or at the very least deceptive and i would suspect that someone needs to correct the wording if the vehicle can be switched from a 0 to 0 door .
neutral	i do not care what the make and model is as you suggest to not being guaranteed .
neutral	i will tell you that if we do not get a 0 door on this trip , that you , travelocity and thrifty will loose all future business .
neutral	respectfully ,
neutral	mike
neutral	p . s .
neutral	other than this situation we have enjoyed the services you provide .
neutral	paid for next delivery in a thursday but didn_'_t get the racquet until the following_monday .
neutral	this was disappointing as the racquet was for my daughter who was playing in a tournament at the weekend .
neutral	next_day really should mean next_day when you ' re paying extra for it .
neutral	i ordered a part previous to this one , came incorrectly , due to my lack of knowledge .
neutral	this part came incorrect , i educated myself in order to purchase the correct part , which came identical to the first , incorrect .
neutral	i will have to return both parts .
neutral	the envelopes are great and came quickly etc .
neutral	i bought a number of envelopes as samples as i am a letterpress printer and am looking for the right envelopes for my clients projects .
neutral	one problem however , when i received the envelopes i could not see which one was which , although i sort of worked it out , i still think a slip with my order should have been inserted and the envelopes labelled somehow .
neutral	i will now make my order for a larger quantity , lets_hope i get the right one ;)
neutral	prepaying the car parking should ensure painless and quick entry and exit .
neutral	in the booking process one needs to enter the car number plate .
neutral	when arriving at the parking facilities , the number plates of the car are supposed to be read automatically and again when leaving .
neutral	since the system is supposed to know that you have prepaid , the barriers should open .
neutral	this has never worked for me .
neutral	every time , when i try to leave the car_park , i have to use the call button at the exit barrier and inform the operator that i have pre_- paid , i have to give him the number plate and the reference_number and it then takes him a minute or so to find the record and finally open the barrier for exit .
neutral	this needs to be improved
neutral	!!!
neutral	!
neutral	i called to get 0 rooms at once to try and speed up the process .
neutral	it took wayyyyyy too_long on the phone .
neutral	good way to do_buisness unfortunately the car_rental company did not supply the suv requested and i had to settle for a full size car that had almost 00k_miles on the clock
neutral	livewire for the most part does a great job designing and installing sophisticated av systems and that is it .
neutral	unfortunately there is no follow_up , no e_-_mails or newsletters of new ideas or services .
neutral	obtaining service is way more difficult ( requires talking to more than one person ) than it should be .
neutral	there needs to be periodic follow_up with customers who install high end systems .
neutral	this is my second purchase from giftcards . com .
neutral	they have been great to work with and the successful orders are fulfilled quickly and accurately .
neutral	however , they cancelled one of our orders because it did not meet the required specifications but they did not refund the purchase price of the card .
neutral	we did not receive the card but they charged us for it anyway .
neutral	when i finished my order the check out said it was ' closed ', but i was allowed to keep shopping .
neutral	at_least i still had the item in my cart when i came back the next_day - not sure what would have happened if i was on a different computer .
neutral	i am trying to return the core of a part i purchased from partsgeek and it has_been absolutely impossible as they have left no information about how to contact them in any way .
neutral	no , address , phone_number , etc .
neutral	i ordered a window_motor for my ford_f000 the part was cheap .
neutral	one thing i didn_'_t like is that i was never notified that my part was shipped .
neutral	once the part was shipped to my house i finally received a email with my tracking_number . if i didn_'_t have that issue i would be_happier with this site
neutral	good price on ray_bans but beware , they do not have the stock and order it once you pay .
neutral	mine had to come from italy .
neutral	the lady on the phone ( tasha ?
neutral	trisha ?)
neutral	was disinterested to the point of being rude .
neutral	i am happy with the translation however it might be better if you use the original document as template and then just translate .
neutral	i found a wheel for my wife '_s care after she ruined one in the millions of potholes around here .
neutral	the website said it was in stock .
neutral	i bought the wheel with a card .
neutral	i received an e_-_mail_stating the transaction was in process ...... after 0 days i receive another e_-_mail_stating they did not have it in stock and would refund me .
neutral	someone needs to do some inventory
neutral	you should have policy for cheaper or free shipping if over a certian amount .
neutral	as usual i did not get the car i ordered , i did not want an upgrade
neutral	except a compact at a lesser price .
neutral	i did not like the cosa .
neutral	it was too big and had poor visability .
neutral	i would much rather have had a polo or golf , but was told the upgrade was better .
neutral	if i ever use autoeurope again i will insist that i get the car i ordered .
neutral	i am going to pheonix mesa on oct 00th - 00th .
neutral	what can you do for me ?
neutral	p lowrie
neutral	i was going to order 00 different items during your april " free shipping " promo and right before clocking the order button , i realized that i was still being charged for shipping .
neutral	then , i went back and clicked on the details button and it mentions that basically nothing of weights ( bars , kb , med ball , etc ) are included in the promo .
neutral	why run a promo then if all items are not included ?
neutral	this product , an anti_- allergy filter , was hard to find .
neutral	i was able to find it via the internet .
neutral	there was a mistake in the delivery .
neutral	fedex resolved the problem after several days delay .
neutral	it will take some time before i will be able to assess whether the filters improve my allergy symptoms .
neutral	every time i use your website to make personalized_gift_cards ... it crashes in the middle and i lose all my work .
neutral	it happened on this order and back on september it happened when i was making 0 personalized_gift_cards ... i literally had to restart them over 0 times and something should '_ve taken 0 minutes took me over an_hour !!
neutral	will look for other_websites next time ... hopefully you can fix this glitch .
neutral	also , i felt_like i paid for the overnight shipping , a ridiculous amount and it didn_'_t get shipped out as fast as i ' d have liked .
neutral	this gift_card was for someone that just lost everything in a fire , and it took them days to get it , when i promised them they ' d have it the next_day .
neutral	the zipper mechanism on the bicycle jersey is located on the left_side of the jersey .
neutral	great for left - handers , but this is not the normal convention .
neutral	the zipper mechanism should and always be located on the right - side of the garment .
neutral	this was my only disappointment .
neutral	i don_'_t use my printer a lot .
neutral	the cartridge i put in shows only 0 / 0 full on the read - out .
neutral	i hope the reading is off due to it being a reconditioned cartridge .
neutral	prompt delivery .

neutral	dear_sir / madam ,
neutral	i received the wrong part and need to return for refund .
neutral	however , i discovered that the process for addressing the issue described on your website is flagged with an out of service message .
neutral	order : 00 00000 orig : 00000 arnold kniess received ac suction hose p / n 0000000 – wrong part .
neutral	please provide guidance on how to return –* your site indicates customer_support system is down for mx ?
neutral	the part i received has a threaded connection end and the part i needed was flanged .
neutral	i did not open the plastic_wrapping because i could see the part would not fit .
neutral	this error did result in some inconvenience as the repair was critical for the holiday .
neutral	i would appreciate your resolution to this matter .
neutral	best regards ,
neutral	arnold kniess
neutral	please reference attachments for details on this matter :
neutral	online pricing was deceptive , although they explained that they had to be deceptive because their competition is deceptive .
neutral	overall price was competitive , service was quick enough .
neutral	the package was received about 0 days after ordering , but we had to go to the post_office and pay $ 0 postage due .
neutral	i have an auto_repair_shop in new_jersey .
neutral	i ordered from partsgeek because i believed it to also be located in nj .
neutral	the parts took 0 days to arrive ( shipped from california ).
neutral	if i had known the origin i would have shipped overnight .
neutral	i wasn_'_t given an eta until the parts were shipped the following_day .
neutral	when i saw the eta of thursday , october 0rd , i ordered the clutch elsewhere and completed the job on monday , september_00th .
neutral	the customer had their vehicle back 0 days before the parts arrived from partsgeek .
neutral	order # 00 - 0000000 .
neutral	bought fog_lights as stated for 0000 equinox .
neutral	when i recieved box there were two plastic parts for each side .
neutral	no lights .
neutral	partial order as i saw it .
neutral	was expecting a total insert including light .
neutral	i did not expect the wiring_harness but the light itself and trim .
neutral	i recieved expected response on what your people said i bought .
neutral	the description of the product and light lead me to believe a total package .
neutral	this is not the end of the world but i am waiting for a return number to send back .
neutral	i now have two pay shipping and as i stated in my last e_-_mail i do not think i should pay any other charges .
neutral	i would look at your pictures and your wording to make_sure the product that i see and read about are what the customer wants .
neutral	thank - you for your time .
neutral	i am still_waiting for the info to send back .
neutral	mjb .
neutral	i like the parking_lot , its easily_accessible .
neutral	however , waiting outside 00_mins for the bus to arrives its a little too_long .
neutral	other parking lots buses were there three_times before your bus did arrives and pick me up .
neutral	also people on the phone when i called in where not too friendly .
neutral	only fast premium delivery options available made the pucrhase unneccecarily expenisve all in all .
neutral	they had the parts i needed and shipped part of the order fast , but the other part was shipped by u s mail .
neutral	even_though i was provided tracking , the mail showed it was delivered 0 days before i saw it .
neutral	do not do_business with anyone_who_uses the u s mail for any delivery !
neutral	!
neutral	well the drivers were very helpful making_sure everyone was on board and helping with directions etc .
neutral	but the whole_experience was spoiled by the criminal like activities of the scruffy , unkempt staff awaiting their victims outside tower_bridge .
neutral	their sole intent was to sell the passengers other tours and entrance tickets - many of them couldn_'_t possibly be achieved in the time available , there was a lot of cash changing hands - even the companies own drivers complained about their antics .
neutral	these_people refused to validate our on line tickets until they had finished their games , so we missed one bus .
neutral	disgraceful , and ruinous for the image of the business
neutral	envelopes arrived_promptly but rightly so , my order was only for £ 0ish and the cheapest delivery option cost £ 0 ...
neutral	when they arrived they were sent via parcelforce but for such a light package £ 0 was ridiculous .
neutral	i have ordered 0 or 0 different items from you guys .
neutral	on almost_half of them , the orders have been placed on back order .
neutral	i wish you guys would let your customers know ahead of time before they order than an item might not be available right_away .
neutral	also , i was told an item would be sent out on a specific date , only to find out that it got pushed back again .
neutral	not cool .
neutral	i have used rentalcars . com in the past and have always been extremely_satisfied .
neutral	the booking process for this trip ( to hawaii ) was no exception - until i got to the rental_desk ...
neutral	i had booked a " lock and low " deal for $_00 a day - what a great price !
neutral	since i was not familiar with what " lock and low " meant , i looked it up online prior to making the reservation .
neutral	the dollar / thrifty site indicated it meant that i would get a compact or higher level vehicle for the advertised rate .
neutral	" wow what a fantastic deal ," i though , so i booked it .
neutral	when i got to the airport rental_desk , i was told that the " lock and low " vehicle for the day was a minivan .
neutral	hmm , i have nothing against minivans , but for family of 0 without much baggage and a desire to leave a small carbon footprint , i asked the desk person if i could actually downgrade and get a compact instead .
neutral	he said - no , i could only upgrade from the minivan .
neutral	what !?
neutral	in the end , i " upgraded " to a ford_fusion and ended_up paying and extra $_00 per day ( double what i originally though i would be paying ).
neutral	next time i book with rentalcars . com , i '_m going to book the exact specification of car i want and not leave it up to chance .
neutral	the dollar / thrifty deal didn_'_t turn out to be much of a deal at all ...
neutral	i fault them for their deceptive " deals " more than i fault rentalcars . com for offering them .
neutral	although i appreciate the low_prices and the easily available price_matching before i place my order i gave it 0_stars .
neutral	i only give it 0 starts because the website is at times difficult to navigate through along with the lack of description and details on some items is frustrating .
neutral	often times making me go to competitors websites to look at product descriptions .
neutral	overall a good place to order from they just need to do some updating .
neutral	very prompt delivery of goods ordered .
neutral	arrived well_packaged and in excellent condition .
neutral	outdoor_shop kept me well informed of order and delivery status
neutral	you have way too much stuff going on all the time .
neutral	pop ups have to be closed to search what i want .
neutral	they come right back .
neutral	i may be older than some of your customers but i can '_t imagine anyone likes the flashing of pop ups all over the place .
neutral	charles alexander
neutral	individual items need a clearer description on compatability and use .
neutral	website is easy to use when you know what you need .
neutral	as a newbie i ended_up buying bits i didn_'_t need because i could not find the required information .
neutral	eg .
neutral	the difference_between a low and med cartomiser .
neutral	i liked that you could sort by price or availability , but what the site really needs is the ability to sort by proximity to a location .
neutral	i . e .
neutral	set a preferred location on a map and then sort by how close each homestay is to there .
neutral	as a visitor to a city it doesn_'_t help much to be told a suburb name , it doesn_'_t mean much , and it '_s tiring trying to google a map over and over again just to see how close each place is to your desired location .
neutral	parts shipped fast but god luck getting customer service .
neutral	you ' re screwed restock and shipping if you need to change or cancel your order for whatever_reason .
neutral	apparently this is their policy .
neutral	never was able to get to a person on the phone .
neutral	in my opinion the prices are good at the cost of customer service .
neutral	seems to be the trend i suppose .
neutral	doesn_'_t matter to most but personally i ' d pay a bit more to have customer service .
neutral	guess they are the walmart of mail order parts .
neutral	good or bad depends on what you think of zero customer service .
neutral	the parts ultimately worked but still not sure if i ' d use them again .
neutral	just my 0 cents .
neutral	its to bad you don_'_t help with shipping_charges on returns .
neutral	i tried to return a couple of headlamps but couldn_'_t because fees were $_00 for 00 lbs package .
neutral	slow to chase some cashback
neutral	regular_updates but took months from order to delivery because out of stock
neutral	spent hours trying to produce what i wanted .
neutral	made 0 picture dog tags .
neutral	website offered me 0 different shapes but would only allow one basic shape .
neutral	i would have liked the heart shape for young female puppy but no chance .
neutral	then i wanted to add coasters which were offered in the same section of the website but it set_up a completely separate basket which_meant having to place 0 orders and pay 0 delivery charges .
neutral	i wasn_'_t happy .
neutral	products have arrived and i am really pleased with them but i gave up once with the website and almost gave up a second time .
neutral	needs sorting or lose business .
neutral	i cannot say at this point that i am completely happy as of yet .
neutral	i ordered a part and the wrong part came in the box .
neutral	it cost almost $_00 . 00 to ship the part back that i only paid $_00 . 00 for shipping included .
neutral	i feel that there is ambiguity with the £ 0 next_day delivery charge . i ordered on a friday expecting delivery on the saturday .
neutral	whilst i later noticed the " end of working day " clause i feel miffed because all parcel delivery companies deliver on a saturday . my parcel was delivered the following_monday !
neutral	service was completed on the street , waiting room v small .
neutral	good prices , but had a bitch of a time trying to book online !
neutral	was slightly better once i downloaded app .
neutral	to my phone
neutral	i felt_like i spent too much money ($_00 ) for a book that was in such poor condition ( ratty , duct_tape on the binding ).
neutral	shipping and tracking_number :
neutral	when i see a item in stock online i expect it to be in stock .
neutral	customer should not have to track someone down for a tracking_number .
neutral	exhcnage or returns :
neutral	i don_'_t really like stg return exchange policy .
neutral	stg should provide return call_tag and charge the user for the return call_tag .
neutral	[_external reference_] does it and it makes things easy for the customer .
neutral	the spikes were of a high_quality , considerably better_than the cheap ones i had purchased from sports direct as a short_term replacement for a couple that had fallen out .
neutral	only issue is the poor quality of the spanner supplied - it would have been fine for putting the new spike into the boot had it not have snapped when trying to remove my old spikes .
neutral	boots fully respiked and much_better in the current soggy pitches we are playing on ...
neutral	the only reason_why i am giving selectspecs a 0_star is because i was satisfied with my first pair of designer glasses that i have purchased and received in march_0000 .
neutral	that , i would give a 0_star_rating even for the long wait , but not this time .
neutral	i have made another order recently , maybe about a a month and a half ago , and they sent me an_email_saying it was shipped on oct . 00 , and that i would receive my specs in 0 - 00 business days .
neutral	ok , i wait patiently for 0 , no , 00 days .
neutral	still no specs , so i email the support people and kept getting the same responses .
neutral	after over 00 days , i have yet to receive anything and the responses are always the same .
neutral	it '_s funny because i '_m ordering a budget pair of glasses so it should be done and shipped earlier , but even the designer pair arrived in a shorter period in time .
neutral	unsure if i will even receive my pair of glasses at all because i '_ll have to call my credit_card company to get my refund for a small_amount ...
neutral	waiting on phone_call from mike or mark on a resolution .
neutral	i buy a lot of wine online from eight or nine different places and use wine - searcher regularly to hunt down bottles that i '_m looking for .
neutral	that said , saratoga needs to brush up in two areas -- i never received an order confirmation and when i received a shipping confirmation it was very confusing .
neutral	it actually looked like the wine wasn_'_t in stock .
neutral	from a shopping_experience perspective , the site interface is well below the quality of other_sites .
neutral	wine arrived in a timely_fashion and that aspect was perfectly fine .
neutral	had to be contacted by administrator as time offered for tyre_fitting at garage didn_'_t take into account time to get tyres delivered there .
neutral	why allow a time / date to be picked if is outside that garage '_s scope ?
neutral	it all happened when it should just a lot of fuss about when tyres were likely to arrive
neutral	spent $ 0 . 00 on shipping and it is going to take nearly 0_weeks for product to arrive , ill think_twice before using this company again
neutral	the part that i ordered had a different connection that had to be cut , and molded to fit the application that i had bought it for .
neutral	i did not want to send the part back and i am not even sure it is connected because of the different connection than what it should be .
neutral	the part was a secondary water_pump for a 0000_vw_passat vr0 .
neutral	bosch secondary water_pump .
neutral	$_00 . 00
neutral	efficient and friendly customer service
neutral	however they only delivered half of my order
neutral	i had to go an collect the rest .
neutral	disappointed by this
neutral	good prices though .
neutral	i '_m sure it was just a blip ... wont put be off ordering again .
neutral	usually i get parts from china more fast than this store , but anyway has good prices .
neutral	i called a lot of internet european auto_parts suppliers looking for a electric engine fan for my bmw 0000 000xi t . could not find a vdo or behr in stock .
neutral	found your company and your person jessie told me dorman auxiliary fan_assembly ( 00000 -_00000000 ) was in stock in san_diego and would ship that day an would get it by friday 0 / 0 .
neutral	it came from somewhere east and did not get it until 0 / 00 .
neutral	i called endlessly to speak to someone and would get music until i was cut_off .
neutral	i spoke to rob and he gave_me the date and i checked my tracking e_-_mail and you had my e_-_mail address wrong .
neutral	i put in in yesterday and had some problems with the thickness on the plastic case on the lower left_hand area where the shroud slides between the radiator and the attached cooler assembly .
neutral	i was afraid to force it and break the bmw cooler block .
neutral	i took it back out and measured the thickness against by bad bmw part .
neutral	the dorman was 0 / 0 inch thicker in that area and that was the problem .
neutral	i filed a bevel on the leading edge and put assembly grease on contact areas .
neutral	it still took a small pry bar to get it started and then i could push it down into place .
neutral	the fan works .
neutral	one other disappointment is it was not made in the usa as jessie told me .
neutral	he even put me on hold to find out .
neutral	it was made in taiwan .
neutral	the next time i need parts , i will remember the incorrect information , the incorrect delivery date quoted , my incorrect e_-_mail address , and the incorrect origin of manufacture .
neutral	with all of that , the part did not fit like a direct replacement with out some modification .
neutral	i guess it is true that you get what you pay for .
neutral	at_least it works for now ..... but the hot summer is around the corner .
neutral	there products are cheap but there shipping and handeling is outrageous i have apo address and bodybuilding . com will ship here for about 0 00 bucks no matter_how much you order .
neutral	these_guys charged me between 00 and 00 bucks for a few items
neutral	everything was fine until i arrived at the warehouse in leigh to pick_up the shower cubicle .
neutral	after half an_hour waiting - and i had been looking at the goods for 00_minutes , i challenged one of the warehousemen as to why i was still_waiting .
neutral	he said it was because they were busy - unpacking and checking goods with customers !
neutral	since my goods were not being unpacked and checked i could have been in and out straight_away .
neutral	totally_unacceptable , the system needs a review .
neutral	customers should not be waiting while the men pack away unwanted goods .
neutral	his cabin_filter is worth what i paid for it .
neutral	the radiator i ordered fitted my ranger truck .
neutral	i got it in a reasonable time .
neutral	i wanted to add a thermostat to my order after it was placed online but no one would answer the phone there so i just picked one up at advance .
neutral	the price was pretty good .
neutral	i am happy overall .
neutral	when i rented my first car in johannesbourg , i was asked by thrifty to sign for a refundable deposit of 0000 rand ( some 000 €).
neutral	i expected to have this amount re - credited immediately after car return and check that no damage occurred and gas_tank was full .
neutral	instead , when i returned the car i was told the amount would be credited after few ( how many ?)
neutral	days .
neutral	arrived in cape_town i rented a car from budget and i was asked to sign for a refundable deposit of 0000 rand ( some 000 €), so my credit_card was charged in total 0000 €.
neutral	for car_rental deposit , limiting for some days my cash capability .
neutral	having problems in looking at my bank_account from remote , 0 days after my 0nd car return i still don_'_t know what was actually charged to my credit car .
neutral	in may opinion car_rental_companies should give the opportunity to the client to know immediately at return what will be charged , to the cost of waiting an acceptable amount of time for the car check .
neutral	economy_car should give details of the return_policy of the rental_car companies .
neutral	de reservering verliep soepel , echter kregen we op_het vliegveld van aankomst pas te horen , dat_het hotel was overboekt en_dat we overgeboekt waren naar_een , ander hotel , echter wel in een ander dorpje .
neutral	achteraf was het allemaal niet verkeerd maar hadden graag van te voren op_de hoogte gesteld geweest .
neutral	my order was split between 0 warehouses .
neutral	the first warehouse to respond had three items to ship and even_though they prepared the order quickly it was slow to ship and was delivered last .
neutral	the other part of the order had only one item and i did not receive confirmation as quickly , but this item was received first .
neutral	both warehouses shipped by ups so i believe the items in warehouse 0 were not shipped immediately .
neutral	also , because the 0 item was only stocked at and had to ship from warehouse # 0 , while all of the items from warehouse 0 qualified for free shipping , due to cost , i had to pay freight on the single item from the second warehouse .
neutral	only one vehicle available for drop_off and pick_up , so be ready to wait for up to 00_minutes either way , more during busy times .
neutral	reidy_'_s helped_me efficiently to select and arrange delivery of my keyboard , but obviously didn_'_t check the contents before delivery .
neutral	promised to send the manual on but i '_m still_waiting .
neutral	i bought the clutch_kit , the ad said to purchase the install tool separate .
neutral	very clearly in bold red letters .
neutral	so i did for an_additional_fee .
neutral	in the package of the clutch_kit there was the install tool .
neutral	so now i have a second install tool and would have to pay shipping for a return .
neutral	mathematically i lose money .
neutral	besides a car was parked behind the car i just purchased , my car wasn_'_t pressure washed as being told until i requested , and also i was told that they would fill my gas_tank , everything else went well .
neutral	i had to send 0 part back for refund , haven_'_t got refund yet .
neutral	and your comp has no phone # to speak with costumer service .
neutral	your prices are good .
neutral	when there is a problem i would like to speak with a person ,
neutral	shiping took to long time a back yard mechanic might be able to wait for parts but not a business .
neutral	so i made two orders this week , one from supplement_warehouse and one from allstarhealth .
neutral	alstarheath shipped two_days sooner even_though i ordered from both on the same day .
neutral	allstarheath is always cheaper , sw does have the price match but that is more than compensated for by allstars flat_rate shipping ( 0 . 00 ).
neutral	sw shipping is outrageous and and they have this gimmick that if you buy this or that then shipping is free for the entire order until you read the fine_print and its really only up to a certain_amount .
neutral	i do like the free stuff at sw but again its not really free , you will notice the shipping goes up for ever ' free ' item you add .
neutral	it is alittle confusing over which " policy "- park and ride , etc - u have as to arriving back at htw .
neutral	the wording seems to be a " catch - all " for policies leaving me unsure at this point where i collect my car on my return . at the airport or back at the hotel drop_off .
neutral	john
neutral	this site fulfills its obligation as far as parts are concerned .
neutral	but just try tracing your shipment !
neutral	the promise they make about being_able to trace is an_absolute bullshit deal .
neutral	disapointed when purchase was delivered to find that the item was not of a high chrome_finish , as the original internal finish from neff is .
neutral	also that another returned item was charged at 00_% of purchase price , just to have it placed back on the shelf .
neutral	great selection , especially with stuff not avail in the us .
neutral	only issue was that my cc company saw the first attempt as a possible fraudulent charge .
neutral	once part ordered & delivery was excellent .
neutral	the process to order the part was painfull .
neutral	i would send an_email to support it would take at_least 00hrs for an answer that wasn_'_t complete .
neutral	so had to send another email wait min 00_hrs for for another incomplete an inifective answer .
neutral	after 0 days and demanding i would like to speak to someone i finally received another email with the correct information .
neutral	after that everything when smooth .
neutral	i would use them again .
neutral	i '_ll let you know when they finally contact me about a faulty part that needs to be returned to them and credit my card .
neutral	the other parts i received where on time and work good so_far .
neutral	excellent product , quickly sent , but expensive postage .
neutral	planned and booked a vacation to hawaii ( my wife " s dream destination ) through travelocity .
neutral	we surfed through the site and planned our entire trip in one evening .
neutral	we had certain attractions that we knew we wanted to do , but the site also provided entertainment that we were unaware of .
neutral	only gave 0_stars because we have yet to take the trip .
neutral	skype is still the best option for overseas calling however they continue to struggle with consistent audio and video feeds .
neutral	you would think by now they would have figured it out .
neutral	the flush mount chandelier was a cut down version of the the full empire .
neutral	lots of left over crystals , and pieces .
neutral	it didn_'_t make_sense to do it that way to us - but more_importantly it should have been noted in the description that the purchaser needs to self modify the product .
neutral	with jalbum it is possible to create good album in few steps , but isn_'_t possible to add text pages .
neutral	to insert text or other elements it needs to modify html , it is not so friendly , i '_m able to do this , but i dont like waste time in these operations .
neutral	overall my experience was mixed as my order had to be cancelled as the flowers i wanted could not be supplied .
neutral	the website was easy to navigate but could give a better link to follow order progress .
neutral	it took me to call to find out could not fulfill my order !
neutral	customer_support staff were very helpful and tried to source an_alternative before agreeing to cancel order
neutral	i would try and use you again
neutral	you will need to try a couple of different cards to make the purchase .
neutral	i myself tried 0 different ones before successfully buying .
neutral	other than part of the experience which was the most time_consuming taking over an_hour to figure_out how to make it work .
neutral	received parts 00 / 00 / 00 , order #_0000000 , want to return as other item ordered is what i needed .
neutral	put in support_ticket on 00 / 00 / 00 to get rma , said i would receive rma_# within 00_hours .
neutral	did not get it .
neutral	put in another support_ticket 00 / 00 / 00 .
neutral	received same message , said i would receive rma within 00_hours .
neutral	today , 00 / 0 / 00 , still no rma_# to return the part .
neutral	tried_calling , message said for returns , go to web_site and put in a support_ticket to get an_rma_# to return an item .
neutral	what else do i need to do to get the rma_# to return the part before the 00 day return_policy is over ?
neutral	when we went to collect our hire car in london we had to pay an_additional 00 ukpounds for an_additional driver even_though we showed avis our contract provided by driveway that said second driver included in price they quoted us in australia .
neutral	prior to leaving australia i had spoken to driveway in sydney on the phone and they assured me this was correct .
neutral	it was the only reason i decided to book with them .
neutral	avis in london said that they have advised driveaway in australia that they won_'_t accept 0 nd driver at no charge and have had multiple problems with this happening .
neutral	i will be contacting consumer affairs on my return to discuss with them .
neutral	i feel i was intentionally mislead over this charge and if in the meantime driveaway found that we would have to pay for 0nd driver , then i should have been contacted prior to my departure .
neutral	won_'_t be using driveaway again .
neutral	online booking experience is always good with ebookers .
neutral	but we had to change just a name since my daughter changed her boyfriend .
neutral	and the trip is still four months away .
neutral	couldn_'_t do a change of the name online so had to call .
neutral	excellent service - but even_though we had booked for a travel_insurance , we lost 000 swiss_francs from the flight , we only got some taxes ( sfr 00 ) back ... that '_s really very expensive and makes the travel_insurance look even worse .
neutral	why having an insurance and paying for it when it doesn_'_t help at all ...
neutral	?!
neutral	not good .
neutral	i got what looks_like should be a perfectly functional part and received it promptly .
neutral	the ad gave the impression that it would solicit me for the car color and would match that but it became clear that was not to be .
neutral	no response from solicitation for info about that .
neutral	i thought it sounded tgtbt .
neutral	in any case i would still order from you again and it is certainly possible i read more into the ad than was implied .
neutral	making_reservations online and by phone was great .
neutral	but upon_arriving to check in the woman at the desk made me wait while she was going from computer to computer while she was helping another girl fill_out a job application .
neutral	i did not appreciate having to wait after driving 0 and 0 / 0 hours to get there .
neutral	at 0 : 00 am on monday when i went the desk to check out there was no one to be found at the desk nor no where in the lobby area even after ringing the night bell .
neutral	so i could not get a copy of my billing .
neutral	i as not informed if wifi was available for my use .
neutral	i would not recommend courtyard st . louis downtown to anyone .
neutral	i paid an extra $_00 for 0 - day delivery but the product arrived late ( 0 days ).
neutral	this resulted_in an embarrassing episode for my wife regarding diapers .
neutral	i have used bj once before and was very impresed with the service i recieved .
neutral	my second order which has just been delivered was not quite as pleasing .
neutral	the thing that bothered me was the very short time allowed for other orders in my postcode area to be placed , compared to the delivery time of the oil .
neutral	a mere 00hrs was allowed for other orders to be placed but i had to wait 00days for the oil to be delivered .
neutral	why couldn_'_t the order with bj be held for a longer period ?
neutral	surely that is the main selling_point of a service such as this ?
neutral	00 / 00 as to whether i '_ll order through bj next time .
neutral	i understand that the first shipment is just a basic sample , but i was a little disappointed .
neutral	i thought the products were going to be of higher quality , for instance the toys my cat destroyed in two minutes .
neutral	i '_m going to wait for the next shipment and see if it gets better .
neutral	although i have had no trouble with any of my previous_orders except for the exorbitant pricing for ball_marker magnets .
neutral	i was fortunate_enough to go to the master '_s this year and was in shock as to how much you are charging for the shirts and hats .
neutral	pricing is almost double which now makes me wonder what other items i should be checking before i order anything_else .
neutral	thank_you !
neutral	!
neutral	i bought a part on parts_geek .
neutral	it stated it fit a 0000_chevy equinox .
neutral	the part i received did not fit my vehicle .
neutral	overall the return process seems fairly easy , however i hate not being_able to talk to someone direct .
neutral	i understand this is the wave of the new era but its not my thing .
neutral	i am also not thrilled about having to pay shipping on a part that was improperly listed .
neutral	i believe the aftermarket egr_valve would fit a aftermarket egr exhaust tube but not the standard tube with the vehicle .
neutral	it is what it is .
neutral	if i ue partsgeek again i will do more research before i purchase .
neutral	the parts are cheap i like that aspect .
neutral	i most_likely though will just use napa for most of my auto needs .
neutral	i am a first time buyer so i did not know what to expect with mail order glasses .
neutral	when they arrived and i saw the glasses and tried them on i was very happy with the correction and the fit .
neutral	even got a case with cleaning_cloth .
neutral	my only_complaint was the glasses were ordered on 0 / 00 and i did not get them until 0 / 0 .
neutral	for some reason there was almost a week delay in shipping them .
neutral	this was a bit frustrating seeing as my credit_card was charged even_though the glasses did not ship for a week .
neutral	i would recommend global_eyeglasses even_though i had a shipping issue .
neutral	they had the best price i could find for the wheel_hub_assembly i bought , but it took over a week to get it .
neutral	i bought the same part from auto_parts warehouse and received it in 0 days .
neutral	i did pay several dollars more , but it was nice to get it so quickly .
neutral	so , it depends on whether you want it soon or want the best price .
neutral	i sent my phone ( broken power_button ) to i - phone surgery on the recommendation of a friend , he had received very quick service .
neutral	i sent it on monday , got an_email from them on tuesday saying they had received it .
neutral	i was expecting a quick_turnaround as mentioned on their website .
neutral	i had heard_nothing from them by thursday , so i emailed them through the contact form on the website .
neutral	no reply .
neutral	i called and was told the part was out of stock , it would be in on friday so i would receive the phone on saturday .
neutral	saturday came and went , no phone .
neutral	i called again on monday , the parts were now in .
neutral	i received the phone back on tuesday , eight days after i sent it .
neutral	now that '_s not terrible , but nowhere_near the 00 hour turnaround i was expecting , and i was kept in the dark the whole time - i had to chase to get any info , and was given the wrong info when i did .
neutral	no_indication on the website that the part was out of stock when i booked the repair .
neutral	on the plus side , they did refund my ' queue jump ' fee that i had paid .
neutral	some prices are low , but not all , some are just outragous .
neutral	depends what you buy .
neutral	shipping_costs are super high which offsets there " low_prices " so you really need a calculator handy before you click order .
neutral	for me , reviews are the most_important_thing about picking a hostel , and hostelworld reviews are useful ( obviously taken with salt ).
neutral	but for booking process there are some minor hiccups : the payment process never works in my firefox for some reason and so i have to use a different browser .
neutral	also , the map & directions page is not remembered if you quit the browser then re - open it without internet access ( e . g .
neutral	when you ' re lost on the way to the hostel ) - this is the only website i '_ve_seen that has this problem .
neutral	i have a ( free ) gold_card so i don_'_t have to pay the service charge - just the 00_% commission .
neutral	if they made me pay the service charge i ' d just use hostelbookers instead ( which just takes the 00_% commission ).
neutral	as usual , " cancellation protection " is a crock - read its fine_print !
neutral	i once emailed them for support , and never received a reply .
neutral	had to follow_up to see if my order was even going to ship , which was over a week late .
neutral	then the auto - reorder date was queued off the original date .
neutral	ultimately it all worked out and rescheduling the reorder was a breeze .
neutral	my dog is picky on eating ' old ' food , so i '_m sensitive in regards to timing !
neutral	not my 0st purchase from partsgeek - delivery notice is never sent as email claims it will be - dont have a clue when items are shipped an d no_idea about when the delivery date is - dont send me email claiming i will be notifyed when shipped - that is bull
neutral	staff in bologna airport were reasonably pleasant but we got a shock when we were asked for 000_euros extra because we booked by debit_card this should be explained before booking we didnt get a ford_focus as requested the car we recieved was a bit crammped for 0 teenagers in the back not sure if we will use gold cars again
neutral	i reserve my flights with us often and travel .
neutral	too bad i could not take up the offer despite my expenditure .
neutral	i then wrote an_email réclammation , but have received no response .
neutral	i ordered from parts_geek because it was the only site offering a color matched green door_handle with no key hole .
neutral	i was happy to find the price , but when the package arrived it was matte black just like other_sites offered for the same price .
neutral	if your vehicle happens to be matte black or you don_'_t mind a two tone vehicle ... go for it !
neutral	if you absolutely have to have a color match for your vehicle go for $_000 toyota parts or have a body shop color match the handle .
neutral	for me i am going to reach out to parts_geek and see if they just messed_up my order or if i need to send it back .
neutral	my wife doesn_'_t mind either way ... i '_ll probably end up installing it ... happy hunting .
neutral	i like the price on parts but the confirmation and bill of lading information are hard to match .
neutral	you do not provide a detail list of what was ordered in the order confirmation page and the order number is not on the bill of lading to match the order number .
neutral	also if there is an issue / question you only accept one email per person ?
neutral	this was a very easy way to get the part i needed and the only_complaint that i have was not given the option to have product sent by air .
neutral	if that option was there i did not see it or its not visable enough to add to cart .
neutral	but the part was the right one and worked great .
neutral	when we were on the first bus of the day , it was great .
neutral	but any bus after noon ( two_days in a row during fall term break ), the buses were very overcrowded .
neutral	we saw two of the competitor bus lines for every bigbus that came through .
neutral	we also spent over ten_minutes waiting at one stop when the bus driver had to explain how everything worked and accept payment from someone at one of the stops ( because bigbus did not have a representative waiting outside ).
neutral	other than that , the buses were clean and the " half open " upper deck was great .
neutral	the canned music was way too repetitive .
neutral	rebtel is likely and user_friendly . its app on windows is powerfull but moblie app some times can not cross the web filtering on some cauntry .
neutral	i am using it for more 00_% of international call
neutral	when i received my headlamp_assembly for my 0000_tundra it needed a little adjustment .
neutral	i actually had to remove the attaching arm from my old headlight and use it on the new one .
neutral	it seems that the attachment screw system was stripped and the plastic nut was broken .
neutral	not problem though as the old attachment arm worked out well .
neutral	i didn_'_t have this problem with the driver_side headlamp as it fit_perfectly .
neutral	when i made my order is stated fhat the gasket_set came with it . when i recived my order
neutral	no gasket_set .. so the local part store had one for 00 dollars so i got it from them to avoid waiting . besides that i was totally happy with service .
neutral	kirk franklin
neutral	although the service was very convenient , the price was just too high .
neutral	when i opened the package it was poorly_packed ie no packing_materials around product , box badly_damaged but no apparent damage to items .
neutral	the instructions in the box were for a different product and i had to phone for the correct ones to be emailed to me .
neutral	the bunching on the inlet pipes make it extremely difficult to connect the fittings .
neutral	i await my kitchen fitters response to assembling this in the next few_days .
neutral	says it all in the title
neutral	why worry when your clubs are still in your office a 0 : 00_pm and you close at 0 : 00 and shipsticks tells you between_0am and 0pm for pickup .
neutral	when i say we won_'_t be here and the representative at shipsticks says leave them outside the door .
neutral	your clubs maybe but not mine .
neutral	so i call ups and arrange for them to come before 0 : 00 .
neutral	isn_'_t that your job ?
neutral	well they got there and back so i guess i shouldn_'_t complain right ?
neutral	i ordered four struts and three of them came right_away with one shipper .
neutral	when i went to get them installed i found that i only had three of them ( i thought the larger heavier box_contained both rear_struts ).
neutral	the next_day the other strut showed_up via a different shipper ..... why do would you do that ?
neutral	since my mechanic isn_'_t close to home this proved to be a significant inconvenience .
neutral	the bully_sticks i bought were overpriced even at a supposed big discount .
neutral	the bus_tours are pretty great ; except why require passengers to print out actual tickets when we live in a world almost entirely ruled by smart devices ?
neutral	step up and make it easier on everyone ( especially tourists who generally don_'_t have access to printers ) and go digital .
neutral	product was as_described but there was a core_charge and instead of sending it with the part i had to contact their customer_support via_email and wait another 0 days for my return_label .
neutral	i have ordered from them many_times .
neutral	i have never had a problem .
neutral	i once ordered an adapter for my 0g iphone .
neutral	it didn_'_t work for the 0g .
neutral	they refunded my money , no questions_asked , and didn_'_t need me to ship anything back !
neutral	my fiancee loved the flowers i sent her from this website and from the picture she sent me on them it '_s seems like there was no_issues with my order .
neutral	beautiful_flowers at an affordable price .
neutral	the only_thing was everything else that was supposed to come with it , the card i typed electronically on there website was rewritten so terribly that my fiancee couldn_'_t read it ..
neutral	missing words ( mind you you can only use 000 letters ), messed_up punctuations and terrible handwriting .. also , the vase and teddy_bear i ordered along the flowers were missing ..
neutral	you can '_t beat the prices here and the shipping speed is great .
neutral	however , no one will answer the phone at customer service so don_'_t bother calling .
neutral	0 day wait for a response to an e_-_mail and then the reply only partially addressed my concern .
neutral	also , all my packages arrived damaged both inside and out .
neutral	missing or damaged product cartons inside the shipping container .
neutral	one product i recieved had been removed from the original carton and as such had no product code on it .
neutral	therefore , i cannot verify it is a new part .
neutral	they need to spend a little more effort in making_sure the product is protected instead of just throwing stuff in a carton .
neutral	also they charged my credit_card a full week before all the products shipped .
neutral	this is unethical but i did eventually get everything .
neutral	bought an 0ft x 00ft oval extreme trampoline .
neutral	once i realised that the parts were labelled up wrong the trampoline went together easily although the instructions could be clearer with better pictures .
neutral	it all seems very sturdy and good for both children and adults alike with a great bounce but need to be_careful that the legs are at 00_degrees to the frame - perhaps a bolt through the top of the legs would be a really good addition to ensure this will always be the case ?
neutral	needed an oval trampoline for our small garden and only had it a few_days so interested to see how it lasts but so_far so good and would recommend it .
neutral	going to look for a skirt to fit an oval trampoline as this would be useful to stop the dog getting under it when the children '_s are using it .
neutral	the kids have been on the trampoline all bank_holiday_weekend and had a great time .
neutral	the trampoline itself is fantastic and very solid with a great bounce but the net surround is not great and still have concerns about the legs being_able to move .
neutral	the net surround is tied in lots of places at the bottom but at the top there is just one tie to the top of the poles to the plastic_cover that are not bolted together and there is a lot of give in it .
neutral	hope it lasts and will provide suitable protection to my 0 and 0 year_old over time .
neutral	i received my part in the time frame i was promised .
neutral	so_far it apears to be a good buy for my money .
neutral	the only problem ihave is the part was damaged .
neutral	when igot the box one corner of the product was sticking out of the box .
neutral	there was a 0 / 0 inch piece of the plastic missing off the mirrow .
neutral	i looked in the bag andcould not find the piece .
neutral	i work in amanufacturing plant and sometimes on a packing line .
neutral	my opinion is you need more protection than just a bag .
neutral	the pharma gaba i got from you doesn_'_t work for me in any dosage but i liked the service so will consider pureformulas in the future .
neutral	i correctly ordered two parts from the website .
neutral	one of the parts was wrong and it was clear that partsgeeks stock was mis_- labeled , part numbers crossed incorrectly .
neutral	i asked for return and refund .
neutral	no attempt was made to ship the correct item or correct the error .
neutral	i will buy the part from another_vendor who has the correct part .
neutral	my bridge is extremely loose and i don_'_t think your software for the picture i took is very accurate
neutral	i loved all the things we saw in london .
neutral	however the lunch was not authentic english faire as_advertized .
neutral	it was cafateria fish and chips .
neutral	the guide had good knowledge and helped_us see a lot .
neutral	once on the thames curse we felt lost and had to guess when we should get off .
neutral	after i ordered the part , i figured_out that i was not capable of replacing it myself .
neutral	i have been trying to get a rma_# and i '_m not getting any response .
neutral	i ordered two jackets on 00th_april and was informed of 00 day delay which actually became 0_weeks .
neutral	when the order did arrive it was perfect , so i have ordered again to be told it will be 00 day delay on these also . just hoping that is all it is as i go on holiday in 00 days .
neutral	tracking my order there was a considerable delay !
neutral	i have never experienced such delays with my considerable online purchases this season !
neutral	i have bought before from merlin and have no_complaints .
neutral	ups are a really bad delivery service .
neutral	if you are working ( and most people with the money to buy stuff are ) they will not leave items at your door ( nobody steals stuff from your door round here ).
neutral	you end up having to pick_up from their depot which in my area is a 00 mile_round_trip .
neutral	on the other hand royal_mail will leave items at the local post_office ( 0 miles_away ) - or even take them to your work address - because round here the postman knows where most people work .
neutral	merlin , please stop using ups or i '_ll have to stop buying stuff from you
neutral	getting the policy was easy , but the e_-_mail confirmation that was meant to give me access to my insurance documents wasn_'_t very good - in fact it had no content !
neutral	ugh !
neutral	!
neutral	there is not enough variety and not enough savings .
neutral	pleased with the parts shame they took so long to arrive i had to re arrange the plumber waiting for the parts to come
neutral	i would love to review the protein , but alas it has yet to arrive , waiting over a week now and still no sign :-(
neutral	i originally placed this order without_any problem .
neutral	however when the order was shipped it was shipped via_ups to my billing_address , which is a p . o .
neutral	box .
neutral	whether it was through error of mine or not , supplementwarehouse . com never made an attempt to contact me to ask for a different shipping address .
neutral	they shipped my order to my p . o .
neutral	box , knowing that ups doesn_'_t ship to p . o .
neutral	boxes .
neutral	the day of delivery , i don_'_t know how or why , someone , i don_'_t know who , made the decision that since they couldn_'_t ship to my p . o .
neutral	box , instead of shipping back to the supplementwarehouse . com , they decided to ship to my old address , where i no_longer resided .
neutral	when i contacted supplementwarehouse . com , i spoke with lisa courtney , who had no_clue what was going on , but offered to re - ship my order .
neutral	granted , this all took_forever , and i was not pleased with the fact that my order got lost , lisa , did come through and even substituted 0 00 servings of xtend because the flavor i wanted was out in the 00 servings container .
neutral	i was a little unimpressed with the fact that my order was not express shipped due to the error , but i guess the free shake cup makes up for it .
neutral	i wasn_'_t pleased with the experience , and i don_'_t know if i '_ll order from them again , but i give credit to lisa and her customer service for getting things done , despite numerous roadblocks .
neutral	i did not look at any reviews before i ordered my part .
neutral	i would not have ordered from them if i knew that you could only talk to them through a support_ticket , in which they say they will respond within 00 - 00_hrs .
neutral	i own a automotive repair_shop and do not have time to wait on parts i probably will not buy from them anymore .
neutral	if they can fix this problem then i will keep buying parts from them .
neutral	this was my first order from them , so it should have been delivered right .
neutral	on time but missing parts .
neutral	the parts that i ordered took to long to get to me , about 00 days .
neutral	i had to buy the parts locally , now the parts that i recieved from you i have to take a loss .
neutral	because i can not do any thing with these parts .
neutral	carlos
neutral	hello -
neutral	i have logged on twice , once successfully .
neutral	the one time i got on did enjoy seeing my credit rating right_away but was puzzled by the price listing for credit_reports .
neutral	i was under the impression they were included .
neutral	today i tried to log on for the second time ever , obviously it ’_s hard for me to find the time , but there is an erroneous credit matter i ’ m trying to get fixed .
neutral	the message was the system is unavailable sorr for the inconvenience .
neutral	regards ,
neutral	j
neutral	a text was sent to say we would receive our delivery on a specific date , but no delivery arrived .
neutral	i had to contact the oil company who said it was due to bad_weather , which was fair enough .
neutral	i asked for another text to be sent before the delivery again .
neutral	none arrived , but i had the foresight to unlock the tank as there was only one day of the delivery schedule left .
neutral	the delivery did arrive and thankfully i had unlocked the tank , but there was no text to advise us of this .
neutral	would give boiler_juice a second go though as savings on the price of oil do make a difference .
neutral	good company and they had my hard to find part , but the shipping options are just one fedex and they failed to deliver the part because they could '_t find my address .
neutral	fedex had to deliver it to their pickup_location then i had to pick it up .
neutral	i will order again only if they give me more than one shipping option .
neutral	you can make things a little easier by changing format of registration .
neutral	i submitted a request for rma , included order #.
neutral	four days_later get an_email from returns_dept asking for order #, what parts being returned , reason for return .
neutral	replied to this , get another email noting that i replied .
neutral	got another email_telling_me to wait again for the rma .
neutral	this is ridiculous , seems like these_people are asleep or something .
neutral	still_waiting , probably should have called in the first place .
neutral	travelocity recently changed its website .
neutral	the new website is counter intuitive as it allowed_me to purchase an airline ticket without my profile information .
neutral	this prevented me from being_able to use my frequent_flyer account or from tracking my trip using my travelocity profile .
neutral	furthermore , the new site no_longer offers me the option of looking at varied departure and arrival dates , plus or minus three_days from my desired travel date .
neutral	this would have provided me more options in picking my best flight .
neutral	on the way out it was a seamless experience .
neutral	however , on return i was unable to contact anyone for over 00_minutes .
neutral	i called all 0 numbers on the booking email to no_avail .
neutral	in the end i had to call the main 0000 number before i finally got though to someone .
neutral	after which i was told i ' d have to wait 00 - 00_mins .
neutral	i actually waited closer to 00_mins .
neutral	not great ...
neutral	while they may be one of the cheaper agents if you have a question you may have trouble getting through .
neutral	i found the phone line 00_% of the time didn_'_t even ring - rather a nasty ( disconnected ) tone instead .
neutral	perhaps it is phoning some far off land like hong_kong where the headoffice is ?
neutral	when i did get through , whichever option i chose had a lengthy_delay before anyone picked_up - which only happened once !
neutral	i also find it annoying that there is no room description whatsoever , so i don_'_t know if i ordered a pokey room when £_00 more might have ordered a large classy room ?
neutral	?
neutral	they shipped me the wrong item so i emailed customer service and cc ' d sales just to make_sure and after 0 days no one had responded .
neutral	i called them and got immediate help with them shipping the correct part out with a return_label for the wrong stuff .
neutral	great help on the phone but they need lots of work on their email support .
neutral	i like the website , i love the prices and the different available parts and manufacturer choices of parts .
neutral	i have one complaint and that is to be able to have available shipping options for each part overnight .
neutral	also i would like to see actual realtime inventory of parts available in hand .
neutral	not what is supposed to be there and find out after ordering that you are out of stock of product after making order for overnight .
neutral	to find you have to wait 0 more days before your overnight shipment wont arrive till a week_later .
neutral	i purchesed a wheel_hub for my truck and the part did not fit so i contacted the return department and they set_up the return with a note_saying that they would be happy to assist me in ordering the right part i gave them the info make model and year and they said i needed the part that i ordered ( the wrong part ) in other_words the web_site is wrong i ordered what the web_site said i needed and the part did not fit so i '_m $_00 . 00 in the hole to return the part .
neutral	i did do my home work and ordered the right part from parts_geek but that was before i did the $_00 . 00 return
neutral	my artwork was confussed with someone_elses and when i told them the problem it took a long time before they fixed it and got it back to me .
neutral	shaking my head .
neutral	cmon people get with it !
neutral	i know you can do better !!
neutral	your product rocks !
neutral	ordered products and after one month of waiting contacted them about when my products would be sent to me .
neutral	after being told the products where being sent i received a second email 0 days_later to be told it had now been sent .
neutral	not impressed with the service .
neutral	i ordered a part that was listed on the web_site for my vehicle .
neutral	when i received that part it was actually for another vehicle .
neutral	i understand messing up every now and then .
neutral	what i don_'_t understand is why i have to pay for shipping when someone_else screws up .
neutral	i probably will not order again .
neutral	i ordered a complete tail_light module including wiring_harness & bulbs all " ready to install " by just removing and unplugging in the old one and plugging in and attaching the new one .
neutral	bottom_line , the wiring_harness connector was completely different than the connector on the vehicle .
neutral	i used the old harness and had to replace the harness in the part they sent me and all worked out except for my extra time and labor .
neutral	at first i was a liitle aprehensive .
neutral	never hard of them .
neutral	but their website looked good and the prices were excellent .
neutral	so ... i decided to take the plunge .
neutral	everything worked out well ... initially .
neutral	then ... there was nothing .
neutral	no communication ... nothing about my order .
neutral	this went on for a good 0 . 0_weeks .
neutral	i was getting worried .
neutral	no tracking_information at their website ... etc .
neutral	so i began to write them and say .. hey !
neutral	where '_s my order ?
neutral	they wrote back apologetically and said it '_s in process .
neutral	well ... after a few rounds of email ... they came through !
neutral	i received my order and i was happy about the expereince .... especially the price .
neutral	i chalked up the negative part of the experience as their growing pains .
neutral	definitely will use again .
neutral	intake seems to be built well won_'_t know until i install it .
neutral	i bought these for my mobile home , i have not been to it yet when i do i will let you now what i think to them , many_thanks . been to can put up curtains , they look great i am well please with them , many_thanks .
neutral	sends me too many emails , one a week is plenty
neutral	i used to be able to get lenstore deliveries straight through my letterbox , which is one of the main_reasons i bought off you .
neutral	but for some bizarre reason you '_ve decided to increase the size of your packaging so that it no_longer fits through my letterbox , and i now have to mess about going to the post_office to collect them every time .
neutral	rebtel is acceptable
neutral	my order was received in two shipments , the first part was received in good condition but at_least one or two plants were not exactly_what was ordered .
neutral	the second shipment was sent before promised date but never delivered to me because of damage caused in handling .
neutral	however , the replacement shipment was also damaged when i received it .
neutral	one plant had no soil and the roots were completely exposed and the other plant had a third of its soil missing .
neutral	we noticed that nowhere on the package did the words " this end up , or do not stand on end " appear , and few other instructions !
neutral	i believe shipment problems will_continue to aggravate this company until it gets a handle on this situation .
neutral	t
neutral	i have been an identity_guard customer for several_years ( my wife as well ).
neutral	as we both have been victims of identity_theft in the past we found it necessary to have a service to monitor our credit .
neutral	it has done a worthy job of that , monitoring our credit and allowing us to check out credit_score quickly .
neutral	for the price paid , i feel_like they could offer a complimentary 0 in 0 credit_report quarterly or semi annually , as i believe they used to in the past a couple years_ago .
neutral	this was a huge diminishment of services without a price reduction in my opinion .
neutral	finally , when i was doing a refi on my house the mortgage company told me of something on my credit_report that appeared to be just a case of the clerk at a local county courthouse typing in the wrong information .
neutral	i thought this would be something rather simple to rectify and i further thought identity_guard would handle this for me as part of their service .
neutral	well , they did not nor could they even provide a good accurate number or poc for the courthouse .
neutral	yes , i was able to google it and find it myself and do the hard work myself , but i honestly believed that for almost $_000 / year i should be getting more than just a credit_monitoring service with the ability to see my credit_score , which in essence is what i get .
neutral	as a result , i am giving serious considerations to evaluating some other services for the cost - benefits ( e . g .
neutral	lifelock ).
neutral	thank_you .
neutral	the service is good but each time i '_ve picked my car up it '_s covered on at_least one side with bird droppings .
neutral	it would be nice if the bird problem could be addressed so customer '_s don_'_t always have to wash their car '_s after picking them up .
neutral	got all my parts in one box ( a total of 0 ) and no padding in the box .
neutral	there was a hole in the and some of the packaging was damaged inside .
neutral	the parts were top quality .
neutral	overall good experience .
neutral	the top i asked for was a boys ( large ) and i was posted out a boys ( medium )
neutral	they have a lot of fantastic stuff you can '_t get anywhere_else .
neutral	but if you can find it somewhere_else , it '_ll probably be cheaper_than here .
neutral	my grill moulding has the partsgeek logo all over it .
neutral	cannot see the true finish of the part .
neutral	offer bezels in chrome , and grill in chrome , but sell the trim in aluminum that almost looks_like a brushed alumnium ... now i have a two - tone grill on my restored 0000_f000 ???
neutral	?
neutral	ok company , third time in using and will be the last .
neutral	kept me waiting for my payment for awhile , but after umpteen messages , i finally got my pay .
neutral	painless ordering_process , item arrived on time as expected .
neutral	however they hastle you with too much communication .
neutral	just for the purchase of one appliance , i received 0 sms message , two automated phone_calls , one phone_call from the call_center , one call prior to delivery from the driver and 0 emails .
neutral	to cap it all off - i can track the delivery online !
neutral	the latest communication being hastling me for feedback - twice_now , for two different rating systems .
neutral	you would have received 0_stars - had it not been for the excessive communication .
neutral	product came promptly .
neutral	i had a badly blackened gate and fence , i tried one side with the product and one side with just soap and water .
neutral	the former was only marginally better .
neutral	a second application of the product all way round got some further marginally improvement but overall i suspect it was no different from products i could have bought from my local d - i - y store .
neutral	i ordered two items , a exhaust_pipe and the clamps to install it .
neutral	i paid $_00 extra for two day shipment .
neutral	i recived the exhaust_pipe immediately but the clamps didn_'_t arrive for another 0 days .
neutral	i '_m out $_00 for a fast shipment , you can '_t install the exhaust_pipe without the clamps .
neutral	not happy
neutral	buying is easy ... at_least two dozen web reports and emails to get refunds .....
neutral	i ordered 0 kumho kr 00 000 00 x00 tires on presidents day and still have not received the tires .
neutral	i received an_email from them stating they had to order the tires ?
neutral	why wasn_'_t this related to me the day i ordered and payed for the tires ?
neutral	as of today still no tracking or shipment arrival_date by email .
neutral	fitter_turned_up for appointment as planned & appeared to do a really good job ... until .
neutral	when driving home from work my steering_wheel was wobbling like mad at anything over 00 .
neutral	i also checked the pressures , my tyres should be 00psi but they only had 00psi in them !
neutral	i ended_up taking the car to my local kwikfit to be balanced up .
neutral	they sorted it but in future i '_ll go straight there & not bother with the mobile service .
neutral	i '_m very happy with the service with parts_geek except 0 order that has_been taking to long and now i had to purchase the part elsewhere and now i would like parts_geek to reemburse money owed to me i will do_bussiness with parts_geek in the future as long as i get my money back for the track bar that i purchased
neutral	ordered a side_mirror with power control for my car .
neutral	the electrical connections did not match the existing set_up .
neutral	no phone_number to call .
neutral	had to email a question to customer service about the problem .
neutral	had to wait_until the next_day to get a response .
neutral	the response did not deal with the technical issue .
neutral	it just offered a return .
neutral	i said ok .
neutral	waited another day for a response and when it came it was essentially , did i really want a return ?
neutral	this is like snail_mail .
neutral	time limits for payment for cruises within 00 days of booking are unrealistic .
neutral	your payment instructions for electronic transfers of funds should take into_consideration the 00 hour time for funds to reach your account and allowance should be given in your deadline for payment .
neutral	with a 00 hour deadline your payment instructions should insist that we notify you by phone or email that the transfer has_been activated .
neutral	you can '_t argue with the selection , and the quality of the goods i '_ve purchased on the site are surprisingly good .
neutral	what drives me batty is the ridiculous service model : it takes weeks to put_together your order , assuming they even can ; if they can '_t , they hold your refund for several days or weeks after .
neutral	returning items is a significant chore : beyond paying for the return shipping , you have to wait for it to be repackaged and shipped back to hong_kong for verification ; it can take 0 - 00 weeks to get reimbursed , preventing you from exchanging for the items you do want , since those items are likely to be long gone .
neutral	this is my last order with them -- using up credit -- until they start doing distribution for american customers from america , not hong_kong .
neutral	pre_- order of mass_effect 0 went to billing_address despite all emails and website having current address on them , really disappointing outcome from a normally stellar company
neutral	i ordered three parts , two out of the three were correct , hence the three stars .
neutral	i was sent a belt that i didn_'_t order after giving specific clarification of which belt i needed .
neutral	then after the sale when i notified them , they gave_me the option to buy another wrong part .
neutral	i was then told i could send the wrong part back , and receive a refund in two or more weeks .
neutral	terrible business .
neutral	the right part should of been sent out then the issue with resolving the wrong part addressed .
neutral	i was sent a courtesy link with the intent to purchase a replacement part , and that was even a wrong link to another wrong part .
neutral	then i was sent an_email_stating this is the only belt we sell , kind of take it or leave it .
neutral	great customer service .
neutral	i ordered labels and they turned_out great .
neutral	however i did have some issues with the website .
neutral	i didnt like how the pictures could only be stretched diagonally , you cannot adjust a picture only vertically or only horizontally .
neutral	i also never got a confirmation_email that my order was placed .
neutral	i tried to login to the website and i would type in my name and user id and nothing would happen .
neutral	i assumed the order was not placed and the labels then showed_up .
neutral	i was very pleased with the quality of the labels and it was shipped to me very quickly as well .
neutral	overall i would order from this company again but the website seems to have some bugs .
neutral	i ordered the part on sunday 0 / 00 / 0000 .
neutral	i had it delivered to where i was picking_up the car in new_york .
neutral	i trailered the car back to minnesota . the part showed_up the next_day . it took 0 days to get it to new_york , now i have to get it shipped to me in mn .
neutral	unacceptable .
neutral	was ordered on the monday , hopping to be able to go ridding by the weekend .
neutral	purchased a full xt groupset and some other items .
neutral	obviously spot on for price however when shipping out the order no attention was paid to the special options .
neutral	ie , for 000mm discs , no adapters were sent for the calipers .
neutral	i selected direct front mech , however a standard was shipped .
neutral	also the lock on grips were supplied with no bolts .
neutral	a little more care in checking the order before it went out would have resulted_in a lot less hassle and expense to me having by way of having to go out and source these parts in time for the weekend .
neutral	in the end , the amount i saved on the groupset compared to what i would have spent in the local bike shop was offset by having to fork out on these extra parts .
neutral	they were forth coming with the offer of replacement parts however would not offer me a refund on these items .
neutral	the replacement parts arrived in timely_fashion , however they are now surplus to requirement .
neutral	will more than likey support the local bike shop from now with large purchases to avoid any repeat of this hassle in the future
neutral	there was no security regarding someone entering garage if they want to steal your car .
neutral	the wrong ipad_cover was sent .
neutral	given the new ipad_cover is actualy better lookin then what i wanted but the point is that what i ordered is not what was sent .
neutral	this is gonna make me think_twice about ordering again .
neutral	i ordered two parts .
neutral	the part i did not need asap came by usps very quickly .
neutral	the other part was not in the first box and not notice was given as to the status of the part .
neutral	like , on back order or coming in another shipment .
neutral	this of coarse was the part i needed most .
neutral	then , the fact i was not able to call and only respond by e_- maill was unsettling . i e_- mailed on thursday and did not receive a answer until monday .
neutral	not too happy with these drawbacks .
neutral	you need to ring the garage before hand and make_sure you are booked in at the time you have on your order conformation .
neutral	i have had re book mine to an exact time_slot 0 days_later !
neutral	!
neutral	the book arrived quickly but it was in bad shape .
neutral	very worn and tattered , barely held together .
neutral	so i only have 0 hour '_s experience of trust_pilot but my first_impressions are :
neutral	0 . very much dislike having to log in with facebook - have some alternative idea '_s on how to tackle the issue '_s of ' real ' reviewers - other than forcing facebook on users .
neutral	0 .
neutral	nice fluid website
neutral	0 .
neutral	easy to leave reviews - i would prefer 00 point option rather_than 0 .. especially since you collate the data into ' out of 00 ' format .
neutral	0 .
neutral	biggest gripe is the lack of grouping similar companies and lack of specifics in searching .
neutral	i tried to compare mobile service providers - preferably the big 0 , it was very difficult .
neutral	also the fact that you don_'_t aggregate reviews / take into account number of reviews as_opposed to making somebody with 0 ( 0_star ) reviews is higher_than someone with 00 , 000 0 / 0_star reviews .
neutral	it means you have to trawl through nobody '_s or small businesses who '_s mates are just rating them , as_opposed to the real players or likely companies users are looking for .
neutral	i like the interface , i think there are massive opportunities for this company and can see a lot of interesting revenue streams while keeping users happy .
neutral	it will be interesting to see if the bosses employ the same strategy as i would .
neutral	i would love to see what their model is and maybe these_guys would be a sweet investment .
neutral	right now its a 0 / 00 from me .
neutral	i '_ve been waiting for my 0 pairs of fist gloves , ordered 0 to 0_weeks_ago , but they haven_'_t arrived .
neutral	hopefully , they were not lost in the mail .
neutral	this was a great product
neutral	i bought a pump and cover for my in ground_pool .
neutral	cover is great pump did not work .
neutral	after all the time and effort to replumb the pump i had to undo 0 / 0 days work to ship it back .
neutral	pretty disappointed with the product .
neutral	services ok . stock sometimes low when you order . prices very fare .
neutral	booking was nice to do online .
neutral	good prices .
neutral	car was ok , but i was expecting slightly better based on the booking i did online .
neutral	some additional usd 00 charge was done afterwards to my credit_card , hard to figure_out why .
neutral	no sweaty hands = much_better_than gloves = no stink , very easy to put on and take off .
neutral	great for travel too , due to compact size .
neutral	however , the downside is product falls apart after a few_months of use .
neutral	looking_forward to gripad elite with stronger materials !
neutral	the customer service was excellent is responding to my order details , once the order was processed it was delivered in 0 days .
neutral	even_though they shipped the wrong parts .
neutral	delivery was delayed by one more day than was promised so that '_s a little disappointing .
neutral	ship_sticks did contact me to notify me of the delay ; not sure what the mix_up was .
neutral	guess they picked_up the clubs a day late .
neutral	still , beats lugging the travel bag around !
neutral	product does work but when i bought this item , it says its great tasting .
neutral	i think this tastes horrible .
neutral	i '_ve had strawberry and vanilla and both taste as bad as each other .
neutral	excellent car received from girona airport spain .
neutral	very easy to book through website and company also has very good app for the iphone .
neutral	customer service official at the airport could have been nicer .
neutral	he was slightly abrupt and sharp when dealing_with me .
neutral	he informed me that i also had to pay 00e for the tank of petrol which was in the car .
neutral	this figure was not stated anywhere in the booking .
neutral	however i do accept it did state " pick car up full and return empty ".
neutral	the customer service officials response to me to this was " well it may not suit the customer but it suits the company to have this policy of pick_up full and return empty .
neutral	they were his exact words !!!!
neutral	some customer service that is .
neutral	my problem with this is the petrol is charged at airport prices and way to expensive .
neutral	also leaving it back empty is ridiculous and definitely a ploy by the company to make money . i had the car for 0 days and on returning the car there was still somewhere between a 0 / 0 and a 0 / 0 a tank of petrol left .
neutral	for this reason i was very unhappy about the car_hire situation overall , but as i mentioned before the standard of the car was excellent .
neutral	many_thanks ,
neutral	iwantpants is usually very efficient and the majority of my experience with purchasing from them has_been good .
neutral	however , i had one bad_experience when an item proved to be out of stock and they didn_'_t complete the rest of the order .
neutral	the customer service telephone_number failed to respond to my messages as did the e_-_mail address .
neutral	eventually i managed to get a response from sales in the shape of jeremy .
neutral	he managed to provide the rest of the order and i waited for the missing item .
neutral	after a further two months i tried to contact them again and had the same poor experience .
neutral	eventually jeremy arranged a refund .
neutral	we should have to opt in for the sms option , not opt out .
neutral	sneaky .
neutral	i purchased a $_00 game from cjs_cd_keys and i regretted i , t because it took almost 00_hours before i could receive my product .
neutral	after_submitting my order the system asked me to do three things for security :
neutral	0 .
neutral	verify my email address through and email they sent me .
neutral	- completely understandable , since they need to prevent automated programs from spamming their servers .
neutral	every company does this .
neutral	0 .
neutral	verify my paypal email address .
neutral	- it was my wife '_s , so i semi understood why they wanted me to do this .
neutral	0 .
neutral	verify a phone_number .
neutral	i didn_'_t understand this step at all .
neutral	i couldn_'_t find my cell_phone , so i gave the system my land_line .
neutral	i prompted for it to call me as my land_line is unable to get sms_messages .
neutral	the system decided that my phone was a cell_phone and would not call me .
neutral	it force me to have to submit an sms message .
neutral	i was stuck without my game because i did have text messaging and the system wouldn_'_t let_me use my phone .
neutral	so the system doesn_'_t work very well since it was completely wrong about my phone and i don_'_t get the reason for verifying a phone_number anyway .
neutral	it let you change the number so it never verified anything that had to do with me .
neutral	how does this have anything to do with security ?
neutral	so i choose the second option of providing two forms of identification and sending it to them , but blacking out all information except my address .
neutral	how is this an_alternative to a phone_number ?
neutral	does the phone_number verify you address ?
neutral	this is more security protocols than my bank goes through to create a bank_account .
neutral	it is just a $_00 game ... come on .
neutral	on a positive note i received a response very quickly , but had to resend the data since i used my wife '_s paypal_account .
neutral	i thought about all the verification they provided and the mistakes i was seeing on the website and i was a little afraid .
neutral	i mean they misspell authorized in the email they send .
neutral	perhaps it is not a legit company ?
neutral	i am afraid that the multiple email verification and phone / address verification is being sold to other_companies or going to be used for nefarious intentions .
neutral	i am really worried_about it .
neutral	i have changed all my email account passwords and going to check my credit_history soon to make_sure nothing was sold .
neutral	steam is having issues connecting to the server , so i am not sure if the product key works , but will update you guys soon .
neutral	i would not recommend this site for buying your games .
neutral	the booking process took several hours , very confusing and constantly having to start over .
neutral	we wanted to book with the bill me later option but never succeeded time after time !!
neutral	love book - it . com but almost gave up after so much precious time trying to book this hotel !
neutral	robbin & steve wheatley
neutral	why do we have to provide coding info .
neutral	to take_advantage of reorder discounts .
neutral	i forgot on my last order .
neutral	so i lost out , i guess .
neutral	i just wonder_why companies make it more difficult for frequent buyers to obtain discounts ?
neutral	you have our records .
neutral	why do customers have to do the work ?
neutral	it looks_like you want your customers to forget .
neutral	i guess you make more that way .
neutral	i think i will investigate somewhere_else to purchase my supplements .
neutral	this is the third time i have used floraqueen .
neutral	the flowers looked great and were delivered on time to the right location .
neutral	the first order used one of my email_addresses .
neutral	i get your special_offers at that email .
neutral	my second order , i don_'_t know what happened to my records because i did not get notifications !
neutral	however , i now get your special_offers , so i think it was registered .
neutral	fortunately , the flower was delivered .
neutral	now i just placed a third order , using my second email address .
neutral	i want to combine my previous order records under one account .
neutral	when i tried to write an_email , your " customer service button " at the bottom of your screens , takes you to a page that has a " how do i contact floraqueen " link .
neutral	but when you follow the link , you are back to the " my account " screen .
neutral	this is circular logic !
neutral	the result is that there is no way for an account_holder to email you !
neutral	the only email account is the generic info @ floraqueen . com account .
neutral	overall this is a nice light for the money .
neutral	i would spend more for the necessary improvements .
neutral	it is heavy_duty , but also very heavy .
neutral	the light needs to be made of a heavy aluminum , but not cause wrist fatigue because of the weight .
neutral	a switch on - off would make the light easier to use underwater .
neutral	presently the light has a twist feature which means both hand are required to turn it on and off .
neutral	this could lead to an accidental drop of the light .
neutral	with an on - off switch , a goodman handle or scula glove could be added .
neutral	i like the efficiency of the service and also the speed of delivery for the order .
neutral	if you hunt around though you can get cheaper oil so boilerjuice does not pass on huge_savings even with their massive purchasing power .
neutral	i have received the game that i ordered , although through a fair bit of hassle but in the end they came through .
neutral	i appreciate the assistance and the polite nature in which they gave their response but i ' d also warn people to be wary that there may be some technical hiccups that mare their usage of this site .
neutral	all in all , they did come through , so i '_ll give them that but the technical_issues are off putting and hopefully in the future they will be seen to .
neutral	:)
neutral	i was under the impression that the item would be a hard backing " skin " for the phone , rather_than a stick - on decoration .
neutral	probably didn_'_t read the details properly .
neutral	that said , the quality of the print is good and the item was sent quickly .
neutral	i '_m not sure that it was worth the money paid ; it would have been very good value for a patterned hard cover , but not for what it actually is .
neutral	while a great booking sytem aids customer service a measure of customer service in these systems is what happens when it goes_wrong .
neutral	also if you system is not intuative and answers are not readily_available it will cause issues .
neutral	in the case of skytours the system of booking is pretty good but in both the above senarios it falls short .
neutral	i note the terms and conditions around my email .
neutral	please ensure you respect your verbage
neutral	we ordered 00 # bag of food and two cases of cans .
neutral	the bottom of the box was ruptured and the food was hanging out .
neutral	the tape closing the box was not strong_enough for the shipment .
neutral	we have signed_up for regular shipments and i don_'_t want failed packaging again .
neutral	winter_tyres bought at a great price bottom_line .
neutral	sonme issues with previous order and delays in getting the tyres to the fitting_centre but the price was so good that this provided counterbalance .
neutral	will likely use again in the summer to replace two worn summer tyres .
neutral	core_returns should be setup automatically at purchase with the return address provided .
neutral	i should not have to contact partsgeek again to obtain rma and address .
neutral	in the process of shopping for a replacement compressor for a mecercedes e000 ( base model , rwd ) i investigated products offered by parts_geek .
neutral	the listings within the parts_geek site included both denso an four_seasons compressors ( and others ).
neutral	both the denso and four_seasons listings showed the picture of a compressor with clutch and grooved pulley , though the text of the four_seasons compressor stated that the clutch ( and pulley ) was included , while the denso listing stated that the compressor was shipped with oil and " o " rings , but made no mention of the clutch and pulley .
neutral	an e_-_mail to parts_geek , ( promptly answered ) assured me that the clutch and pulley was included , which upon placing the order and receiving the order was confirmed as true .
neutral	the issue however , was that the compressor was shipped without the adverstised " o " rings , as the large " o " ring was not shipped , and the small " o " ring was the " o " ring used for shipping purposes , and of undetermined composition ( in other_words was not the typical hnbr , green " o " ring product used in refrigeration systems ).
neutral	while i keep a good assortment of " o " rings in stock , the large " o " ring used in this mercedes application is not one of them , which caused me the need to order an expanded assortment , which from my perspective was much more expeditious than complaining_about the missing ( low value ) parts .
neutral	in any event , the missing ( low value ) part ( s ) resulting in a delay in completing the work .
neutral	parts_geek is a great supplier and efficient shipper of recognized brands of auto_parts , however you need to take a " leap of faith " when shopping their site , as the listed parts frequently have ambiguous text curious applications references and notes .
neutral	part geek is a supplier that delivers very good value with a good business model , though it has a lot of work to do with respect to simply and accurately describing what they are selling .
neutral	booking experience was great , but when i arrived at hotel they did not have my reservation .
neutral	luckily there were available rooms , but could have been worst if they didn_'_t .
neutral	booked in for a friday_afternoon , waited_until gone 0pm when had call to say they were behind and running very late may not be til 0pm onwards can they do monday_morning
neutral	which i stupidly said yes without thinking so had to take monday off
neutral	no offer of saturday !
neutral	eventually came 00am monday but when came a good fitter and good work
neutral	the process of purchasing was great .
neutral	but part didnt fit car as advertise .
neutral	it created a big hassle for me .
neutral	dont_know yet if i will be purchasing anythign else with you guys .
neutral	for the most part , the prices are very good , but i did find better prices for similar items on competitor sites .
neutral	the 0 % price undercut is a great feature , but is only useful if supplement_warehouse carries the same exact product as the competitor which in many cases , it does not .
neutral	the selection is not fantastic and the website itself is very difficult to navigate .
neutral	the ability to browse by category would be a huge improvement .
neutral	the shipping_costs are way too high !
neutral	this should be fixed asap - i may have saved a few dollars on my order , but i would have been better off ordering it from a competitor and paying about half as much for shipping .
neutral	it would have worked out to probably less money .
neutral	i bought three chamois grips and some orange stick tape .
neutral	the chamois are fine .
neutral	it the tape is much less sticky than some i have purchased in the past .
neutral	i am pretty sure i bought the same type but it has come loose a couple of times .
neutral	the food i received was fantastic tasting and portion wise extreme valie for money with the quality you get .
neutral	the only one minor_issue i had was the food wasnt cold when it arrived .
neutral	i checked delivery status and the morning it was loaded onto van wasnt when it was delivered it was delivered the afternoon after so not sure if the package sat all night in the van .
neutral	other than that great company to order from .
neutral	delivery . com sends me an $ 0 off coupon every few weeks and that '_s awesome !
neutral	however , food arrives anywhere between 0 - 0 . 0 h ours with no eta provided .
neutral	other services , such as grubhub , provide up to date eta '_s via_email and text .
neutral	delivery . com also doesn_'_t seem to have up to date menus or delivery statuses .
neutral	several_times i have place an order and waited over an_hour for delivery .
neutral	only afte calling the restaurant or delivery . com did i eventually find out the restaurant is not delivering that day .
neutral	that is extremely frustrating !
neutral	if you have a favorite restaurant that is listed on delivery . com , i suggest you go out of your way to visit that place and let them know you '_ll be ordering frequently .
neutral	if there '_s an issue then they ' re more likely to call you directly and be much_easier to deal with - at_least that '_s been my experience .
neutral	happy eating !
neutral	my international delivery took_longer_than originally expected and the item was left outside of my unit without the postal guy even ringing my door_bell or knocking on the door .
neutral	i know that the postal company are a third_party supplier , but this was part of my experience .
neutral	i would suggest using a different local shipping company .
neutral	otherwise a great product at a great price .
neutral	i am an old guy , 00 years , a professional who travels often on vacation and rents cars frequently .
neutral	almost every time i return a rented car to an unattended station after hours , i find a little unexplained extra on my next visa bill .
neutral	never an explanation .
neutral	last time , march_0000 , in venice , hertz , it was a 00 euros charge .
neutral	was it for gas ?
neutral	the dash showed full , was the car dirty ?
neutral	not especially , i don_'_t smoke and i was alone .
neutral	most_likely , hertz and others find it easy to pluck a few extra euros or dollars from out of country customers .
neutral	who will bother to complain for ten bucks ?
neutral	this never happens when i return a car to a staffed station .... maybe because i make_sure i get a release .
neutral	i understand that the rental_car business is tough , competitive and has razor thin margins ...... but it is a tacky and unprofessional way to do_business ...

neutral	a beer . not the best quality to handle a beer social
neutral	tutto_bene , tranne il fatto che_il_prodotto è_arrivato con 0 giorni di ritardo ,.
neutral	sul_sito ogni giorno compariva una nuova scritta " in spedizione " e , non essendo stati mai chiamati per spiegarci il ritardo , ho dovuto chiamare io più volte !!
neutral	!
neutral	non esiste !!!!

neutral	there are many things i like about this website but i know you can do better - it '_s a little cluttered and a little_confusing at times .
neutral	when you look at it with fresh eyes i know you '_ll make the right changes
neutral	the pricing was very good compares to nyc .
neutral	however , the facility was not in great shape - expired lightbulbs , temperature set ridiculously_low to save_money , moving carts with broken wheels , etc
neutral	i ordered axle bearings for a 00 gmc safari .
neutral	there were three bearings found from the search .
neutral	the problem is there '_s no info to compare the difference_between them .
neutral	the bearing set i ordered and received turned_out to be a special type of bearing that '_s designed to deal with damaged axle bearing surface area .
neutral	chevy astro '_s and gmc safari '_s rear axle uses the axle surface to act as what would normally be the inner bearing race .
neutral	i guess it won_'_t hurt anything to use them but if i was aware of this difference i would not have choose them .
neutral	great website , great comms , nice brand and all at a competitive price .
neutral	i would suggest using a courier service that shares your principles as an organisation .
neutral	i would_happily pay extra to use a better courier and i wouldn_'_t use ms again if i knew my parcel was been delivered by uk mail .
neutral	i have nothing but problems with them .
neutral	it '_s a 0_stars from me but a 0_star with a different parcel company
neutral	you expect to have the money paid into your bank_account the same day they receive and test your phone .
neutral	unfortunately for me this took 0 working days and you begin to wonder_whether you will be paid at all .
neutral	their competitors claim you receive same day payment , however i have never sold a phone with them , so there is work to be done !
neutral	slightly disappointed with the lack of communication offered by envirofone too , i had to log_into the website to check for updates .
neutral	fast shipping , i predict someone returned part but put it in the wrong box .
neutral	i received the wrong part in the incorrectly labeled box .
neutral	had to buy from someone_else and return part .
neutral	i bought a pair of sneakers for my sister in law for her 00th_birthday .
neutral	i live in dubai , my sister in law lives in the uk .
neutral	when i came to enter a delivery address , i checked the ' add new address ' box and entered her address .
neutral	what i didn_'_t notice was that as i her address , the ' add new address ' checkbox unchecked itself .
neutral	when i received a confirmation_email , i saw that the shoes were apparently going to be delivered to me in dubai .
neutral	i emailed customer service , who cancelled the order .
neutral	i placed the order again and again , when i entered my sister in law '_s address , the box unchecked itself .
neutral	again i didn_'_t notice this , i placed the order anyways and again , i got an_email_telling_me that the shoes were on their way to dubai .
neutral	again i emailed customer service , again , the order was cancelled .
neutral	it was only on the third attempt that i noticed that the box was unchecking itself .
neutral	so ... end of the day the shoes got to my sister in law , but i have to ask why your site unchecked the add new address checkbox when i entered the address .
neutral	i had to check the box , enter the address and then check the box again .
neutral	if you need folks to check the box again , would it not make_sense to situate it below the address fields rather_than above ?
neutral	as a user i don_'_t expect to have to backwards while completing a retail transaction .
neutral	why should i slog through a weekly list of over 000 possible attractions , often including numerous events that i would never in a million years attend ( and that could easily be excluded by genre )?
neutral	because almost inevitably , item # 00 might be the gem i '_ve been looking for .
neutral	in the era of mass customization , i don_'_t understand_why goldstar doesn_'_t allow me to personalize the selection in each weekly bulletin -- which would almost certainly lead to an increase in purchases .
neutral	i spent over $_000 in supplements and one of the products they were advertising was to come with a free " premium shaker ".
neutral	never received it .
neutral	wrote customer service twice and got nothing back besides a conformation_email_letting_me know they received my complaint .
neutral	ordered 00 ink replacements for canon_pixma printer .
neutral	excellent information and speed of delivery as usual .
neutral	but .
neutral	00 small boxes just thrown_into a jiffy_bag and suffered the rigors of the post_office .
neutral	crushed boxes and a real mix_up in the bag .
neutral	new packaging has made it difficult to see what colour is in the box .
neutral	most_important - i am getting a ' feeling ' that the quality of the ink is not what it was .
neutral	photos are not as clear or colourfull as they were a year_ago .
neutral	could be the printer i suppose , but just have that niggling feeling it is the ink .....
neutral	good marketing is fine , but must be backed_up with quality .
neutral	when i placed my order i intentionally made certain that all parts were ordered from the same warehouse .
neutral	yet i do not receive all together .
neutral	tracking_info is confusing .
neutral	we are satisfied , but it took too_long
neutral	the first order i made with them went fine but on the second order the product page says they have over 00 keys in stock and they are available for instant delivery .
neutral	so i ordered through moneybookers to get the instant delivery only to find that they don_'_t actually have any of the keys in stock and i need to wait 00_hours
neutral	central_contracts staff where very nice to deal with and would recommend to others , i did think the extent i had to go to to prove who i was , was excessive for the finance .
neutral	i am on a regular automatic_reorder with petflow and the timing of shipments is fine .
neutral	the problem is every order without_exception , the box is broken apart and the bag of dog_food is exposed to damage .
neutral	i order a lot online and have not had this problem with other_companies , including other_companies that i have ordered 00 pound_bags of dog_food from in the past .
neutral	very good service .
neutral	i orded shocks for my pickup .
neutral	the front shocks picture had showed one shock , i orded two at $_00 .
neutral	the rear_shocks had a picture showing a pair at $_00 .
neutral	my thanking was $_00 per shock .
neutral	so i ended_up with an extra pair .
neutral	the front shocks for toyota 000 0000 truck would not fit due to the dust cover ( top of shocks ) did not have clearance .
neutral	needed one with rubber cover .
neutral	by this time i had damaged the paint on the shock .
neutral	i went an got shocks with rubber dust coverers .
neutral	i was going to return them , but the restocking_fee and shipping was too much .
neutral	end of story - a set of shocks for sale .
neutral	the pure_formulas site was very easy to find what you needed & they shipping was very quick .
neutral	but they sent the wrong flavor !
neutral	i am confident that i ordered dutch chocolate ultra meal plus 000 but they sent natural vanilla flavor .
neutral	other wise i would give them a 0_star_rating .
neutral	figured it wasn_'_t worth the hassle to call them and shipping it back to them and waiting for a correct delivery .
neutral	i will try them again and if they ship the right product i i will keep ordering from them .
neutral	if not i will order from some where else .
neutral	.
neutral	process worked ok , but driver delivering vehicle back was an_idiot .
neutral	he drove at night with only side lights getting beeped by other drivers on the road .
neutral	also really annoyed by £ 0 charge to get out of the drop_off zone , we only had euros and it was a complete faff ... just add it to the cost of the parking !!
neutral	!
neutral	the initial setup was easy and the price was good .
neutral	the contact from the customer service was good and helpful .
neutral	the movement of the parcel was good , quick and ahead of schedule .
neutral	unfortunately though the parcel was delivered to somewhere not connected to the address and was signed for by someone other than the named person on the label .
neutral	the tracking_system did not give a specific place of where it was delivered .
neutral	this could have been the loss of the box altogether but with a lot of phone_calls it was found .
neutral	its difficult to see the quality of a hat online
neutral	my report has_been up dated a few_times since i enrolled , but they have not caught up yet , so_far fair at best .
neutral	ordering was easy and my chairs were shipped on the estimated delivery date .
neutral	the prices and selection are much_better_than locally and the chairs appear high_quality .
neutral	my only issue was with delivery .
neutral	there were at_least two companies involved in the delivery .
neutral	one delivered the chairs to another delivery company .
neutral	the final company cancelled two appointments at the last_minute which_resulted_in me having to adjust my work schedule .
neutral	when it was delivered , they were polite , but didn_'_t take much care of my hardwood floors or carpet when they were coming in the house .
neutral	also , they did not set_up the chairs completely , just hooked them together without using the screws to secure them .
neutral	i would order again , but skip the white_glove delivery and just bring them in my self with a friend and set_up .
neutral	i '_ve had to return my laptop to the store no less_than 0 times now and my issue still has not been fixed !
neutral	could not speak to a person by phone , ups took a week for delivery .
neutral	great price though on part i needed
neutral	i was really annoyed by the delivery charge for kw00 postcode .
neutral	you are not alone in the approach you take to the highlands of scotland , and i fully appreciate you are in the hands of your couriers , but websites should not have large banners saying free delivery when it is not , and i think that companies like you should get a national deal for delivery sorted_out for the mainland_uk .
neutral	i am happy with my purchase , just not the delivery charge
neutral	john
neutral	i bought a set of corner glass shelves here because the prices were very good compared to similar products from other manufacturers / stores .
neutral	however , i had contacted them afterwards about returning unopened ( box all unopeend , even the original ups box it came in ), and was told that i ' d be subject to restocking_fees and i ' d have to pay for the return shipping .
neutral	i '_m used to amazon . com where returns are quite easy ...
neutral	so anyways , make_sure when you order you are certain you want it , because returns aren_'_t up to what i '_m used to .
neutral	otherwise good prices , i ' d still check them out .
neutral	i ordered a mirror the mirror for a saturn ion ( sedan ).
neutral	the site did not give anywhere to choose between a sedan and a coupe .
neutral	i ordered what i thought was the right mirror , but it was not .
neutral	i paid $_00 plus the shipping for the return and received only the cost of the part as refund .
neutral	if you order from this place make double and triple sure you have the right part , or be prepared to pay .
neutral	the hostels are really sad and poor in maintance , and modern facilities , and the worst one is the pillow in barcelona this is really bad and does not match the pictures or the information provided .
neutral	it is like the hostels are the 0 or 0_stars hotels compares to the international hostels .
neutral	hi , product was sent super quick and very happy with it , only grip is the packinging was not clearly_labelled to meet my country guidlines and was quaratined which_resulted_in my having to pay a 00 pound fee !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
neutral	i don_'_t think i will buy from again due to this .
neutral	i have used the product for week and have no effect on my neuropathy i still have server pain and pain gel is only temporary for a few_minutes only .
neutral	i will_continue until i have used the 00 day supply and see if there is any improvement but if none i will not continue the treatments
neutral	i had a motorola photon 0g cell_phone that was malfunctioning .
neutral	i liked the fact that squaretrade let_me take it to a local authorized repair store .
neutral	i didn_'_t like the $_00 deductible up front .
neutral	the repair facility reviewed the phone and their assessment was that the motherboard was failing .
neutral	i also had to mail the phone to squaretrade which i didn_'_t like .
neutral	it would have been nice to keep my operational phone until i could purchase a new one or to have it as a back up .
neutral	when my home warranty cashed out my refrigerator with a broken ice machine , i still got to keep the functional refrigerator .
neutral	they were quite prompt in delivering me the check for $_000 for the phone '_s full original value .
neutral	as soon as i shipped the phone , that evening they credited my paypal_account .
neutral	parts seemed okay and a good price .
neutral	however , their initial response said i would receive an_email within 00_hours concerning the delivery of my part .
neutral	never did until i contacted them and then i received the part the same day they responded .
neutral	also , since i had a core to return , i thought one of their emails would say something about that , but i had to contact them first about the core_return .
neutral	when they finally responded about the core_return , they said to return items in original box and not write on them or they would not return your core_charge .
neutral	that is completely unfair considering they did not give me that information until a week after i received and installed the part .
neutral	with them being so slow at giving important information how would i know to keep the boxes or not write on them .
neutral	seems like a trap to keep your money .
neutral	also , they take your money within a couple of hours of placing your order , but then they tell you it will be 00 days to return your core .
neutral	that is very poor business in this age of computers .
neutral	i guess they want your money to draw more interest sitting in their bank_account .
neutral	not sure i will do_business this way anymore , unless they have a very good price and no core is involved .
neutral	there needs to be a much closer correspondence between the automobiles shown in the autoeurope car selection menu and the one that '_s actually offered by the rental_companies .
neutral	i ordered a mercedes a type with 0 doors and a hatchback , and was offered a renault_megane with two doors , no luggage space , and a convertible hardtop !
neutral	useless !
neutral	fortunately , the dealer responded to my polite rage by finding a bmw 000 - series car the next_day .
neutral	i received my product quickly and at a good price .
neutral	however , there are times when one needs to speak to an person for help in selecting the proper part .
neutral	i have never been able to reach anyone via phone !
neutral	maybe it '_s all automated ... no humans !
neutral	my only_complaint is the speed it took .
neutral	a week from dropping the parcel off to acknowledging receipt , then a week to check the products , then a week to receive the money .
neutral	it makes me laugh when i get emails stating , get money quickly !
neutral	needed a specific length & fit of bb , wiggle had best price , but on " 0 - 0_weeks " delivery which i could live with .
neutral	after 0_weeks still hadnt showed_up and when queried they said it would be another month or so .
neutral	their best alternative was significantly more_expensive , and indeed i could get it at a lower price elsewhere .
neutral	had a hard job convincing them to price match even_though they ' d let_me down on my first choice .
neutral	when they did finally agree , i had to cancel the first order , get a refund of the paypal and place new order with the price match coupon .
neutral	once i ' d done all that the replacement did actually arrive quite quickly , but the whole_experience was a bit meh !
neutral	meget blandet service .
neutral	normalt rigtig_god service , men af og til horribel og arrogant behandling .
neutral	var_en gang ude for at_købe fordærvet fisk , der både lugtede dårligt og var_gået over sidste salgsdag .

neutral	jo tak , men over diste salgsdag , fisk over ågerpriser og_så med rådden lugt ...
neutral	det_er da fint kokken er glad , men_det_var jeg_ikke og de mails jeg_fik gjorde tydeligt opmærksom_på at det_var mig der_var besværlig .

neutral	og blev så afkrævet godt 000_kr .
neutral	i fragt .
neutral	da_jeg bad om at få slettet fragten , blev_jeg mødt med endnu en gang ballade , hvor_de på eget initiativ havde kørt det_ud med_en fragtmand og nu mente at jeg_skulle betale for deres valg .
neutral	det endte med de slettede den , men uden svar_på mine mails .
neutral	så når tingene kører , så_er_det en super forretning , når tingene ikke kører og ejerne blander sig , så bliver man badet i dårlig service og arrogance ...
neutral	the service is good and delivery is quick , on this last order the packer gave_us the wrong order , so we had to post the order back and wait for the correct order , but with the good service we have always had we will still be using this site
neutral	i ordered the right front marker_light_lens_assembly , for a 0000 , mercury grand_marquis , good price , but the harness assembly was wrong .
neutral	with what was sent , i ended_up with female to female ........
neutral	i would like to see them make it right by sending the correct harness .
neutral	thank_you .
neutral	this was a hidden price deal on travelocity .
neutral	$_00 a night was pretty good .
neutral	the breakfast was standard fare .
neutral	the room was comfortable enough .
neutral	there were renovations going on ( replacing carpet ) that took up a portion of the parking .
neutral	the staff was pretty good .
neutral	the only real " con " to my stay was the hot_water .
neutral	i had to run the water in the sink for more than 00_minutes waiting for it to get hot so i could shave , but it never got more than lukewarm .
neutral	the shower the night before was plenty hot , so i don_'_t know what happened overnight .
neutral	overall , it was ok . like i said , it was a roof over my head for the night .
neutral	the service was hassle_free .
neutral	the packing of the product i received was horrible .
neutral	i was really surprised the product made it .
neutral	i can not rate something that is not complete .
neutral	i did not know one item was on back order until i received it at my house .
neutral	i have other company '_s that i can buy from and i could have gotten what i ordered from them .
neutral	brushy mountain had what you guys back ordered .
neutral	i would appreciate a heads up next time .
neutral	some of the ink_cartridges will not work on my printer .
neutral	the printer will not recognize the cartridge .
neutral	a few cartridges have colors that are not correct .
neutral	this slows down my projects .
neutral	the part arrived after a week since i order b0 memorial_day it was the wrong two versions that year .
neutral	u can '_t the dealer .
neutral	plus customer service suckers .
neutral	i wrote the above but what u gotta do is be a little patient coz all communication is via_email no phone_calls .
neutral	ur rma will take a little while but it get there .
neutral	if i had the right part i woulda gave em a 0 .
neutral	first_class service - purchase arrived next_day , but , we had to send if off to further remedial work as it was unusable in the state it arrived .
neutral	actual flowers were much less then how it was portrayed on the website
neutral	it '_s been a little while now and my garden hose has not arrived !
neutral	had made an_appointment , but didn_'_t seem to give any priority vs . walk - ins .
neutral	took about 0 0 / 0 hours for 0 new tires plus alignment .
neutral	not bad , but longer_than the 00 to 00_minutes i was told in advance .
neutral	i have always had very good luck with parts_geek , unti i received a evaporator that was just tossed into a box with no packing .
neutral	when i got it you could see the part through the holes in the box where ups had mashed it and taped the box back together .
neutral	this was a real problem as the customers car had been down for a week waiting for this part .
neutral	i refused the package and called parts_geek . they said they could not send another until i paid again .
neutral	i did and they refunded my money { 0 - 0 days } still_waiting for the new one .
neutral	this will make two_weeks with the car sitting in my shop in parts . i don , t know who to be mad at , parts_geek for not packing it right or ups for mashing it .
neutral	anyway i , m the one who has to tell my customer they can , t drive their car for two_weeks for a 0 hr .
neutral	job .
neutral	the suit was described as having double vents when it arrived it had no vents .
neutral	when i contacted the company they first of all said i got what i ordered .
neutral	i phoned again as not happy with this answer spoke to some one else who said that the web_site was wrong and they would change it .
neutral	that was it .
neutral	i object to being given a price then a booking_fee appears .
neutral	dishonest that you cannot book the price shown .
neutral	the driver wasn_'_t kind with us .
neutral	he didn_'_t try to made us understand about the questions wh gave him .
neutral	item i ordered took almost 0_weeks to be delievered .
neutral	i was emailed personally by an employee ( without intervention ) stating it would arrive a bit sooner even_though it didn_'_t .
neutral	it is really nice product but the one that i recieved is warped .
neutral	hard to put the pin all the way thru .
neutral	the pop in section will not fit correctly ., the botton snaps in fine and as you work your way up the top will not pop in ?
neutral	you finnlay get the top to pop in and the bottom pops out .
neutral	i tried for over 0 hour taking it apart and watching video but to no help .
neutral	we need more follow_up information like web check in etc .
neutral	i didn_'_t have a seat allocated , would be nice to know why .
neutral	do i do this or is it handled for me !
neutral	to hard guys
neutral	you provide a means to track an order which does not work .
neutral	i ordered a book on june_00th and i have yet to receive confirmation that it has arrived and today is june_00th .
neutral	you had the part i needed it was higher_priced than others but they didn_'_t have it
neutral	your recently opened shop in midgate has never had the e_- juices i require .
neutral	you need to sort out your stocking issues .
neutral	there '_s no point in having all your good e_- juices in one shop but not the other , to be honest it puts me off using you because you never have a full range .
neutral	good price , fast service .
neutral	returning a part is a pain .
neutral	i gave up after a 00 minute wait on the phone to talk to someone .
neutral	my time is valuable to me .
neutral	i would pay shipping twice , plus a 00_% restock_fee , and 00_minutes of my time waiting on the phone for a $_00 part .
neutral	i decided to just keep it .
neutral	not worth the trouble , coast and time to return .
neutral	they sent the wrong part but have a policy of not paying for return shipping .
neutral	so , since they made a mistake , i '_m out shipping_costs .
neutral	the bag was a present for my girl_friend and she_loves it , so the product is excellent .
neutral	however , having fedex send me a bill for customs charges without_any prior notice was baloney .
neutral	you could have just charged me the $_00 extra up front and it would have been no problem .
neutral	hi some numbers i cant contact don_'_t know why , is it there server ?
neutral	vince
neutral	my wife_loves the watch and the gift which came with it .
neutral	my concern is that had i not phoned and spoke to [_name ] i would have not known that it had been dispatched , and therefore i should be expecting it within the next few_days .
neutral	my understanding is that an_email should be sent to inform that the watch has_been dispatched so that arrangements can be made to accept delivery .
neutral	the only email i received on this order was from paypal to inform_me that a payment had been made to nigel_o ' hara .
neutral	i had more emails from a guy_who sold me two battery '_s for £ 0 . 00 !!
neutral	!
neutral	as i said way back my wife really loves the watch , so thank_you for getting that right and thank_you [_name ] for your help ..
neutral	paid for next_day delivery for one dispatched on friday , to get a weekend delivery .
neutral	got a no - delivery note on monday & a mildly pissy note on wed . to be fair , they came the next saturday .
neutral	only had one shake so_far ; the packaging is great , the mixer is good , the butterscotch flavour needs a bit more taste though !
neutral	it '_s quaffable but a bit limp .
neutral	did not get all parts ordered
neutral	i would use bookit . com again but just watch for rate changes .
neutral	they had the cheapest rate by a few_bucks a night and offered a variety of payment_options .
neutral	i used an installment plan as i couldn_'_t afford the full_amount for an all - inclusive resort for the honeymoon at the moment ( very convenient !).
neutral	i was a bit upset after checkout though .
neutral	as i was building my package i was quoted a total of $ 0000 .
neutral	after checkout i realized that i was charged $ 0000 and realized that the nightly per person rate went up a few_bucks .
neutral	it may have changed prior to my final submission but felt_like it was snuck in at some point .
neutral	i called to see why this happened and if i could get $_00 bucks back with no luck .
neutral	i was simply told that rates at subject to change at any moment due to demand ( although , i doubt anyone_else was booking that specific hotel for that specific date at 0 am ).
neutral	overall , i would recommend bookit . com and will probably use them again if the rates are good .
neutral	been 00 days and still_haven_'_t recieved my item ... should have spent the extra $_00 and bought it local and fixed my truck a lot quicker
neutral	we ordered a spray for an uncle '_s funeral on 0 nov .
neutral	the delivery to the funeral directors on 0st nov was fine but to be honest we were disappointed with the flowers themselves .
neutral	a number of them were very much past their best .
neutral	i have just had a response from iflorist with apologies for our disappointment and confirming that they will refund the full cost of the flowers .
neutral	i wasn_'_t expecting this and it is very much_appreciated .
neutral	i ordered another part from another site .
neutral	same time .
neutral	both standard shipping .
neutral	got theres last_week .
neutral	still_waiting for the one from you
neutral	i fly every week , so i park at this place for 0 . 0 days every week .
neutral	some of the drivers are nice and friendly .
neutral	some don_'_t say a word ( which is fine too .)
neutral	the vehicles are nice and clean .
neutral	they always get me to the airport in a hurry , which is great .
neutral	the two negatives are : every thursday_night when i fly back into newark , i call them for pickup .
neutral	and every week i have to spell my name for the guy on the phone and explain to him that i don_'_t have a ticket number because i am an ltp_club member .
neutral	it '_s like he has never_heard of me before .
neutral	yet 0 . 0 days ago when i parked , i told them exactly_what time i would be returning ( and it '_s the same time every week .)
neutral	so why can '_t they know to expect my call from the airport at that time ?
neutral	since their computer has my information , they should be able to access it , right ?
neutral	i thought i would get " special treatment " by getting an ltp_club membership card , but it doesn_'_t work that way .
neutral	the one thing the card does do though , which is really great , is that i just scan the card at the gate when i enter , and then when i return to newark , i get out of the shuttle van at the lot , jump in my warmed_up car , and drive out , scanning my card at the gate to exit - fully self service .
neutral	i don_'_t have to go into the office , which is great .
neutral	i receive a receipt automatically via_email about 0 minutes after i pass through the exit gate .
neutral	the other major negative is that sometimes i have to wait 0 minutes for a pickup , most times it '_s 00 - 00_minutes , and far too often i have to wait 00 or even 00_minutes .
neutral	they always have a good excuse ( traffic was heavy , there was construction , etc .
neutral	), but 00_minutes seems like a really long time to wait , especially when vans from other lots come and go and come_back again while i am still sitting there waiting .
neutral	bottom_line : i keep_coming_back just because of the convenience of the ltp card .
neutral	but the frequent long_waits for airport pickup annoy the heck out of me every time .
neutral	had long wait despite few customers .. tires installed on front , notes on invoice specified tires to be installed in back
neutral	i always have a look at wiggle and check out their stock and prices .
neutral	i find their choice limited and their prices aren_'_t particularly competitive .
neutral	i '_ve often found items cheaper and tried their price match policy but as a rule they generally find something that isn_'_t ' exactly ' the same as their listing and get out of price_matching .
neutral	delivery times aren_'_t particularly good and can sometimes be frustrating , if you order a component chances are you need it to get your bike back on the road , so waiting four days can leave you agitated .
neutral	free next_day delivery should be standard .
neutral	customer service are slow to respond to emails , again , if you '_ve got a mechanical issue you need answers fast !
neutral	i generally use chain_reaction cycles , huge choice , better customer service and generally better on price with lightning_fast delivery .
neutral	as the title suggest , wiggle could do better ......................
neutral	appreciate your site .
neutral	it took me half_hour today to cancel a reservation that i had made 00_hours before : why make it so difficult ?
neutral	it '_s a month ahead and not even 00_hours had passed since my mistaken date reservation .
neutral	i realize it was not refundable but i was giving you very prompt notice of my mistake .
neutral	it was not 00_hours before : it was a month before .
neutral	i expect a full_refund to be processed .
neutral	thanks .
neutral	past orders have been acceptable , no real issues .
neutral	but typical specials are 00_%_off of 0 item .
neutral	i always order multiple items to save on shipping_costs , 00_%_off 0 item is not appealing .
neutral	also , once you place an order and get on email list you will get many , many emails .
neutral	very good products priced very good till you get done with the shipping_charges
neutral	a 00 sensor and it cost 0 dollars ground ??????
neutral	?
neutral	we got a very good deal with them at_heathrow .
neutral	the check - in was painfully slow but everything after that went well and returning the car was very quick .
neutral	the shuttle service was frequent .
neutral	they need to do something about improving their chek - in procedures .
neutral	some people waited over 00_minutes to be seen .
neutral	not fun after flying for 00_hours !
neutral	!
neutral	great product fast shipping but info on page said product was made in italy though real product was made in china .
neutral	i did my research and found out ray_ban had began recently to make more of its products in china so does not mean product is a replica .
neutral	should update to not mislead consumers .
neutral	ordered and it took to long to receive the book almost had to buy it from bookstore .
neutral	shipping not good and figured it would come with prepaid package nope have to pay to ship it back .
neutral	won_'_t order from again
neutral	the purchase was good and if you are able to be in on the day of delivery - excellent service .
neutral	quality plant but still_waiting for the rest of my order .
neutral	header basically says it all .
neutral	guessing it was bad chips on those drives - data wasn_'_t fully_loaded and when i tried to reformat and reload the chips broke totally
neutral	booked a hotel with bookit . com , was an easy process and the price was just right .
neutral	however a week_later we had to modify the trip by shifting it one day , it was still a month out and i did not see a problem .
neutral	when i went on my samsung tablet to modify the reservation it kept showing me i had to pay for the whole trip again .
neutral	i reset my tablet and rebooted it three_times .
neutral	when i called to see what was the problem they wanted to charge me $_00 to fix it over the phone ( rip - off ) their software is not 000_% compatible with android , and they just wanted $_00 to fix it over the phone ?
neutral	when i to use the desktop computer it did work fine and i only had to pay the additional amount plus a $_00 . 00 modification fee .
neutral	so all in all if you have no changes and use a windows computer bookit . com is a good deal ( calling the hotel_directly i would not of had to pay the modification fee , the hotel also would have thrown in a breakfast for 0 and a bogo dinner at the hotel .
neutral	the guide for the fist half of the tour was excellent .
neutral	amusing and informative .
neutral	sadly he changed shift half way round and the second guide spoke ( almost ) only about famous people and things that were expensive .
neutral	his delivery was semi musical and not easily_understood .
neutral	in retrospect we should have got off and waited for thie next bus - but hindsight is always perfect .
neutral	i was able to track that you had dispatched my goods promptly but the delivery firm claimed that had tried to deliver my goods 0 times and left a card .
neutral	i was at home at_least one of the times they said they tried to deliver .
neutral	they didn_'_t leave any cards - i live in a flat and our letterboxes are behind an electronically locked door so it is a physical impossibility .
neutral	nor did they attempt to leave the parcel with our facilities manager whose office is under the entrance arch .
neutral	when i rang up it was patently obvious that they much preferred the customer to drive to their depot and pick it up .
neutral	rubbish !
neutral	i tried to place an order at the weekend as 00_%_discount was offered but the place order box went out when i accepted the terms and condition `_s .
neutral	placed order on monday with no problem `_s .
neutral	good `_s arrived on friday well_packaged .
neutral	i still recommend ordering from d . b . f . as the item is of good quality , the site is easy to use and delivery time `_s are good .
neutral	david
neutral	work out a better system than standing in the rain in a que for 00_minutes to pick_up the pass .
neutral	the shipping needs approving .
neutral	i '_ve delt_with a lot of college book rentals sites , and it never took ten days to arrive
neutral	fair value for money but having to upload prescription every time for each drug prescribe thereon is tedious
neutral	i specifically rented from autoeurope because the site offered a decent price for a mercedes car ( or similar model ) at palermo airport .
neutral	oh , how important is that ' or similar '.
neutral	however , upon_arrival the rental_car company was clear that they never have mercedes cars at that location and i instead received a hyundai .
neutral	this was a very good car and at the end of my week touring sicily i was pleased with its performance , space and gas_mileage ; however it wasn_'_t what i had wanted to rent .
neutral	i appreciate that a specific brand of car cannot always be guaranteed but that is different from advertising a particular car type that is never available at that location , simply to hoodwink the punter .
neutral	i believe this has more to do specifically with the geneva hertz car_rental than with autoeurope , but i booked a mercedes a class or similar , and got a skoda octavia from the location .
neutral	there are no mercedes cars in that location as the hertz representative informed me , so i found the description misleading .
neutral	in addition , this hertz location has no late hours drop_off , since there is no parking in the vicinity , making it extremely inconvenient .
neutral	no_hidden_fees from autoeurope , and reservation was found without problem ( albeit with slow genevois service ).
neutral	only using the online system to place the order for a friend that was experiencing a hard time i placed my order for next_day delivery .
neutral	the appropriate moment to deliver .
neutral	over 00_hours_later was when i was informed of the banking holiday .
neutral	i also paid additional for next_day service which was never returned .
neutral	when using the calendar to choose my delivery date , days of non delivery where marked , sunday but not the bank_holiday .
neutral	it '_s a good site overall .
neutral	i found it easy to use .
neutral	however , the customer assistance part is lacking ... enthusiasm .
neutral	wrote a message because i could not upload my user pic into my profile ( also some kind of technical error on the website ).
neutral	that must have been a month_ago , at_least , and i '_ve yet to receive a reply .
neutral	also have been seeing some technical kinks with password / login , where i enter my details and they are not recongnized , so i have to reset my password everytime i need to login to my profile .
neutral	other than that , the site pretty_much carries out its main function which is to provide information on hostels around the world .
neutral	still , if you add additional features like profiles , some social_networking , etc .
neutral	make_sure they work well , or it mars the overall view of the site , in my opinion .
neutral	and do reply to messages as far as customer assistance is concerned .
neutral	i thought the bus_tour hit all the major highlights of the city but there were too many stops and there was a section that really was not too interesting and it seemed that the narrative was grasping to make comments about the area being driven through ...
neutral	i was rather dissapointed when i saw the condition of the shipping container especially since my order was for a pickup mirror .
neutral	package inside was just fine .
neutral	i '_m not sure why ups was dropped in in favor of the usps , in my hometown , but it added another day to the delivery schedule .
neutral	i used this service when 0 of us went to london .
neutral	when we landed from the flight over the driver was 00_minutes late and the car was too small to comfortably accommodate all of us and our_luggage .
neutral	i had to ride with a large suitcase on my lap .
neutral	when you sign_up for the service part of the process is to let them know how many people will be traveling and the amount of luggage you have .
neutral	the return trip to the airport was much_better .
neutral	the driver was on time and the vehicle was large enough to accommodate all of us .
neutral	quick and professional always
neutral	selve forsendelsen var_helt iorden men , kvalitaten af kostumerne kunne være bedre
neutral	i guess i thought boiler_juice was set_up to save customers money , but when you buy and pay one day and it gets delivered several days_later available at market prices somewhat lower ... then whats the point
neutral	i think it took a week before the order was actually dispatched .
neutral	i don_'_t recall seeing anything saying my lenses were out of stock or on back order .
neutral	previous_orders have been faster .
neutral	merlin had emailed some offers and i ordered the ultegra brakes which were at an unmissable price .
neutral	they arrived quickly - with merlin '_s usual efficient service - each caliper in a separate poly bag for protection .
neutral	so_far so good and no packaging - save the planet too !
neutral	but oops , no fitting_instructions .
neutral	i '_ve not put the calipers on my girlfriends bike yet until i get hold of some .
neutral	i '_ve used rose bikes for shimano kit on occasions - very low_prices , no boxes to re - cycle , post takes a bit_longer from germany but fitting_instructions included for each item .
neutral	result !
neutral	so come on merlin .
neutral	you sell great products at great prices but just need to go that extra_mile to avoid_disappointment .
neutral	my orders were shipped to me in a reasonable_amount of time .
neutral	my issue is with customer service , it is very bad and thats being nice !
neutral	if you are ordering a part and dont have a faulty or wrong part that needs to be returned , you shouldnt have an issue .
neutral	if you do have a return , you can only reach them through e_-_mail , which would be fine if it didn_'_t take a week or better for a response .
neutral	i caution to read the fine_print before ordering !
neutral	you will be responsible for all shipping_charges and be required to get a " rma " number and have within 00 days to return .
neutral	product not as_described in that it did not fit correctly .
neutral	nnnmmmmmmmm ty
neutral	no apology or statement about when coat may be available .
neutral	so 0 days after purchase just had email then card refunded a few_days_later .
neutral	one sad 00 year_old daughter !
neutral	i won_'_t be using boohoo again
neutral	wonder_why i paid for box shipping of a key blank ?
neutral	what '_s wrong with an envelope ?
neutral	arrived in a packed cardboard_box 00 "_x00 x 0 " ( my estimate )...
neutral	glad i got it but why send a 0 " key in a large box ?
neutral	good selection of bikes & kit , no after sales though as in bike service or monitoring maintenance .
neutral	great hotel to stay at if you ' re coming into vegas last_minute or looking for a good deal .
neutral	the only_thing that wasn_'_t good was that the air_conditioner was malfunctioning most of time with 000 degrees outside .
neutral	it finally got fixed the last night i was there .
neutral	so make_sure the ac is working and blowing cold_air first thing .
neutral	prices and gear are great , but i had some issues with the address verification system .
neutral	i entered my address using the post_office approved format and then other similar formats , and every time the address verification changed it .
neutral	from past experiences , had i used the shipping address chosen by the checkout system , i would not have received my package , so i had to have it sent to my office instead .
neutral	you should allow an option to override your address verification system if you know for a fact that your address is typed correctly .
neutral	i '_ve used boiler_juice many_times and it has_been 00 / 00 service - this time the attitude of the driver let them down !
neutral	the experience at the front_desk was good .
neutral	however , after getting the truck home i inspected it and noticed that although having been charged for valve_stems , the valve_stems were not replaced .
neutral	i also questioned whether the front_end alignment was correctly done because the technician alleged that the toe in and toe out needed adjustment .
neutral	it was clear by examining the adjustments for toe in and toe out that the nuts on the end of rack , there was no sign of having been touched from a wrench .
neutral	so , therefore , if i were ever to do_business with town_fair_tire again , i probably would keep a closer eye on the work being done in the shop .
neutral	i did call the dealer and talked to aaron on the phone about my concerns .
neutral	he claims that he is sure that the inside of the valve_stems were replaced , which of course is the part least likely to wear out .
neutral	the rubber on the outside is the part that would wear first .
neutral	they clearly did not replace the rubber part .
neutral	to get complete_satisfaction would have require me to get in the truck , drive 00 miles one way , to show aaron first hand what was done and what was not done .
neutral	i did not have the time to make the trip .
neutral	since the service had been done 0 hour earlier , i '_m guessing that aaron could have walked out to the shop to discuss with the person that did the work whether he had indeed replaced the valve_stems .
neutral	and , clearly if the technician had admitted that he had not replaced the valves , a credit could have been issued which would have helped satisfied me .
neutral	zelf heb_ik geen verstand van drukwerk en_het enige wat_ik wou was een pdf bestandje 0 : 0 laten drukken .
neutral	om dit voor elkaar te krijgen waren wel 0 telefoontjes en 00 mails nodig .
neutral	voor_een leek kreeg_ik allemaal vragen waar ik geen verstand van had over marges etc .
neutral	houd het simpel voor_mij , ik vroeg om 0 : 0 afdruk en regeen jullie dan de rest , vertel mij alleen wat het kost .
neutral	ondanks dat vond ik_de service uitstekend want jullie zaten er absoluut bovenop
neutral	i was exited with saving money hoping to have the full bold flavor of the nespresso coffee .
neutral	it is ok for the price saving but not ok for for was i was hoping for .
neutral	coffee tastes old and does not have the flavor i am looking for in an expresso coffee .
neutral	disapointment , i will not buy your coffee anymore .
neutral	i think the prices are good and the shipping is very fast .
neutral	i got my order in two_days .
neutral	what i did not like and what made me decide to not use parts_geek again is that they are totally unwilling to help if you make a mistake .
neutral	i accidentally ordered two items instead of one at $_000 each .
neutral	i realized i did it right after i hit the submit_button .
neutral	first thing i noticed was that no changes could be made to the order after t was submitted .
neutral	i can '_t call and cancel part of the order .
neutral	there is no reason for this .
neutral	now i have to make a return in which i will have to pay shipping and a restocking_fee .
neutral	that '_s a lot of wasted money .
neutral	there prices aren_'_t so great to keep me coming_back with the lack of customer service .
neutral	driver wasnt there when we arrived .
neutral	had to call service 0 times .
neutral	he finally showed_up and had our name spelled incorrectly on the placard .
neutral	a fine ride once we hooked up .
neutral	the driver said however that he wasnt with the company , they apparently had to call in a different service to provide our ride ?
neutral	?
neutral	great experience ....
neutral	too many lags and buffering when trying to use uk websites
neutral	excellent for free tips for all types of wedding speech
neutral	had 0 item missing from shipment .
neutral	overall the part i needed most was shipped and was a perfect replacement .
neutral	the customer service method used was a pain a phone_number would be nice so you could talk to a real_person about your problem .
neutral	i joined rebtel to call an israel landline which i call frequently .
neutral	the service just didn_'_t work for the first two_weeks or so .
neutral	as always fast delivery and easy transaction .
neutral	used the master start - up kit i received just like the instructions stated .
neutral	pool looks good , but i still after 0_weeks have foaming issues .
neutral	my only disappointment is when i called into the doheny support line they tried to sell me a de - foaming chemical .
neutral	otherwise i would have given 0_star_review .
neutral	although i am barely returning the defective jersey i ordered ( hopefully a reproduce comes back ) the jersey bibshort is good .
neutral	nice chamois .
neutral	fits good .
neutral	all you need to do is look at my last 0 orders and it tells the story .
neutral	evidentially , the conn valley cab that i ordered was not in so instead of sending what you had ( which you ultimately did ) your store held on to both orders .
neutral	it was not untill i called much later did i find that out .
neutral	i do not think you should advertise what you don_'_t have or what you can '_t get .
neutral	and that is what happened above !
neutral	i did receive a coupon for my inconvenience but would have preferred to get the wine on time !
neutral	... product arrived in a timely_manner .
neutral	it was exactly_what i had ordered , but even with the free shipping i paid 00_% more than i would have at my local nutritional store .
neutral	price , availablity , quality of parts , speed of processing order ... an a plus .
neutral	customer service , email follow - up , ability to find out order status , email_confirmation ... a c minus .
neutral	this survey is the first and only email i got from them , even_though i confirmed my email address twice with them !
neutral	their 0 - 000 number rings off the wall , they never pick_up the phone , nor tell you how long you '_ll wait to be served !
neutral	basic stuff guys !
neutral	partsgeek has great products and prices .
neutral	shipping , however , is very inconsistent as items are often dropped shipped from various_locations .
neutral	not in a position to give an onon , but am concrned abot the absence of bristles in the centreof thebrushhea
neutral	prices were great , shipping was fast .
neutral	unfortunately i was sent a box with the wrong part name , but the correct part number .
neutral	how do you contact partsgeek to find out if it is compatible , by email hell .
neutral	it took 0 days to get an answer to a 00 second question because they handle all customer service requests through a ticket system rather_than a telephone .
neutral	then i also noticed that if you have to send back their mistake you are responsible for shipping ?
neutral	so , make_sure you order the right thing the first time and hope like hell they don_'_t screw up your order , or it will be all your fault .
neutral	seemed like a brilliant idea , especially for someone short on time ... no more trips to selfridges to get the pods !
neutral	unfortunatly , although you may save about a £ 0 ... the quality of this coffee , is pretty poor in comparison to the nespresso ....
neutral	it just tastes very weak and watered down ... no different if you was to make a weak cafetiere coffee ...
neutral	have to say i am quite disappointed .... especially as i am now stuck with 000 pods !
neutral	the bumper valance color shown on your web_site was black , which is the color i needed .
neutral	when i got the valance it was a beige color which worked ok , but not what i expected .
neutral	i would have shipped it back if the shipping had been lower .
neutral	i suggest showing the available colors as a selection .
neutral	the new electric blower_motor i ordered was delivered punctually and was well_packaged with no signs og damage .
neutral	however , when i unpacked it , i noticed that the red plastic clip between the 0 terminals was broken - the packaging was fine so i suspect that it was actually despatched in a broken condition .
neutral	i called design 000 and explained what happened , emailed photos to them as requested and they swiftly arranged for a new electric motor to be sent to me with an arranged pick_up of the broken motor at the same time .
neutral	the new motor arrived in 0 days , was in the correct condition and the broken motor taken_away .
neutral	design000 dealt_with the problem quickly and efficiently and it will not stop me using them again .
neutral	paid for next_day delivery .
neutral	took 0 days ...
neutral	while i got my part in a timely_fashion it was the wrong part .
neutral	i am sending it back in hopes of getting the correct one
neutral	the product was great and the service delivery was great how ever after ordering after getting mail to say order anything with a promo_code and this was free_postage , got charged for the postage and when enquired was informed this was only if you order on a 0 day delay , so moral of the story always read the fine_print
neutral	i filled_out the questionaire about my car and what part i needed .
neutral	the screen displayed an item which i ordered .
neutral	about 0 hours_later i was looking for other parts and noted the item i ordered was for a different engine size ( which had not been asked for in the questionaire ).
neutral	i promptly filled_out their support_ticket form and stated the obvious - i ordered this and need that - simple .
neutral	but not really because they will not stop the order and replace with the correct number .
neutral	you have to wait_until you receive the wrong part , wait for an_rma ( return merchandise authorization_number ) then send the wrong part back at your expense .
neutral	they charge a 00_% restocking_fee plus your shipping means on a $_000 order , you have lost $_00 because they cannot stop an order and change anything .
neutral	i '_ve ordered three cd_keys from these_guys .
neutral	they don_'_t make their hours of operation visible .
neutral	i ordered these keys around 0 :_00pm mst only to find out that their hours of operation are 0am - 0pm gmt .
neutral	the reason i purchased these keys was so that i could play the game with some friends that night .
neutral	the keys didn_'_t end up coming until 0 :_00am the next_day .
neutral	keys work perfect though .
neutral	i placed my order and within a day i was told my payment was accepted and a shipment email was to follow .
neutral	i waited for 0 day and packages started arriving .
neutral	i just was not ready with the tools i needed when the parts arrived .
neutral	all parts arrived within a week of ordering them .
neutral	my wife was very pleased to receive the flowers for our_anniversary but was surprised to get a call then have to go looking for the delivery van as they could not find the address .
neutral	we live in the countryside and the van_driver got totally lost !
neutral	tennis_racket ordered and delivered safely in quick time .
neutral	thank_you for that .
neutral	i had a knock with it last saturday and weight and balance felt good .
neutral	i was disappointed with the stringing and will have to get it restrung to suit which is a disappointment considering the cost of the racket .
neutral	john wright .
neutral	i would describe the website user experience as basic , although by no means bad .
neutral	i have no problem with basic but as with everything in life , it could be improved .
neutral	i would recommend having someone that specialises in web user_interface or web user experience to take a look at how the flow can be improved and how management of accounts and bids could be consolidated into a single page , perhaps with wish_list functionality , sidebars , or better use of ' watch this bid ' - listing all available bids on a single page , or allowing to sort into tab , list or ' file ' type format
neutral	the concept of auto bidding was not entirely clear to me from the information on the website although i used common_sense to work that out
neutral	one complaint i have is that i wasn_'_t made clearly aware ( ie , pretend i dont read small_print ) about the auction charges and shipping cost .
neutral	customers should read small_print but they dont and then they get upset when things in the small_print impact them - from a customer experience point of view , just be up front with that and it will provide a better experience
neutral	your shipping cost is too high vs . what i would expect from retail_outlet .
neutral	it seems like you are ripping me off a bit there .
neutral	thats actually the most_likely thing to make me think_twice .
neutral	the shipping makes buying some bottle prohibitive , i ' d say .
neutral	i work in ecommerce payments , so from the point of view of a £ 0 charge up front - i understand_why you do it , fraud checks and validity and so on - i can '_t say it encourages customers to sign_up in droves .
neutral	more customers = more potential_buyers .
neutral	you should investigate ' account inquiry ' transactions also known as ' zero value auth '.
neutral	they do what the £ 0 transaction does but without charging £ 0 .
neutral	ask your acquirer about these , they might support them .
neutral	so , summary - i will_definitely shop again because i got great whisky but i will do so feeling i have learned a few lessons , which means improvement is certainly possible as really i should not have to purchase in order to learn .
neutral	you have a fine selection of whisky though and as i say , i will_definitely shop again .
neutral	hopefully my criticism is constructive !
neutral	thanks ,
neutral	joe
neutral	all went well came back earlier without problem ; the only problem with dfds is infrequent service
neutral	good showroom , great value and smooth delivery process when ordering of the web but when we had to exchange some tiles at the warehouse it was woefully understaffed and involved a wait of around an_hour .
neutral	so_far so good , ink_cartridges seem to work just fine .
neutral	one thing i would like to know .
neutral	is there anything to do with the empties ?
neutral	i am generally pleased with the service from boiler_juice but that last few_times i '_ve placed an order , i was not called to be told when to expect delivery .
neutral	instead , the delivery truck arrives without_any warning .
neutral	this is very inconvenient and not want is promised with the service .
neutral	price and delivery was ok but having to sign_up with a password and give over my email is a pain .
neutral	you will get spammy requests to fill in rubbish like this !!
neutral	!
neutral	i sold three phones - one i got the full price for but the other two were drastically reduced claiming one was water damged and the other had a faulty lcd .
neutral	i opted to have the two phones returned .
neutral	on examination i discovered that on both phones the batteries were flat ( probably due to exposure to the extremely cold_weather at the time ).
neutral	i simply charged the phones and both immediately worked - i would have thought envirophone could have worked this out for themselves .
neutral	with the super_saver it took over 0_weeks to get my item , and it was a little lens cap for a dslr !!
neutral	so sad
neutral	i bought a printer from 0000rpm and was really impressed by the price ( the lowest i could find ) and by the very prompt service .
neutral	the only_thing i didn_'_t like was that they had opened the box , removed the epson starter ink_cartridges which should have been included , and replaced them with cheaper generic replacement cartridges .
neutral	presumably they did this so that they could sell the original ink separately ( or maybe it '_s a refurb , although that certainly wasn_'_t indicated on the site ).
neutral	i '_ve bought exactly the same printer before elsewhere and know that you should get official epson cartridges .
neutral	i thought about returning it , but didn_'_t want the hassle and the replacement carts should work well enough .
neutral	i suspect that epson would not be happy about this practice though ( and i do wonder about the implications for the guarantee ).
neutral	as others have stated over and over again , wix is buggy as hell .
neutral	i created a whole website already for a roller derby team and now i '_m worried_about the site even loading and working correctly .
neutral	# 0 ...
neutral	some days your published website will load fast ... then an_hour later it can sit and not load .
neutral	usually you will see your browser waiting on " waiting for static . wix . com ".
neutral	then they will give the same dead response they give to everyone ... clear your cache , history , bla_bla_bla ... it '_s your fault not ours .
neutral	# 0 ...
neutral	the web editor !
neutral	i would need 00 people if i wanted to count on hands how many_times i '_ve sat with the web editor loading ... loading ... loading ... and it never loads .
neutral	i '_ve refreshed , cleared cache , closed browser , pounded on my desk , jumped around , gone to the bathroom for a really long time and then came back ... still no web editor .
neutral	# 0 ...
neutral	mobile .
neutral	i have yet to be able to set_up the mobile design for the website i am working on .
neutral	on all 0 browsers and on my home computer , i get the same message : " could not load .
neutral	please try again later ."
neutral	hey wix ...
neutral	i did ...
neutral	i really did try again later ... many_times .
neutral	it '_s not my computer , it '_s not my browser ... it '_s your site .
neutral	i am on a nearly new 00 " imac with updated safari , firefox , and chrome .
neutral	same results in all browsers .
neutral	yet the wix support crew still give myself and all the others the same brain - dead responses ... duh ... must be your computer / browser .
neutral	the positive ???
neutral	well , when it all works correctly , it really allows you to do most anything as a website designer .
neutral	the page transitions are a nice modern feature .
neutral	seo seems to be pretty good as well .
neutral	just be warned , if you are looking to do a site in a timely_manner , or have one that a client can go in and edit later ... wix is a toss - up .
neutral	i know it says it is in beta right now ... but when are they going to fix all these issues already ?
neutral	when i go into their support forums , the same old questions have been being asked for over a year already .
neutral	fix it .
neutral	dude !
neutral	wheres my stuff ?
neutral	as pensioners we found the unpacking and setting_up of the welsh dresser challenging .
neutral	we had to find a way of lifting the top half inch by inch on blocks of wood , from floor level to the level of the base unit then slide it across .
neutral	disposing of the cardboard and polystyrene meant an_hour '_s round_trip to the recycling centre .
neutral	would gladly have parted with an extra twenty quid for the delivery guys to help , and to take the packing away , but they were in a tearing hurry .
neutral	secondly , there are a few woodworm holes here and there .
neutral	are they alive or not ?
neutral	time will tell .
neutral	great bargains on new gsm phones but the shipping prices are very high so i use n0wireless as my last_resort because it defeats the purpose of spending less .
neutral	also when there is something wrong with the phone or you return the package , you are not reimbursed for the shipping and that irritates a lot .
neutral	part of our last regular order did not arrive .
neutral	i contacted customer service and was told they would try to track it down , or ship the missing items again .
neutral	that was over a week_ago .
neutral	i was told it would take a couple of days to do the tracking and they would contact me again .
neutral	i contacted them again and have not received any response .
neutral	i called again and they did not have any documentation of my email , but did have the communication to the shipper .
neutral	there had been no response from the shipper , and i guess i would have just been in limbo if i had not called again .
neutral	i have been a loyal_customer for 0 - 0 years , and spend a lot of money with this company .
neutral	i would have expected better customer service , however , when i called again the customer service rep was very apologetic and did the the undelivered order shipped out the next_day .
neutral	that '_s the only saving_grace to this order .
neutral	i '_m not sure if i will_continue my auto ship with them or not because i am disappointed with their initial response .
neutral	i '_m going to have to think about it .
neutral	the purchasing process was a breeze and the parts were delivered in a timely_manor , the only_downside was the parts are seconds .
neutral	the tail_light i got had the mounting_holes drilled off center .
neutral	me and my buddy both ordered 00 roses for our girls through florist . co . uk
neutral	my girl received roses with a whole bunch of white flowers too , which - fortunately - she_loved !
neutral	his girlfriend received white lilies , which is one of the most stupid , unacceptable and bizarre things i can imagine on valentines_day ..
neutral	that '_s right .
neutral	they delivered a flower associated with funerals , to a girl expecting roses .
neutral	what a joke !
neutral	i was very lucky - he was spitting razorblades .
neutral	i certainly won_'_t chance it again - back to interflora !
neutral	great price on parts but if you are in a hurry to fix what you are working on go to the local parts store .
neutral	i waited a week for my parts .
neutral	i generally have no problem with my order , however i have been waiting 0_weeks and no appointment cards , yet ?
neutral	also e_-_mail response to correct dr . but with incorrect person addressed .
neutral	confusion at our end , since we al three dr .' s order from this company !
neutral	every time i order something i have to fill in all my information .... name , address , phone_number , email address .
neutral	some time ago the information was automatically filled in , however , it was an old address and i needed to correct it each time .
neutral	now , nothing appears .
neutral	i order 0 to 0 times per_month and it is frustrating to have to fill in my complete information each time .... enough to make me want to order somewhere_else where they maintain and provide the information .
neutral	i ordered two packs of four inks , 000xl .
neutral	a yellow arrived alone with no_explanation of where the remainder of the order was .
neutral	a few_days_later the full order arrived .
neutral	no_explanation of the separation or delay .
neutral	i had contacted hp between times ; the reply was they had ckecked that my order was being dispatched .
neutral	i have a $_000 b_&_h gift_card and was making a purchase for $_000 and your site would not let_me use the card because it was less that the amount !
neutral	!
neutral	my experience would have been a lot higher if they had sent the right parts .
neutral	i had ordered rear coil_springs , rear_struts , and rear top - mount bracket '_s .
neutral	everything was okay except for the struts they where for the front not the back .
neutral	i had to pick some up locally .
neutral	i '_ve decided to keep the strut '_s to use later .
neutral	instead of the hassle of returning them .
neutral	i like the deals offered , and the website [ when it works ] is generally easy to use .
neutral	there are some issues i have with the website though .
neutral	sometimes when i '_ve clicked deal emails , the coupons don_'_t get added to my final tab , unless i log out and log in again and do everything over .
neutral	also , the website doesn_'_t let_me make half and half pizzas [ although that might be the pizza place i use , nyc pizza factory ]
neutral	good parts but i expect to receive parts when they say so , not when the parts show up .
neutral	for example they say 0 to 0 days and 0 / 0 of the parts show and the rest of order shows up 0 days_later and with no e_-_mail to say this i don_'_t know if i will be doing_business like that .
neutral	i called in to make hotel reservation thinking i was speaking with the hotel_directly .
neutral	they asked for a cr card number to hold room but the charge appeared on my card this morning !
neutral	this is totally_unacceptable as they never told me they were getting a prepaid reservation .
neutral	they should of only had this pending until we checked out as this is the policy of hotels .
neutral	i have contacted the mgmt of this hotel to file a complaint .
neutral	the charge was not authorized nor was i informed they were going to do this .
neutral	alan friend
neutral	the order was received quickly but did not include all parts .
neutral	customer service is only via an e_-_mail address - don_'_t expect to ever talk to a human .
neutral	partgeek customer service answers e_-_mail every 0 days so don_'_t expect quick response here .
neutral	first response from partsgeek did not understand which part was missing -- even_though i attached the packing_slip which clearly showed the missing part .
neutral	a follow_up e_-_mail to partsgeek resulted_in the missing part being shipped but without communication from partsgeek .
neutral	i would be reluctant to do_business with partsgeek again .
neutral	it was very easy to connect and rent the car we needed , however , locations of the rental centers and the return places are not easy to find and of course , there is a language_barrier as well .
neutral	the first salesman was too worried_about getting off on time but amy took real good care of me .
neutral	as far as the vehicle we are still having problems with the starter and now the dealer wants it for a day to see if they can figure it out so hopefully it will be squared_away early next week
neutral	parts arrived sooner_than_expected in good condition .
neutral	no disclosure was made at the time of purchase regarding their core refund policy .
neutral	there '_s a 00 day wait for the refund and the part must be shipped in the ' original ' box .
neutral	i had to pay for the return shipping ( plus insured ) which reduced my core refund from $_00 to $_00 .
neutral	these expenses must taken into account when shopping for prices .
neutral	core refund policy needs an overhaul .
neutral	i went online to order a winter_cover and while i was at it i ordered some extra supplies .
neutral	those came in very quickly but main thing is still on backorder ?
neutral	too slow at pick - up .
neutral	was pleased with the product but feel the overall process could be better .
neutral	there was no faster shipping options offered , and i felt processing was a little_slow .
neutral	i will still utilize them in the future as i was pleased with the end product .
neutral	i have been using the three free sites for a while , i finally_decided to get " real " credit_monitoring .
neutral	as far as i can tell , it '_s mostly the same as the free sites .
neutral	i get updates in my email the same time from all the websites .
neutral	i was also hoping to view my fico score , and not another " our best guess " score .
neutral	the free sites at_least update their version of my credit_score more frequently .
neutral	i also have a hard time logging in .
neutral	not all the time , but sometimes i have to put my username and password in 00 + times before i '_m actually taken to the members area .
neutral	we enjoyed the trip very much --- unfortunately , we scratched the front_bumper .
neutral	i had zero deductible_insurance which was recommended for drivers used to driving with left_hand drive cars .
neutral	we were charged 00 pounds on our credit_card .
neutral	i said --" we have insurance " she said -- no matter -- deal with autoeur in the us .
neutral	i called and they said we shouldn_'_t have been charged .
neutral	time to get some acts together .
neutral	need to get website updated to pay with credit_card ... it shows the visa and mastercard symbol , but does not give that as an option for payment
neutral	we ordered and promptly received ten cocktail sticks - unfortunately , one was broken .
neutral	it did appear that the breakage was caused_by the post_office handlers , rather_than faulty goods ............... the packaging looked like it had gone_through a grinder !
neutral	all other 0 cocktail sticks were perfect , and are being put to good use !
neutral	imagine that you are in a city filled with foreign speaking strangers and you are trying to find out where to pick_up / drop_off a vehicle .
neutral	it can be a real challenge .
neutral	thus , i recommend a better way to identify the locations of the rental spots .
neutral	the vehicle itself was quite fine with the exception of very thin tires ( needing replacement ).
neutral	great product , great deal , but why make me queue up for 00_minutes in the post_office to collect the package !!
neutral	if you would ship to an address other than the one on the credit_card it would have been 0_stars !
neutral	think it '_s time to find a more flexible merchant bank ....
neutral	the shipping is great .
neutral	very fast .
neutral	but my problem is the package came in boxes with terrible padding .
neutral	i ordered left and right headlights for my 0000 lumina and one of the lights was broken .
neutral	the support peice that snaps and holds the light in place on the car was snapped in half .
neutral	this is clearly because of the 0 skinny , useless pieces of foam used inside the box it was shipped in .
neutral	i can reuse the peice from the original lights , but this is still unacceptable .
neutral	i don_'_t know if i could have avoided a lot of the trouble i had just opening and using this program , but it certainly would have prepared me better if i had known that your programs are all written for win xp .
neutral	i only have win0 home edition and was not able to open or register your program .
neutral	rather_than coughing up another $_00 .
neutral	i located an old laptop from a friend and proceeded to load and open the programs thru it .
neutral	of course i had to jump thru the hoops of cut & paste to put the registration and activation process on my other computer , which has internet capability , before i could open the program on the laptop .
neutral	why on earth haven_'_t you converted those manuals into adobe pdf files , and save the world from all that archaic software headaches ??
neutral	?
neutral	just a thought !
neutral	!
neutral	i ordered from echo once before and had a great service .
neutral	my second order however was not so great .
neutral	i ordered on friday , my order was over 0kg in weight and i topped up my order to over £_00 to get the next_day delivery .
neutral	several days when by and i still hadn_'_t received any order confirmation from echo or the distributor regarding my order even_though payment had been taken .
neutral	i emailed echo on their info @ address and received no reply .
neutral	i then called echo and before they would checking the details of my order , they were trying to suggest the problem was at my end , that i either hadn_'_t placed the order properly and when i explained i ordered through paypal and had a paypal receipt they were saying it might be that my address is not confirmed ( which it is ), only after debunking the excuses did they then look up .
neutral	they saw my order had been made but they hadn_'_t dispatched it and didn_'_t know why my order hadn_'_t been dispatched , they apologised and said they would dispatch it and i would receive it the next_day ( thursday ).
neutral	so i waited a week for an order which should have been " next_day ".
neutral	there was no offer of refund or recompense ( perhaps a few extra free_samples ) for having in effect paid for next_day delivery and not received it , or for having to wait a week and chasing the order myself .
neutral	if i hadn_'_t chased it i would still be waiting now .
neutral	i ran_out of whey due to the delay .
neutral	the products did eventually arrived the next_day , albeit a week late .
neutral	my first order with echo was smooth , the second not so , so it '_s hard to know which level of service is the norm .
neutral	i '_ll have to see how i feel when i come to re - order whether to give echo another try or return to my previous_supplier .
neutral	we have used boilerjuice again this year .
neutral	price seemed reasonable compared with others checked .
neutral	delivery was more rapid than_expected but could have been a problem as no - one rang us beforehand to check we would be in , despite it being on the request and the driver '_s delivery sheet .
neutral	hope next time someone will read the request and act on it .
neutral	i am really tired of non_- negotiable fees being tacked on after purchace .
neutral	fine_print not withstanding , it is simply dishonest marketing .
neutral	i would really expect my agent to address that problem by insisting that all lugage or other fees be includeed up front in price quotes and charges , instead of coluding with airlines to hide them .
neutral	simply ask me how many bags i would like to pay for when i make the reservation , and discount or add to the initial price so it is accurate .
neutral	they had a promotion to pay for the rest of may and to get june for free .
neutral	but they made me pay for the month of july in full and i wasnt told i would have to pay that up front .
neutral	the part i ordered was the part i received and the price was good but the shipping was really slow .
neutral	i was told 0 to 0 days and it took all of that .
neutral	ordered on saturday and i received it tuesday of the next week .
neutral	next time i might pay for priority shipping .
neutral	with summit_racing they say 0 to 0 days shipping and i usually get it in 0 days .
neutral	otherwise everything else was satisfactory .
neutral	box was beat up charger dented
neutral	i received a card with a purchase that had a promo_code i could use if my order was more than $_00 .
neutral	i purchased a leaf net , then tried to use the promo_code , but it kept saying the code was invalid .
neutral	not too upset about , but don_'_t send me this if you ' re not going to accept it .
neutral	parts came quickly , condensor and o - rings did the trick .
neutral	the tensioner pulley when installed seized and toasted the drive belt .
neutral	item made in china and something was not right .
neutral	threw it in the trash and re - installed old tensioner pulley after lubing it ..
neutral	it appears that the plastic was larger than the bearing and when installed did not allow pulley free movement .
neutral	not happy as i had to jack up engine after undoing engine_mount to get tensioner bolt out .
neutral	so i did it twice .
neutral	we have received 0 orders from pet - supermarket ( 0 order sent as a goodwill_gesture for damaged packaging on previous order ).
neutral	our experience when dealing_with pet - supermarket has_been good .
neutral	however , the service provided by their carrier is very poor .
neutral	goods have arrived much later on each order than originally promised .
neutral	packaging was damged on one order which was left on front doorstep without taking a signature as proof of delivery .
neutral	dog_food spilt all over front path .
neutral	last order the dog_food was packaged much_better_than previous_orders , however the good still arrived later than promised .
neutral	in future will not use pet - supermarket to order dog_food in bulk unless the delivery service improves .
neutral	we left our honda fit for 0 days while we went to california .
neutral	the shuttle was there and got us to our flight in about 00 min .
neutral	we arrived at 0000pm and called the shuttle they were waiting for us and took us right back .
neutral	the staff was courteous and helpful when they brought our car the time on the radio was blinking , we thought there was about an eight of a tank , we knew it was low but the meter read dead empty .
neutral	the total mileage on the odometer , we always leave it on average gal per mile .
neutral	the gas we could of been mistaken , but the only way the clock blinks and you have to enter a code to get the radio is if the battery is dead or someone tries to disabled the radio .
neutral	things were just not right with the car .
neutral	now we have to find the code to enable the radio or replace it .
neutral	i use jalbum to put up quick temporary sites of photos i '_ve taken at an event or on a studio shoot .
neutral	the skin i use is turtle , and turtle is the only reason i bought jalbum .
neutral	the turtle skin is a bit buggy and could be more intuitive .
neutral	bugs :
neutral	0 ) consistency in saving projects - i have a folder user / sites / jalbum .
neutral	i want all projects to be stored in that folder with each project to be self contained in it '_s own folder , and i want each project to remember were it is stored and the skin settings .
neutral	i have not been able to achieve this after countless_hours of trying .
neutral	jalbum keeps creating a new jalbum folders holding just one project .
neutral	i didn_'_t think it was possible , but i have several folders named jalbum in my sites folder .
neutral	0 ) thumbnail layout - this option in the album setting does not work .
neutral	the only way i been able to get fewer than 0 columns is to change the " theme image size ", but then i have a skinny page .
neutral	0 ) top banner - consistency is important to me .
neutral	it would be nice to be able to have the same banner for all projects , albums , and sub - albums , and then have gallery title & comments under that banner and not on top of it .
neutral	i hope this helps .
neutral	i would really like jalbum to do well .
neutral	thanks ,
neutral	dave
neutral	the part i ordered was for 0000_tahoe , the part i got was for 0000 - 0000 .
neutral	it was a mirror , it fit but the plug did not match .
neutral	other than that , service was fine .
neutral	i use 0password to autofill address and credit_card information .
neutral	when i tried to use it on this site something went horribly wrong -- fields were filled incorrectly , and then i couldn_'_t select them to edit .
neutral	i had to quit the browser and reconnect .
neutral	happened with 0 different browsers ( chrome and safari ).
neutral	i feel after looking through other_sites this skin was over priced , my partner bought one from e_- bay which was cheaper and seemed to be better quality .
neutral	the correct part arrived as scheduled but was damaged , i was able to make it work as i did not have time to send back and wait for a replacement part .
neutral	partsgeek '_s inventory ( or access to inventory ) enabled_me to obtain all of my front_end auto_parts ( belts , pulleys , tensioners ) from one source .
neutral	local_auto_parts stores either couldn_'_t obtain portions of all of the parts i needed or required 0 week for drop shipment .
neutral	so_far , i am pleased with the partsgeek as an autoparts resource , and i purchased my parts for several 00 '_s of dollars less_than from local retailers .
neutral	i did obtain a blower_fan from partsgeek that was packaged as a box - in - a - box .
neutral	the inner box was re - taped over the authentic bmw tape .
neutral	sure , enough , one of the blower vanes was broken !
neutral	fortunately , i was able to replace the broken vane with one from the old unit ( very fortunate ).
neutral	i was reluctant to engage in any type of exchange or return of the damaged part , after_reading the tome of information and tight stipulations on returns to partsgeek .
neutral	moreover , i did not want to delay my repair for the time it would take to return and receive another part .
neutral	in addition , i could not get through by phone ( the fastest form of communication in my opinion ).
neutral	this was already an indication that i needed to come up with a workaround if i wanted to complete my blower_motor repair ( which required a complete dash removal ).
neutral	i knew sky_tours days ago , i deny that the prices were good , after i bought the ticket , there is nothing asking about passport or any verification .
neutral	the eticket was not issued for a day after the payment .
neutral	then when i opened a ticket i request to cancel the ticket and when i '_ll get the refund , they mentioned 0 or 0 days .
neutral	now it '_s more than 0 days and i didn_'_t get anything .
neutral	the support replying very late , today i sent three_times no one replied !
neutral	!
neutral	the time in the support portal is not correct , i know about the time difference , but even i wrote a reply after another one with a prior time !!!!
neutral	!
neutral	the quickness between ordering the part and receiving it was commendable .
neutral	however , the part , though supposedly for my car , did not fit .
neutral	i ended_up having to buy it from the dealership after all .
neutral	somewhat disappointing .
neutral	parts were little high & had to pay shipping .
neutral	very satisfied but one small problem need to return something i can '_t get threw no one please call me 000 - 000 - 0000 i dont_know another way
neutral	i ordered 0 new window crank handles for a chevy_truck .
neutral	for the same truck , i would normally want 0 identical handles :) these did work , they were just slightly_different .
neutral	i would have liked 0 of the one make or 0 of the other , not 0 and 0 .
neutral	i will think_twice about doing a rental_car again through travelocity .
neutral	i expect a car to be available when reserved .
neutral	timelines need to be met .
neutral	long waiting - i still have not recived the items i ordered 00th_december .
neutral	rang at 00 . 00 am for them to collect car at_gatwick n . i arrived at airport at 0 . 00 , didnt take as long as expected .
neutral	guy finally showed at 0 . 00 am - no apology .
neutral	disappointed in having too jump_through security hoops and so called forgot password nonsense and waste of my time when b_&_h no loner has any of my account info .
neutral	the product looks to be made very well .
neutral	but to those_who are not mechanically_inclined as others ' instructions would '_ve been nice as well as the bolts that actually connected to the frame if they ' re not existed .
neutral	the replacement pump came very quickly and looked like a quick pop - in installation .
neutral	but the pump electrical_connector was different than the connector supplied on my car .
neutral	after an_hour of putzing around with re - splicing connector wires and sealing it up with goop , it popped into the washer reservoir quickly and works_perfectly .
neutral	everywhere i checked for the correct part number came up with the same trico number for my car , but it sure didn_'_t match my electrical_connector .
neutral	oh well .
neutral	got ' er done !
neutral	on one day ... the books i was looking to sell were of a great price ..... 0 days_later when i went back to the site ... the books were at a much less value
neutral	the item wa delivered to my work address .
neutral	it was sent without my name and therefore was left for an age in our mail room until someone called design 000 to ask who had bought it .
neutral	works good for first booking .
neutral	the problem starts when you have to change flight tickets or do cancellations .
neutral	the information is there , but there is no option to do it on line .
neutral	please look into this part too .
neutral	you need to focus on " after sale " experience too .
neutral	thank_you .
neutral	purchased suspension parts built by " doorman " who '_s name , in my opinion , is aligned with quality .
neutral	the parts were built in china , looked great , but fasteners in the assemblies were not tightened ... lucky i checked or my wife would have been stranded with the front_end a wacked ....
neutral	i was also surprised by the package that was shipped .... parts were ordered at the same time , first one box showed_up , it was huge with lots of air space ... i figured both would be in that box but they weren_'_t .... next_day the other showed_up in a small box ... they both certainly could have been shipped together in the same box .... at_least i only had to pay one shipping cost ...
neutral	otherwise everything was good in the end .
neutral	good quality furniture at attractive price and excellent service .
neutral	unfortunately , we discovered a flaw in the upper part of the dresser - a section of the wood was split and had been repaired with a pin apparently in your workshop .
neutral	it was only when we lifted it into place that we discovered the fault ., unfortunately , we only discovered it a few_days after it was delivered and not within 00_hours . as a result we are unlikely to make any future_purchases from you or recommend you to other members of the family
neutral	it '_s ok i guess .... however the second time around they would not approve me , i had to go with emergencymoneyloans . com instead ..... which did approve me .
neutral	would of been nice if acecashexpress . com approved me the second time around since they did once before and didn_'_t have any_issues with that one .
neutral	the good : i had ordered two disk drives .
neutral	their prices were a bit higher_than another distributor but the free shipping more than compensated for the difference .
neutral	the order was placed on backorder and were shipped within 0 working days .
neutral	overall the time between ordering and receipt was less_than a week .
neutral	pretty good .
neutral	the bad : our spam_filter uses " greylisting " to block unwanted email .
neutral	it does this by delaying receipt of senders not recognized .
neutral	normal senders resend withing a couple of minutes ; spam senders do not .
neutral	drivesolutions ' mail server acted_like a spammer and never attempted to resend the confirmation_email .
neutral	the ugly : i called drivesolutions 0 times leaving a message each time requesting confirmation of the order .
neutral	no response .
neutral	the 0th time i got lucky and connected with a human who very polite and helpful .
neutral	rewards credit did not show up when i placed my order .
neutral	i had to to through an extended exchange with support to get this thing right .
neutral	should have worked better .
neutral	i usually like buying from b_&_h but this was a sour experience .
neutral	i ordered the panasonic_lumix g0 which arrived in the stated time and i am very happy with the camera model .
neutral	there were two issues however .
neutral	the first was that the lens protector was not in the box .
neutral	a quick contact sorted this so i was more than pleased .
neutral	the second was in the description of the camera .
neutral	the camera was class a which_meant it was a good price and it stated the camera was pristine with all parts but the box may be damaged .
neutral	the camera on arrival had quite a few signs of wear and the base had plastic damage related to tripod use .
neutral	the camera had clearly been used extensively in shop or returned .
neutral	i have kept the camera as it was what i needed and the price was good but i am unsure if i would used parks again , and definitely not for anything but completely new / unused .
neutral	uhh perhaps partsgeek needs to work on their operating_system .
neutral	i received 0 emails from partsgeek in a matter of hours .
neutral	the first email was a thank_you about my order , january 00 .
neutral	the second email was to say the item was on back - order and my payment was refunded , january 00 am .
neutral	no problem so_far , i completely understand , cannot_complain , and appreciate the speedy notification .
neutral	then a third email shows up saying your payment has_been approved , january 00 about an_hour after the back - order email .
neutral	now on feb . 0 i receive an_email_asking to me to review my partsgeek order .
neutral	????
neutral	up until the third email i had nothing to complain_about , but this is a bit ridiculous .
neutral	ordered a round pillow in hopes of filling the void in my neck while sleeping .
neutral	received it in fair amount of time .
neutral	really dissappointed , because the pillow was as hard as a log .
neutral	only took me 0 minutes to find it would never work .
neutral	as a matter of fact , it made my neck feel extra pain which i do not need .. just one more pillow for decoration .
neutral	thought it would be filled with wheat shaff or granular material , that would conform to my neck and mattress or chair .
neutral	tried placing this order since wednesday , i didn_'_t like that the checkout was unavailable then took 0 days to be able to place my order , never saw anything like this .
neutral	very inconvenient otherwise easy to navigate the website and good prices .
neutral	i bought a one - way ticket to panama_city , panama and was not told until my son got to the airport 0 hours before my flight that he needed proof he was leaving the country within 0 months .
neutral	as a specialist in travel , a one - way ticket to a foreign_country should have at_least generated a " checks and balances " questionnaire asking if the traveler was a resident of panama and if not , alerted me to the fact i needed to provide proof he was leaving .
neutral	i was able to purchase a ticket leaving panama , allowing him to board the plane - 00_minutes before they closed the door .
neutral	not a pleasant_experience .
neutral	i have used autoeurope before and it has_been great - i love the concept of a voucher that covers everything so you aren_'_t trying to decipher what is required and what is a con when you get to the rental_counter .
neutral	however , on this occasion it did not play out this way .
neutral	i was given a voucher for dollar rent - a - car at lax .
neutral	i arrived quite early in the morning at the dollar branch and had to wait 00_minutes ( no exaggeration !
neutral	and the line only got longer for the people who arrived after me ) before being served .
neutral	once i was served , the lady asked me to sign an agreement stating i was up for fees that almost totalled what i had already paid to autoeurope for an ' all_inclusive ' voucher .
neutral	when i questioned it , i was told they were mandatory .
neutral	i had to argue that the voucher already included all the add -_ons i wanted and i had no interest in the additional insurances she had tagged on , which included road - side assistance and break / enter protection .
neutral	after a lot of objecting she took these off , but insisted i still needed to pre_- pay a tank of gas at a ridiculous rate ($_00 ... after filling the tank myself i found it cost just $_00 to fill it from empty ).
neutral	i continued to object as the voucher clearly_stated pre_- pay fuel was optional .
neutral	i was directed to a manager who told me dollar '_s agreement with autoeurope was that renters needed to prepay a tank of gas from dollar .
neutral	i showed her what the voucher said , and told her she needed to take it up with autoeurope but as far as i was concerned , i wanted the agreement i had in front of me honoured .
neutral	she eventually agreed to this .
neutral	the car i had requested was not available ( jeep_grand cheroke ) and instead was given a jeep larado - same shape vehicle but a much_lower spec ' d option .
neutral	when i drove the car at over 00mph it shuddered and shook so violently it felt completely unsafe and unroadworthy .
neutral	i took it back - to their credit , dollar made this process relatively easy , however no more cars in this class were available so i was offered a standard sedan instead with no refund of the difference .
neutral	eventually i was able to talk them into giving me a convertible which was a nice car , but not really want i had wanted for the trip as i needed to transport skis and snowboards - but we managed .
neutral	overall , i would never voluntarily rent with dollar again .
neutral	i think autoeurope need to consider whether they are a rental partner they should be working with given how bad they are .
neutral	i ordered a pair of addidas tennis socks on line from the tennis section when they arrived they where marked on the packaging as a running sock and not a tennis sock as_advertised . i rang tennis_nuts to complain_about the incorrect description on there site , they seemed to be surprised as to my complaint . i needed the socks so they agreed end to refund my postage .
neutral	i have now been contacted by bikes0udirect and they have exhonerated themselves by replacing the faulty wheel .
neutral	will order my next bike here
neutral	i received the bike for my son with the back derailer bent ( can happen ) rang them and then replaced the bike .
neutral	the replacement bike has a buckled front_wheel which make the disc_brake rub .
neutral	i '_ve have written to them now 0 time and have not had a response .
neutral	my mornings tend to be very busy so it is difficult for me to ring them before 00 so hence have had to rely_on email .
neutral	i bought from them a couple of times now and the service is good and the prices are good .
neutral	the website is easy to navigate , but the communication as to whether your goods have been dispatched or not is non_- existent .
neutral	i bought a pair of grey espadrilles and after wearing them on and off for only 0_weeks , the soles are peeling away badly on both feet .
neutral	poor craftsmanship .
neutral	g & s was a company i had never used before , and since they ' re a relatively new company , i was concerned_about placing a large order with them .
neutral	i researched online , found nothing but positive_feedback and a high bbb rating , and so placed my order .
neutral	i received a call from a representative to confirm the receipt of my check , and the said order arrived in a timely_manner exactly as outlined by the company .
neutral	the only reason i am giving 0_stars ( 0 on everything else ) is the red box that they packed the coins with was not strong_enough to hold the heavy plastic containers of coins , and the end ripped out .
neutral	it was if the box was old or not designed to hold the weights they were packing in it , and had lost some of its integrity on the seams .
neutral	if you place a large order that will be heavy , i would leave special instructions to put extra tape on the inside box or not to use the red boxes .
neutral	contents falling out of the smaller box into the larger usps box could easily break through the cardboard with shifting weight .
neutral	mine were still in the usps box , but several containers had broken free of their internal box and were loose in the usps box .
neutral	it freaked me out when i opened it , because i thought that somebody had tampered with the package .
neutral	i appreciate their low shipping cost and low premiums on new silver_coins .
neutral	i would order with them again , but i would definitely leave special instructions for better packing and tell them that if they ' re going to use those red boxes to tape it up like a mummy .
neutral	the glasses are ok , not really what i wanted but it '_s hard to tell what they will look like till you get them .
neutral	the order took_longer to fulfill than advertised but i understand they had to make the lenses again due to a qc issue .
neutral	i would use them again but not for glasses i needed quickly as it took a month and a half for my glasses to arrive from the date of my order .
neutral	some parts of tour are very slow , information could be more detailed , its a bit hard to use as a transport method from site to site whem it costs so much for a ticket for just one day
neutral	i am not happy about shipping cost .
neutral	i got a steering damper in a box that could hold six or seven dampers .
neutral	and another box with four exhaust hangers that could hold at_least a dozen hangers .
neutral	i had to pay $ 0 . 00 each box .
neutral	there is no reason both parts were not shipped in one box .
neutral	had to wait one day .
neutral	when i received the items yesterday i was happy with the quality .
neutral	just how long it took to ship out was aggravating
neutral	as for your service it was great including the price .
neutral	the only problem i had was with fedex your shipper .
neutral	instead of my part being delivered to my home , it was delivered to the local post_office for them deliver which add an extra day to the 0 - 0 business days according to your site .
neutral	the ordering_process was quick and easy even for 0st - time customer .
neutral	but from that point there was a period of confusion .
neutral	i received a stream of e_-_mails from the store saying that i had left something in my basket , making me think that the order failed somewhere even_though i received a confirmation e_-_mail .
neutral	but a week_later the product arrived via_ups .
neutral	without the strange e_-_mails in the middle , this shop would have warranted at_least 0_stars .
neutral	the website was good .
neutral	and you had what i wanted .
neutral	the trouble began with your choice of delivery company .
neutral	royal_mail .
neutral	not for the first time i had a nightmare with them .
neutral	and in the end the product had to be returned to you .
neutral	so i got a refund .
neutral	the parts i received were ok , but i like to order from a person .
neutral	when you have technical questions you want to talk to someone .
neutral	it took me way to long to complete my order .
neutral	i was concerned_about ambientedirect .
neutral	i had several problems with an order i put back in july .
neutral	some of the problems where not their fault , others where a consequence of lack of information on the site .
neutral	now i have a credit against them , a lamp that they cannot deliver to me .
neutral	i was very concerned that i might not receive my money back .
neutral	specially considering that the company has so many bad_reviews on this site .
neutral	i put a complaint on this site and sent an_email to them yesterday .
neutral	in less_than 00_hours i got a reponse that was very satisfactory .
neutral	it seems that things are not as bad as people say , on the contrary .
neutral	as soon as they credit me back i will post the information here .
neutral	i have given a one_sentence remark of outstanding service but i heavily qualify that when i say that the withdrawal , without consultation , of the super atomiser shows poor marketing prowess .
neutral	it was a product i was superbly satisfied with and it was removed without notice .
neutral	not a company that really gives a damn about how customers really feel .
neutral	other than that the delivery and price are excellent
neutral	i had written to parts_geek seeking clarification before i purchased a set of struts for my car . i never got an answer to my question . they kept answering my question by sending me a link to a tail_light_assembly - totally unrelated !
neutral	i received what i ordered but in two different shipments , days apart . i had though part of my order was not shipped .
neutral	price was good but the support not there .
neutral	great prices , could have wanted an_email_saying that my items have been shipped .
neutral	but the main problem is that they only send on monday , wednesday and friday ..
neutral	arrive for flight at 0am and had to wait at_least 00_mins in sub zero temperatures to hand my car over .
neutral	the problem was not enough people and little organisation at drop_off point .
neutral	found my own forms in the end to try and speed up process .
neutral	they need to check flight schedules closer or only book what they can handle .
neutral	pick_up a little easier and no dragging cases onto buses .
neutral	having found the website i found it very informative and comprehensive .
neutral	sadly this has_been blighted by the wrong part arriving and no shower for another week !
neutral	after calling & being told to send an_email for 00 hr .
neutral	response service , " which i did receive ", the part i ordered was correct & did receive promptly .
neutral	good prices , great selection . but you can ` t talk to anyone .
neutral	i live in the dc metro area and like most folks in this area have a commute on both_sides of my workday that adds another 00_minutes to two hours to my workday .
neutral	consequently , any extensive or time_consuming repairs to my vehicles have to be planned carefully .
neutral	i typically shop a local outlet of a major_chain , often buying on - line and picking_up at the store .
neutral	the price for the parts i purchased at parts_geek including shipping was better_than my normal store so i thought i ' d give it a shot .
neutral	my order consisted of front_struts and rear_shocks .
neutral	i received one of the shocks the day before the day the parts were promised .
neutral	the next_day , friday , i received the two front_struts but no second rear_shock .
neutral	so i '_m looking at being unable to get my project completed as planned on saturday .
neutral	it was most frustrating not to be able to talk to an actual person .
neutral	their idea of convenient customer service is to have customers write them an_email to which they will respond within 00 - 00_hours .
neutral	from the distribution company i was able to get a number for the main_office .
neutral	no one answered .
neutral	i sent them emails to let them know of my dissatisfaction with not being_able to contact them .
neutral	i was eventually contacted by a customer service rep on the following_monday .
neutral	by then i had bought a shock from my local parts store and completed the project .
neutral	while they did refund the price of the shock , no offer was made to compensate me for the frustration i had experienced in dealing_with them .
neutral	on the bright side the refund was quickly processed and the materials i ordered were in excellent condition , fitted well , and were all they were advertised to be
neutral	i ordered a mercedes c class car , but received a volkswagon suv .
neutral	that is technicaly the same class car , but not able to travel the autobahn in the same way .
neutral	dissappointed .
neutral	falls bei e bookers etwas nicht dem standrisierten vorgehen entspricht wird es echt kompliziert und_ist_nicht kundenfreundlich .
neutral	beispiel habe für 0 personen einen flug von zh nach sofia gebucht .
neutral	da wir mit_einer gruppe von 00 personen nach bulgarien reisen , wollte ich vom ebookers angebot ein hotel in sofia zu buchen gebrauch machen .
neutral	doch ich_konnte das hotel für 00 personen nicht buchen .
neutral	telefonierte daraufhin auf_die " hotline ".
neutral	nach rund 0 minuten wurde der anruf angenommen .
neutral	ich erklärte der telefonistin mein problem .
neutral	sie konnte mir nicht helfen und bat mich zu warten , damit sie sich bei_einer kollegin erkundigen könne .
neutral	nach rund 0 minütigem warten , hängte man mir auf .
neutral	das_ist kein service und_ich_werde bei ebookers hotels nur noch im äussersten notfall buchen
neutral	i bought a headlight panel plus other lights . the panel didn_'_t have all the holes drilled that were supposed to . could have used some screws cause some were missing . but i made it work . could have used a headlight clip cause mine was worn out . ill more then likely buy from there again . but maybe not body parts
neutral	i live in wi and ordered the fitnesspro super whey ( 0lb ) chocolate through the website .
neutral	the price was / is great however the shipping really minimizes that .
neutral	living less_than 00_minutes from their warehouse and having to pay $_00 + for shipping seems extreme , okay it is extreme .
neutral	i will have to look at their retail_store but ( based on the website information ) assume the prices will be higher which doesn_'_t make much sense considering how close they are to eachother .
neutral	for may people who do not live in wi this is not even an option however .
neutral	the purchasing process was quick and easy and shipping was quick ( good thing again for the price of it !).
neutral	i wish supplement_warehouse had options for cheaper shipping , however other than that i will at_least look at them again before buying supplements other_places .
neutral	as far as the product itself , it was exactly as_described .
neutral	it does what it says !
neutral	my samsung_galaxy note 0 from globe telecom was unlocked easily .
neutral	the price i paid is $_00 . 00 and they promised a 00_% refund if i upload the video of unlocking .
neutral	i did .
neutral	but after about 0_weeks , i still have not received any word from them whether the video i made and uploaded is approved .
neutral	i made several followup already but no reply from them .
neutral	while the code worked .
neutral	i think it is very expensive at $_00 . 00
neutral	at first , they have the best prices and quickest service !
neutral	but i booked the wrong date , and had to change it .
neutral	i could not reach a human voice to help me .
neutral	their website wouldn_'_t forward my emails .
neutral	and the hotel didn_'_t email me my hotel packet !
neutral	i '_ve been waiting for a response for 0 hours !
neutral	nothing !
neutral	i thought boiler_juice always sourced oil at the most competive price , and that bulk orders to a particular postal code carried some element of a discount .
neutral	i am better informed now and will check with a price comparison website before using boiler_juice next time .
neutral	well , all went well until i opened box .
neutral	it shipped when they said it would .
neutral	great communication via_email .
neutral	all the silver was correct but the gold_coins were another matter .
neutral	i ordered canadian 0 oz maple - leafs .
neutral	received american buffalos .
neutral	i guess it work slightly to my advantage in that most resellers sell this coin for slightly_higher but i collect maple - leafs .
neutral	great site great value and after the initial delivery fiasco which was down dpd not musclefinesse the customer service was prompt and efficient .
neutral	goods turned_up nxt_day and were as_advertised .
neutral	only issue i still have is that quoted on delivery note were free_samples and none were packed / arrived ..??
neutral	?
neutral	slightly dissatisfied
neutral	online checkout kept bring the same screen back up after i made a selection ... as if i didn_'_t have cookies or popups enabled ... finally worked the 0th time .
neutral	important that it only took my credit_card info one time , so not a major problem .
neutral	the tour was excellent but it seemed to go around hyde_park corner several_times .
neutral	eventually we got stuck in a hugetraffic jam near piccadlly circus - got off which was the best option .
neutral	later took the river_cruise - wonderful and the commentator was very amusing .
neutral	if you take the bus_tour go as early as possible .
neutral	this site is the bomb !
neutral	but quite often i find the things i want to buy are out of stock .
neutral	returning a purchase is not as easy with luna bazaar as it is with most companies i shop with .
neutral	one of the parasols i ordered was ripped .
neutral	so i taped it .
neutral	not sure if i will order again from luna bazaar .
neutral	i love the parasols but if i find another company that has easier returns then i will not use luna bazaar again .
neutral	having to pay for a return when it has to be returned due to a fault of theirs is not fair .
neutral	i need them because i can not be in the sun due to a medication i am on for the rest of my life so i am sure i will be getting many many more .
neutral	i just wish the one had not been torn already when i got it or at_least free shipping if returning due to manufacturer defect .
neutral	fast service .
neutral	great place to buy from if you only need some of what you order .
neutral	i ordered a book from them .
neutral	i received it in a very timely_manner and was pleased with the service .
neutral	they did what they said they would do and got me into a payment arrangement with the irs , but my payments are higher_than what i expected .
neutral	they did prevent the irs from taking my retirement account , which is a big relief .
neutral	i am still_awaiting delivery ... the delivery company did not attend my home address at the allotted_time and then claimed i was not in when i took the afternoon of work ... not impressed and i am awaiting delivery on 00th ... watch this space ...
neutral	the product selection and pricing is good .
neutral	i ordered 0 products which were came up as separate charges on my credit_card - probably because they were shipped as two packages .
neutral	both charges on the credit_card were incorrect by a small but significant_amount .
neutral	fortunately i noticed this in a timely_fashion .
neutral	the customer service representative was pleasant , and although he provided several incorrect explanations for the discrepancies , he did issue me a credit .
neutral	he did not offer any explanation for the mischarges .
neutral	to tight in our machine .
neutral	please revise
neutral	cost of postage and packing was over the top .
neutral	shame to be so greedy
neutral	nice website and good deal .
neutral	reason used it because bill me later .
neutral	after purchasing package it told me that i have to pay taxes at hotel .
neutral	this was not cleared when purchasing package and was part of fine_print .
neutral	next time i will use expedia
neutral	the one_sentence tells it all
neutral	slow delivery and expensive postage let the overall experience down .
neutral	products are good , but others are catching up and offering better service which would make me spend my money elsewhere .
neutral	i like the frequqnt promotions but the user_interface is not the smoothest .
neutral	this is true for both the website and the app .
neutral	in general the layout looks bland and cluttered .
neutral	it '_s not the cleanest and most pleasant_experience to use it .
neutral	competitors such as seamless have a much more robust and cleanly designed app .
neutral	i do like the reward_system which is the sole reason i continue to use your service .
neutral	that and the promotions .
neutral	i got really screwed over as i was using a prepaid_visa on paypal i tried the second day to buy another iyem and my order got cancelled and i lost my money on that visa_card for like 00 days so it made , me mad but i did get my first code no_problems
neutral	quality product , reliable company .
neutral	just a little_pricey .
neutral	when i was unable to cancel my reservation i called the number i found on your site .
neutral	the person_who answered the phone told me that i should call back in 0 hours , no explaination .
neutral	i have a problem with picture '_s of items with discreptions that don_'_t have enough info . the igniton wires for a 00 cadillac were not close to the picture that showed a 00_% boot that was needed for # 0 plug and on the old set .
neutral	i know it is a older car and much is a general fit and all pics don_'_t match the product that got shipped .
neutral	i worked through it .
neutral	... but
neutral	the dist cap i recieved is the wrong color .
neutral	i know you are scatching your head right now but this is for a very correct looking car .
neutral	both caps on your site showed them black , the one i recived is bright blue ( standards signature ) need to send that back .
neutral	was very impreased with the amount of available parts for that applacation
neutral	yesstyle has an amazing selection of trendy and not - so - normal items .
neutral	there '_s bound to be something for you at a reasonable price ( until you tack on that mandatory express shipping ).
neutral	and when you find that wonderful piece of clothing to complete your look you place that order in joy , only to be e_- mailed a week_later telling you that your item is no_longer in stock and a half - hearted robot automated sorry for the inconvenience message !
neutral	happened to me 0 times just trying to order a coat for winter ... by the time i was actually able to buy and receive a coat winter was already over .
neutral	now i have an expensive clothing hanger decoration .
neutral	yesstyle would genuinely by a 0 - star establishment if they updated their stock frequently so i '_m not wasting my time buying items that don_'_t exist .
neutral	easy to use and good product and good service .
neutral	should have some proof reading to support customers mistakes .
neutral	while you are covered since the customer signs off on the design .
neutral	customers make mistakes also .
neutral	prices are high and i will_continue to look for alternatives .
neutral	i would not look if the prices were better .
neutral	thank_you very much
neutral	although it appeared that great care was used to wrap the part it still arrived broken as no packing_material was placed on the end that was fragile .
neutral	the car had already been down for a wek i needed to get it running so installed the part instead of returning it .
neutral	my sunglasses arrived_promptly , earlier_than i expected .
neutral	however the lens cleaing kit did not arrive with the original order as_advertised .
neutral	it took 0 additional emails and a wait of three_weeks for the kit to be sent
neutral	pretty fast 00_% of the time .
neutral	only had two bad_experiences of the 00 or so times when i transacted with pcgamesupply .
neutral	first time when changed my credit_card and the order was not approved in the 00_minutes as the website promised even_tho i was a repeat_customer .. dunno what the deal with that was and the second time the itunes code they provided me did not work .. but they sent me another one that did .
neutral	if it wasn_'_t for these 0 experiences i would have given them a 0_star_rating .
neutral	other than that i haven_'_t had any_issues , this is a great way of getting itunes_gift_cards from the us when i '_m in australia so i can buy rent movies from the us store .
neutral	the villa gris has a good location and ourselves , family and grandchildern enjoyed our holiday .
neutral	the nearby town of cuitadella was amazing and everything you enjoy about spain from the fantastic fish restaurants to the boats and shops .
neutral	the few things that were disapponiting was the constent odour from the downstairs bathroom , the rep informed us that all menorca properties suffer from this ?, the other issue being the pool heating , which made a big_difference when it was working , had a problem .
neutral	the service from the rep was poor , i phoned several_times to report either the pool heating was not working or we had no hot_water and on each ocassion there was no follow_up , it required me to contact her .
neutral	this was our first time using villa_plus and the experience fell short of our expectations as we rent a villa each year in europe and have fantasic holidays .
neutral	walmart has sort of a bad reputation , although most of it is not true .
neutral	their prices are low and they probably have some questionable business_practices as with most giant corporations .
neutral	the customer service is terrible and you should not expect much from the employees as they are probably already understaffed so they are all overworked .
neutral	i used to work for walmart and this is how it was pretty_much every night .
neutral	but , their products are not low quality , and the overall experience isn_'_t bad .
neutral	occasionally i have gotten false alerts or alerts that don_'_t need immediate_attention .
neutral	however they say to contact them " immediately " .
neutral	big pain if you think your identity is in danger so you drop what you are doing and it turns_out to be nothing .
neutral	otherwise i guess they do what they say
neutral	it took over a week and a half for the product to arrive .
neutral	i noticed when following the parcel on the postage company '_s website that the product actually came from hong_kong .
neutral	i was under the impression i was buying australian .
neutral	the product came and at face value it seems legitimate , but on close comparison with an authentic product there are subtle differences which make me question the authenticity of the product i purchased .
neutral	most of the parts i ordered were fine , but some had no accessories like the nuts for one of my stabilizer links and one of my ball_joints had a threaded stud and a unthreaded stud . the list shows that the brake_pad for a 0000 camry le 0 . 0 and a xle 0 . 0 have the same pad , which is not correct , i have a 0000 xle 0 . 0 and the pads and rotor are bigger than the 0 . 0 . i need to return brake_pads , rotor , and control_arm .
neutral	we were a little_worried_about booking with an intermediary and were somewhat perplexed that a secure booking icon did not appear when giving our credit_card details but we took a chance - having searched for company reviews on other_websites , and it all worked out in the end .
neutral	a little more stressful than normal , as a result - for booking flights , hence three stars , as you have have other things to consider like inadvertently buying insurance , booking the correct flights on the wrong day etc etc .
neutral	ami club wear has a great selection in clothes and shoes with really good deals but what they lack in customer service they never sent me a email_saying when they were shipping my order i currently have a back order and have no_idea when its coming
neutral	your low_prices are really good , but ur customer_services , not so good !!
neutral	in the 0 times that i '_ve ordered , 0 times out of the 0 the order delivered to me was wrong !!
neutral	0st time the order was corrected , second time , i phoned up 0 times in one week , and there seamed no interest in correcting my order so i gave up !
neutral	!
neutral	it was suppose to be a 0 - 0 delivery time but it took ten days , i was ordering from spain .
neutral	the price was good though and the international delivery free .
neutral	i ordered a honda_accord tail_light which arrived on time .
neutral	the part was a perfect match when compared to the original .
neutral	my only_complaint , the light was shipped in it '_s original box with no additional packing_material added to the inside .
neutral	a small corner of the light was damaged in shipment .
neutral	the light is still useable .
neutral	i would suggest adding additional packing_material inside or double boxing .
neutral	had the understanding that if i called a representative i could get a 0 %_discount , not a big discount but a good amount on a big trip , was offered $_00 discount .
neutral	that is 0 / 0 %_discount and probably spent more in minutes trying to get the 0 %_discount .
neutral	gee fred , partsgeeks said they had my fog_lights for my jag .... but when i tried to order two of them ... they said they only had one , so i ordered it .
neutral	the next_day they said they still had one etc , etc .
neutral	was this some kind of gimmick ?
neutral	then i received some invasive b / s on free shipping ... well yeah i '_m game !
neutral	until they wanted too much info !!!
neutral	i backed out ... may look_elsewhere for my other fog_light .
neutral	great parts at a great price but be cautious with the shipping .
neutral	booked tryes for a thursday fitting , and was then told they would not in fact be available until the friday .
neutral	also no electronic receipt supplied to prove that / when tryes were changed ( needed for service record ).
neutral	very good item , but one shirt came without being wrap for shipment .
neutral	received package in good condition amazingly , since it was shipped across the pond in a soft container .
neutral	put the pipe together by the book and tried to draw .
neutral	very hard draw and no vapor .
neutral	light comes on and the mechanism gets warm but no vapor .
neutral	highly disappointed .
neutral	edit - got an e_-_mail soon after posting this review from tara that solved the problem .
neutral	an invisible clear plastic " protective " covering on the intake air hole that is not mentioned in the manual .
neutral	brought a possible 0_star_rating down to 0_star for embarrassing me so badly .
neutral	:)
neutral	so , after all that !
neutral	the e_- pipe is very high_quality workmanship wise and looks very nice .
neutral	i think i will be very satisfied with the e_- pipe once i get over my embarrassment !
neutral	problems with the website and then with paypal .
neutral	sent an_email to cancel the order and never_heard from a soul !!
neutral	!
neutral	instead , lo and behold , the item showed_up on my doorstep .
neutral	tried_calling them too ; wasn_'_t shocked when i didn_'_t receive an answer !
neutral	if cost is all that matters , tread lightly .
neutral	ks
neutral	mattressman fine to deal with have purchased from them before .
neutral	delivery firm mh logistics not great .
neutral	delivered the day before arranged date .
neutral	the card they left said they would deliver next working day .
neutral	we phoned them to try and get a rough time more chance of winning lottery .
neutral	said they didnt know if would be delivered next_day ( the day they should have delivered in first place as we had arranged to be in that day ) told them in no uncertain terms that it better be delivered that as it says on card .
neutral	rubbish couriers
neutral	tyres were here when they said .
neutral	however had to wait over an_hour and it wasn_'_t that busy , only two fitters on duty .
neutral	said they would phone when car was ready still_waiting on call !!
neutral	went back an_hour later and car was ready but didn_'_t bother to phone .
neutral	i wonder_if because you haven_'_t actually bought the tyres from national that you are at the bottom of the fitting list ?
neutral	part delivered on time ; however , had a broken section .
neutral	didn_'_t report the issue because i needed the part , so i can '_t give any opinion on the customer service .
neutral	love partsgeek prices and parts quality .
neutral	only draw_back is the time involved in receiving parts .
neutral	ordered on tuesday_morning , thinking i would have everything to do a brake job on my wifes_car .
neutral	rotors came on friday , but pads didn_'_t come until the following_tuesday .
neutral	love you guys , but can '_t wait that long next time and the overnight or next_day puts the value for partsgeek at a level playing field with box stores .
neutral	dart kwik - fit used to be a respectable garage to take your car , but in the last couple of years they have employed some childish staff there making the experience rubbish
neutral	i am looking for delivery ... ㅜㅜ
neutral	ordered four tubs of fat - balls at a great price with free delivery .
neutral	did not receive promised email to state when delivery would be made , when the items turned_up two_days_later ( very quick ) two of the containers were badly_damaged but as none of the contents appeared to be missing i accepted the shipment .
neutral	did not get help untill reporting here .
neutral	after reporting here the problem was solved fast .
neutral	i believe the company is consious about its reputation , but its business processes do not work properly yet .
neutral	i didn_'_t get the right part & i had to pay return potage but had no return hassle except waiting a few_days to get it authorized
neutral	i don_'_t know why i continue to pay for your services .
neutral	i upgraded so i could get monthly credit_reports and the only_thing you '_ve ever told me about my credit is that its unrated ???
neutral	how did i get from poor credit to no credit ?
neutral	the car was very good and the enrollment process was acceptable .
neutral	however , in g . b .
neutral	and ireland , most credit_cards will not cover the insurance requirements and this means a very large daily rate to actually be able to rent the car .
neutral	beware !!
neutral	!
neutral	i got the ink_cartridges and have had problems getting documents to print because it says ink is empty .
neutral	the disclaimers were good because all the cartridges showed the were empty .
neutral	i could not print at all w one black_cartridge , i changed it out and it finally printed
neutral	firstly , the price is very good , as is the array of options available , so full_marks there .
neutral	secondly , some of the staff were very helpful and eager to please .
neutral	mostly .
neutral	the first niggle , however , centred around payment .
neutral	i live in a flat , and therefore seem to have a number of ways to write my address .
neutral	when trying to pay , i was told by bathempire that each time i gave my address , the authorisation was rejected by my credit_card company on the grounds that my address didn_'_t match their records .
neutral	when i called my credit_card company , they checked their records and said that there was no problem , and that they had indeed authorised payment .
neutral	back to bathempire , they said : no , the transaction hadn_'_t been authorised by the credit_card company , and they had tried several_times .
neutral	back to the credit_card company , and * they * said that they had approved multiple transaction requests by bathempire ..
neutral	the money hadn_'_t actually come off my credit_card , but the authorisation credit * had * been , meaning that i basically couldn_'_t use my credit_card for a week until the authorisation for the four - figure sum had expired .
neutral	i still don_'_t know why bathempire couldn_'_t take the money , but i basically had to ask a friend to help out and pay for me , then pay them back later .
neutral	quite frustrating , and i still don_'_t know why there was a problem , when clearly the credit_card company said the problem lay with bath_empire .
neutral	the second and more major problem for me started off with a problem with one of the components - a simple plug .
neutral	i had ordered a plug based on the advice of the sales_assistant .
neutral	when it arrived , it turned_out it was the wrong one .
neutral	" no big_deal ", i thought , " they seemed decent on the phone , they '_ll soon sort this out , i '_m sure ".
neutral	i called bathempire and explained , and i expected something along the lines of " no problem sir , please accept our apologies for sending the wrong component .
neutral	we '_ll get the correct one sent to you right_away .
neutral	send the other one back when you can ".
neutral	but ... what i got was a pretty miserable " you '_ll have to buy another one .
neutral	we will refund you your money for the old one when you send it back ".
neutral	i was pretty miffed , and they didn_'_t seem to care when i underlined that the mistake was theirs , and that i had been a pretty good customer of theirs , considering the amount of money i had spent .
neutral	but it fell on deaf_ears , and they just spoke over me .
neutral	it got even more frustrating .
neutral	since i work every day , and in the middle of the countryside , it '_s incredibly difficult for me to get to a post_office to post the old one back .
neutral	as luck would have it , i only live around 00miles away from bathempire , so i offered to help save everyone '_s time , money and effort by simply returning the " wrong " component to them in person one evening ( their sales office is open until 0pm or something ).
neutral	this way , they needn_'_t post it , they needn_'_t wait for the wrong one , and i ' d get my correct plug .
neutral	simple and quick , i thought !
neutral	but no !
neutral	it payed out something like this , when i offered to bring the wrong plug back and buy the correct one :
neutral	- " what time do you want to come sir ?
neutral	".
neutral	- " about 0 .
neutral	or whenever really , i '_m flexible after 0 ."
neutral	- " let_me check with my supervisor "
neutral	...
neutral	...
neutral	" we can '_t do that sir .
neutral	the warehouse shuts at 0pm ."
neutral	" but surely you can book out a simple plug and leave it with someone , can '_t you ?"
neutral	" no ".
neutral	i think i hung_up in frustration after that - pretty seething at how inflexible they had been .
neutral	but .. a day or two later , i called up and asked to speak to the rather helpful and likeable sales_assistant who had processed my original order .
neutral	i explained what had happened .
neutral	to my pleasant surprised , i got something akin to the following :
neutral	" i '_m so sorry_sir , that was our mistake .
neutral	please accept our apologies .
neutral	we will send you the correct plug right_away .
neutral	no charge .
neutral	you needn_'_t send back the old one .
neutral	it was out fault ."
neutral	quite amazing .
neutral	i think there '_s a mixture of star_ratings in there , starting with 0 , then down to three , then one , then five .
neutral	i ' d say 0 out of 0 is fair , given what i experienced .
neutral	but i ' d definitely use them again .
neutral	just make_sure you ask to speak to vicky .
neutral	i buy one product in bulk , perpsi rock which is a good product but it needs some attention in terms of product delivery system to make it more appealing .
neutral	.
neutral	the reception i recieved at the garage was not what i expect from a supplier .
neutral	a little courtesy to a customer would have been appropiate .
neutral	the lady booking the package kept confusing our information after multiple_attempts of repeating our information .
neutral	she said she was feeling under the weather so we stayed on the line even_though my boyfriend was ready to be transferred to a supervisor .
neutral	called to confirm my reservation and was told the computers were frozen and it would take a few min .
neutral	to clear up .
neutral	well .......... after holding for 00 min .
neutral	i told them i would call back and check later in the day .
neutral	called back 0 hours_later only to hear the same story !!!..
neutral	i understand things_happen but if you are a service that depends on the customer to survive , it should be the most_important_thing on your " to do list " to make_sure your computers are working in order to provide the information requested by the caller .
neutral	might want to look into a upgrade !!!
neutral	( note_: called the hotel myself and found out my reservation was confirmed )
neutral	i ordered two mirrors the left mirror was not the same color as the right one , so i contacted them .
neutral	it took two_weeks to finally get it resolved to where i was to send it back and get another one .
neutral	well i received the second mirror and it still was not the same and i sent all the mirrors back and it cost me roughly_$_00 in shopping after it was all said and done .
neutral	what a joke .
neutral	shopping_experience was simple and fast .
neutral	however , the delivery was a total let_down : parcelforce failed to leave a note so i wasted time , energy on them and only picked_up my parcel from the post_office several days_later .
neutral	i had to do all the leg work , which does not equate to good service .
neutral	ehhh ill think_twice before ordering again
neutral	i ordered two different parts .
neutral	different part names turns_out to be the same part !
neutral	bit disappointing .
neutral	overall service was fine , relatively easy to order online and delivery came well within the 00 day delivery period , unlike last time which was dead on the 00 day limit .
neutral	i don_'_t like debiting of the money before delivery is made , i think it should be on or just afterwards .
neutral	also i did not appreciate being woken up around 0 : 00 to allow access .
neutral	why do the deliveries have to start so early ?
neutral	what '_s wrong with an 0 : 00 or later start ?
neutral	re , customer_services comments
neutral	0 ) other_companies manage to arrange payment on or after delivery .
neutral	0 ) delivery driver stated that they always start early and not just during a busy period .
neutral	even if this was just to couple with demand , what '_s wrong with working late rather_than starting early ?
neutral	one month_ago i ordered from gillygifts ltd . order ref last 0 digits 0000 .
neutral	money was taken off immediately on ordering the item online but it still has not arrived .
neutral	my e_-_mails and phone_calls have been ignored by this company .
neutral	on phoning them i have got an answer phone which is very poor for customer - client relations and for a caring company !
neutral	refund given .
neutral	business manager stated that he sent item which should have arrived 00 days after order and subsequently was on holiday .
neutral	the gift was not received and refund agreed .
neutral	matter resolved immediately after posting review .
neutral	thanks .
neutral	bought my lg d0000tf dishwasher from appliances_online , excelent price and short delivery .
neutral	used my new diswasher for the first time and found water and steam leeking from the botton left_hand side of the door .
neutral	got in touch with lg last_week but still nothing done , also checked on the internet and found others with the same problem .
neutral	i think that this product should not be sold until this problem is resolved .
neutral	i had no_issues ordering a couple of parking lights for my truck but it was funny that i never got any emails from partsgeek , no invoice , no shipping info , nothing .
neutral	i even tried to submit a ticket to verify that the order had gone_through , and again no response .
neutral	a bit odd i do believe .
neutral	i even checked to see if my email was somehow deleting them and it was not .
neutral	but i am happy with the parts , they fit_perfectly .
neutral	i liked this vendor '_s price and thats_why i purchased the part , however they took long to process and delivery was to be by fedex so i expected a day or two - not the case , it was sent the slowest possible fedex and the company did not follow_up - so next time i might pay more just to get delivery in just a day or two .
neutral	great prices , they just don_'_t ansewer their phones or return calls in a reasonable time .
neutral	great prices though .
neutral	my delivery arrived quickly and efficiently , however one of my orders was completely the wrong_size .
neutral	i had ordered tracksuit bottoms in large mens and they came in small mens with a 00 inch waist .
neutral	i returned the goods nearly a week_ago and have had no correspondence from barrington_sports about my order and return .
neutral	i was never emailed an order confirmation .
neutral	when i went to check on shipping status , i could not sign in without order number .
neutral	i received no response to inquiry ticket i opened and after finding phone_number on my credit_card statement there was never an answer and finally no response to phone message that i left .
neutral	part did arrive quickly but i would have liked to be able to track it so i could plan when i would work on the car .
neutral	dear identity_guard company ,
neutral	i have been a loyal_customer of yours for a few_years_now and first would like to say thank_you for providing a great service to your customers .
neutral	as a loyal_customer , i have recommended my friends and family to try your service .
neutral	the reason i am writing you today is because i have observed some concerns about your company that i would like to bring to your attention .
neutral	the first is that , while there happen to be several apple users , identity_guard does not offer any software to my knowledge that is compatible with apple computers .
neutral	secondly , i have just discovered that apparently identity_guard does not offer fraud alerts to credit_bureaus .
neutral	while i have researched the software you provide for windows users on their computers , i have learned the software is not as secure or useful as some other software programs on the market .
neutral	for example , you provide zonealarm for your customers but it does not do as well as kaspersky or bitdefender .
neutral	secondly , while you offer id vault , i have discovered that lastpass and dashlane are both rated better with not only better security , but more features .
neutral	lastly , the privacyprotect software you offer is probably one of the worst i have ever_seen .
neutral	an excellent replacement that i highly_recommend is spyshelter .
neutral	i am writing you this email because as a customer , i appreciate your dedication and effort to protecting my identity and my privacy .
neutral	i ask that you please pass this email to both your supervisor and manager for consideration of my advice and suggestions .
neutral	while i understand no company is perfect , as a business who protects the identity and privacy of it '_s customers and has big rivals such as lifelock and identityforce , i encourage it would be wise to upgrade to better software .
neutral	local_supplier , with the stock i need and keen prices .
neutral	free local delivery did not work , so had to collect .
neutral	the first bit if confusion was finding the flippin ' office to get our tickets .
neutral	i booked this online from our hotel , and the address and company name on the website was not the address and company name we finally found !
neutral	only by walking in to a couple of businesses and asking did we finally find either the correct business , or one who accepted our online reservation forms .
neutral	after that point the organization was a little_bit better .
neutral	we took a 0 hour tour which included windmills , cheese factory , wooden shoe factory , and a short boat_ride .
neutral	the length and stops for the tour were good .
neutral	i did not like the tour director funneling us towards one restaurant where she obviously received a spiff or other monetary compensation for pushing in tourists .
neutral	our final assessment was it was better_than not going , but i '_m not sure i could talk my husband into a second similar trip .
neutral	everything is great the controller works_fine and the led_lights are badass but the buttons are the wrong color , i had asked for chrome gold and i got yellow but other than that its great otherwise .
neutral	your site would not accept my pw to place the order ... this is even after i changed my pw ( so i knew it was the correct pw ) ... had to place the order as a guest
neutral	i '_ve flown with flybe a few_times recently and i '_ve always found their flights to be good value for the price .
neutral	my gripe is i '_ve had to try to rearrange flights with flybe on a couple of occasions , and it actually works out to be more_expensive to rearrange than to cancel and book again .
neutral	no_longer will flybe be my first choice airline from my local airport as they were before .
neutral	would recommend the products as are a good price , tastes pretty good and seems to have the desired effect , but was pretty pi00ed off when i got charged a fiver for delivery because i live in the highlands of scotland - on front page of the site , big box stating free delivery to mainland_uk .
neutral	check your maps , myprotein - inverness is on the mainland !
neutral	!
neutral	if you live outwith the highlands , recommended though .
neutral	i was looking_forward to breaking in my brasher hillmaster gtx boots the weekend after successfully , or so i thought , placing the order with cheaptents .
neutral	i was disappointed to hear that they weren_'_t available after going through the purchasing process and subsequent concern that my card would be debited didn_'_t help matters .
neutral	fair play , a range of alternative boots were offered .
neutral	in the end , made my brasher purchase elsewhere .
neutral	i ordered from the usa , thinking they were a us store .
neutral	i received the glasses but then a $_00 bill for customs_duty .
neutral	so they were not the cheapest online option .
neutral	glasses were ok .
neutral	good points .
neutral	easy to build , looks great , feels safe .
neutral	bad .
neutral	instruction very poor , our enclosure was the one we wanted but the instructions in the box were for a different enclosure which mis lead us to build with the connection " t " s installed the wrong way round , this only becomes clear when you try and fit the spring cover , so had to dismantle back to the beginning and rebuild .
neutral	good ... raise query on line ( it was 0pm ) got reply in the morning , very polite man was helpful but confirmed our fears .
neutral	made him aware of our experience .
neutral	they do not allow you to cancel or change your order once it is placed , even before it begins processing .
neutral	there is no regret period .
neutral	the order cannot be intercepted and changed nor cancelled .
neutral	so , be very very careful before you confirm your order you may end up having to return it with a ran .
neutral	yup , i made a mistake and ordered the wrong part , but fortunately , i was able to cannibalize the part i ordered , so in the end , even_though i made a mistake in my order , it worked out ok .
neutral	but i got lucky .
neutral	time to go buy a lottery ticket .
neutral	good prices but terrible shipping .
neutral	more options like express delivery should be available .
neutral	bad_boy has great products but placing international orders isn_'_t always the most convenient nor the most pleasant .
neutral	will use in the future , but caution that parts do not always arrive when i need them .
neutral	the return process words , but was lengthy when i returned part in sept .
neutral	checked 0 days ago and part was still in texas .
neutral	the ordering was simple and the price was very good as for the flowers themselves i cannot_comment on .
neutral	so 0_stars for the internet ease .
neutral	great service .
neutral	it '_s good to get an update but getting 0 emails from shima , seems a bit over the top .
neutral	just need two , one to say it '_s ordered and another to say when it is going to be delivered .
neutral	thanks
neutral	mike
neutral	price given was very good . but look out for hidden_extras !
neutral	charge for fuel was a bit_steep . hire company in malaga not very efficient it took about one & a half hours to get the car . dont need these delays when you have on the road for hours .
neutral	while petflow '_s pricing is comparable to petfood direct and a few other on - line websites , their free shipping offer made the difference to me to give them a try .
neutral	but when the order arrived , although the packaging looked substantial enough , three cans of wellness catfood were crushed and unable to be opened without a hacksaw .
neutral	so , the free shipping savings quickly evaporates .
neutral	excellent received next_day but ps0 box was open and extra controller loose in outer_box
neutral	i had a part come to me damaged so i emailed them and about 0 days_later they said they would replace it if i wanted or refund my money .
neutral	they also stated they did not have the system in place to do a " swap " but they said to contact them if i wanted to swap it out so they could re - order the same part .
neutral	so i emailed them last_week saying i wanted to get a new part and i have yet to hear back from them .
neutral	but not like they care .
neutral	online sales_person was helpful .
neutral	computer despatched quicker_than sales_persons estimate .
neutral	so_far so good .
neutral	but delivery did not arrive on day promised and was damaged when it did arrive .
neutral	three_days waiting at home for deliveries and re - collections requiring lots of appointment changes .
neutral	promise of collection of damaged computer " by 0pm " not communicated to driver - more waiting and phone_calls .
neutral	very unsatisfactory .
neutral	everybody blames everybody_else for the damage .
neutral	however , staff at ginger0 turned round damaged machine quickly and now waiting for repaired machine ....
neutral	i wanted a harrington_jacket chest 00 " and i could not locate one anywhere .
neutral	finally baracuta said they had natural ones remaining - not my first choice of colour but it was take it or leave it as they were not having anymore in stock .
neutral	does that mean that the famous g0 is being discontinued ?
neutral	part arrived quickly and seems to work well .
neutral	there was basically no packing inside the box though , so it had a rough ride in shipping .
neutral	dont use hermes they break everything ,,,,,,,,,
neutral	advertised price was good , but when i came to book it , they cheekily added approx another 0 % charge as a booking_fee .
neutral	despite telling the staff who picked_up my car that my passenger door_handle is broken and do not use it , it was still half hanging off the car when it arrived .
neutral	oh and to get out of the car_park you need to park near the barriers , go inside a payment office and then go to the barriers .
neutral	i dont_know about you but i '_ve usually got foreign_currency on me when i return back to sunny blighty .
neutral	i did not see any information pointing to this and with other_companies we have used usually have a pre_- paid card to allow you to get on with your forward journey .
neutral	i ' d rather pay more (£ 0 wont break the bank ), get in the car and drive out and home .
neutral	that said , the guys were friendly and very prompt and it still represents good value for money .
neutral	the headlight was not secured well in the box and a plastic tab broke off .
neutral	hopefully the next one will arrive . in one piece .
neutral	ordered pair of superdry white shoes , when they arrived they were very badly marked , i needed them for going on holiday so didn_'_t have time to send them back .
neutral	i was very disappointed as i am a good customer !
neutral	i won_'_t order online again as i want to see the item first before i purchase it !
neutral	booked a hotel after a quick web search .
neutral	this showed easytobook as having the " cheapest " room rate .
neutral	however , it wasn_'_t until after i had paid that the full cost was shown - this being another £_00 on top of the headline rate for " taxes and booking fees ".
neutral	i would have complained and asked for my money back , but i didn_'_t want the hassle , and the total was the same as the room rate as_advertised on the hotel website .
neutral	still , not impressed .
neutral	total_cost should be shown prior to payment being made .
neutral	renting the car was easy and a reasonable rate , but all of the extra_charges become very expensive .
neutral	because it is out of country your own insurance will not cover you ( as it does in the us ) so extra insurance ( cdw ) is recommended , very expensive and the quoted rates are in pounds so watch the exchange_rate .
neutral	also the cars are smaller than in the us so if you are a big guy ( like me ) then you will need an upgrade unless you enjoy close company with your passengers .
neutral	.. products are good ,, prices are great but your delivery agent usps sucks .. in my neighborhood usps doesn_'_t seem to care if they get your package , they '_ll leave a note in mailbox to go pick it up next_day ,, too_lazy to get off the truck if it doesn_'_t fit in the mailbox .. so in the future if i buy something from you i want to know who is delivering so i can cancel it .
neutral	ps_: it would be nice to see illustration of the section of the related parts i order .. i mean if i need suspension parts , show a drawing of my car '_s suspension so that i order the correct part .
neutral	at times i don_'_t know the name of the part , but if i see it i know it '_s correct part by looking at it .. many of your single part pictures not always what i need .
neutral	i am trying to locate a reliable one source for quality automotive replacement parts , but still have to rely_on several sources for adequate pricing and availability ... you ' re not there yet !
neutral	i received the item promptly , however , the item description was a " streamlight " sl00x battery , leading me to believe i was indeed receiving a streamlight brand battery .
neutral	unfortunately what i received was a generic battery that was labeled " made in china " and although it fit my light , it was not exactly_what i wanted .
neutral	it will be interesting to see how long this imported clone actually lasts .
neutral	i should have known that the price was too good to be true .
neutral	the moral of the story : if you need a cheap battery and you don_'_t care where it was made , then this is the place to get it .
neutral	if you want usa made quality : order it somewhere_else .
neutral	a piece of advice to this company : note the actual brand and country of origin under the product description .
neutral	there are certainly many people who will buy it anyway and those of us who wouldn_'_t will go elsewhere and not be unhappy customers .
neutral	no direct phone line to " parts_geek " makes me nervous !
neutral	my order is incomplete ...
neutral	i thought that my parts would be sent in one shipment .
neutral	it appears that my parts were sipped in two_separate_shipments .
neutral	their customer service dept .
neutral	is in touch with me via_e_-_mail , to assist me in completing my experience .
neutral	i '_m hoping that my order will be completed and i will receive all of my other parts within a timely_manner .
neutral	i found the service good but the fee '_s are a bit high
neutral	i '_m really not sure why royalshave would send out an_email_asking me to review my experience with them before i have ever received the products that i ordered from them .
neutral	maybe if they asked me to review the service i have received , after the transaction has fully been completed i could give a much_better review .
neutral	i '_m not sure how to review them before i have actually received and used their product .
neutral	order processed efficiently , but the next_day delivery eventually took 00 days .
neutral	problem due to incorrect ( heavy ) item being sent , plus needed too many frustrating phone_calls to resolve .
neutral	item seems good , but wall fixings not really suitable .
neutral	i received an_email with a 00_%_off code and then tried to place an order .
neutral	it would not go through either using debit_card or paypal , i kept getting an error about my address .
neutral	in the end i had to phone my order in and was told i wouldn_'_t be able to use my 00_% code .
neutral	if i '_m unable to place an order online next time i '_ll probably go elsewhere .
neutral	when we turned in our rental_car in dusseldorf the guy wanted to charge us 000_euros as a cleaning fee because he said the inside of the car was dirty .
neutral	of course it was dirty .
neutral	we had the car for three_weeks .
neutral	we had some trash neatly stored in the back on the floor and the floors were dirty on the driver and passengers side from where our feet were sitting for 0_weeks .
neutral	then the guy tried to say we had a dog in the car because he found some of my wife '_s hair in the back of the car .
neutral	we had a blanket stored in the back so the hair probably fell_off that .
neutral	i asked_him for a vaccum and a trash can .
neutral	he provided neither .
neutral	i apologized to him for leaving my shop vac in the united_states .
neutral	( joke ) my wife had a shopping bag that i loaded the trash into and i pulled the floor_mats out and tapped the dirt off of them .
neutral	this took all of two minutes .
neutral	by this time the supervisor had show up .
neutral	he told the other employee that it was fine and not to charge me anything .
neutral	this event started my 00 hour trip home with a bit of un needed stress .
neutral	at_least it didn_'_t cost me any extra money in the end .
neutral	the trees i ordered were supposed to be around 0 feet tall .
neutral	there actually sticks about 0 feet tall .
neutral	planted them anyway .
neutral	the headlight we purchased was at a great price but no instructions .
neutral	the light came to us severely out of adjustment , the headlight shines on the ground instead of straightaway with no instruction on how to adjust .
neutral	we are still trying to find out how to adjust the new light .
neutral	it wouldn_'_t have required much to have included some instructions
neutral	can '_t give a review because for some reason i had to sign_up and now wait 00 - 00_hours for my reports to load ..
neutral	i '_ve pulled credit before it '_s instant so so_far ...
neutral	i '_m not very haply
neutral	ordered ' in stock ' item ( 0 ) 0 . 00am monday .
neutral	telephoned for progress of order on thursday as shower pump was leaking .
neutral	i was told item was out of stock and the vendor would have new stock either the next_day or monday .
neutral	the next_day ( friday ) the item arrived by royal_mail so obviously must have been in stock and already posted when i telephoned !
neutral	very confusing but i was pleased to receive item which was well_packaged .
neutral	did not carry out the instructions that i gave .
neutral	we purchase gift_cards for our publishing partners , and the virtual ones are quite convenient .
neutral	i will say , however , that the themes and accompanying creative that are available for this product are completely bizarre .
neutral	note , in april , here are the options : valentine '_s day , birthday , congratulations , and thinking of you .
neutral	why not have a plain card ( perhaps with no animation ) that does not have a highly specific occasion ?
neutral	what about , simply " thank_you " or no theme ?
neutral	they didn_'_t tell us that the deposit is added into your receipt for price paid , so we spent several days thinking they had overcharged us , and spent time trying to find a europcar location to complain to while we were out on the road .
neutral	hopefully they did refund the money ( around 000_euros ) afterwards .... not sure yet , as we just got back .
neutral	partsgeek do a great job except for shipping by fedex only .
neutral	fedex holds a shipment for days until they get several shipments to my okc suburb .
neutral	ups brings anything out the day it arrives in their hub .
neutral	sure wish partsgeek would ship ups .
neutral	some great deals to be had on a variety of great products .
neutral	one hiccup which has yet o be resolved
neutral	got some things reversed
neutral	the item we ordered ( hoover hurricane 0000 ) is now in use and we are very satisfied with both the price and the performance .
neutral	unfortunately following order_placement there was a two week delay before we realised all was not well .
neutral	this could have been avoided if an order tracking_system were in place .
neutral	once alerted to the problem ( lost item with shipper ?)
neutral	it took two_days to arrive .
neutral	will use again but be more attentive to order progress .
neutral	don_'_t even think about using a company which uses this delivery agent !!!
neutral	drivers are terrible , deceitful and do not do the job as agreed .
neutral	0 june_0000 - well the customer service ( cs ) has picked this one up and i am assured they are working on the delivery service .
neutral	if the delivery service was to be just a fraction of the standard offered by customer service there would be no_complaints at all .
neutral	upgraded from one to three stars thanks to cs .
neutral	0 june_0000 - received an nice surprise of shopping vouchers in compensation for the terrible delivery .
neutral	hoping there will be an improvement in the delivery service .
neutral	after installation of the winker assies at the rear of my bike , i noticed color difference in both winker assies .
neutral	i '_ve used bitdefender for several_years and have been happy with it .
neutral	it '_s much_better_than mcafee or norton .
neutral	and then suddenly in the past few_months i started getting these large , intrusive , pop - up ads coming out of nowhere , asking me if i want to upgrade ( or words to that affect ).
neutral	i like to game , and these ads literally blow my game out of the water , forcing it to minimize on my screen and look at the damn ad !
neutral	i lost over an_hour of game effort the other day because of this !
neutral	so i complained to bitdefender and explained the issue .
neutral	what i got back was an_email from their support telling_me that bitdefender sees its " emergency messaging " system as an important mechanism for communicating serious problems to customers ( again , words to that effect ).
neutral	i wrote them back and said that i did not think any advertisement warranted an " emergency " message of any kind , ever .
neutral	sad to say , but i will be shopping around their competition before i resubscribe again .
neutral	fast order , but package arrived partially open and no invoice
neutral	prices are great , product selection is also quite impessive , the only problem is getting the product to the customer .
neutral	either they move slow at the lab or sent it to you by camel .
neutral	your delivery time after ordering is gonna be the straw that is gonna break your camels back .
neutral	many other_companys with the same type of product and quality have much , much_quicker shipping times .
neutral	i know because i had to order another pair from one of those companies and they got my glasses to me before you did .
neutral	even_though i placed my order after yours .
neutral	i have a hatred for unnecessary plastic packaging , bags etc .
neutral	and this parcel had lots ofit .
neutral	most wasn_'_t needed and what may have been needed could have been submitted for paper bags , ie bio - degradable .
neutral	land fill costs everyone .
neutral	attempted to book however after booking was reading thru the fine_print to find out its an adult only hotel .
neutral	my husband was taking my dtr to new_york city for the first time for her 0th birthday .
neutral	so disappointed that the " adult only " wasn_'_t more obvious before booking .
neutral	i waited over 0_weeks for my frames to be shipped internationally only to learn then that the frames were discontinued .
neutral	poor communication between manufacturer and simplyeyeglasses .
neutral	i have used priceline successfully for years .
neutral	recently my successful bid on a hotel stay in hawaii was only dampened by my winning bid for a rental_car .
neutral	you have to think about whether or not you need a rental_car cause once you bid successfully , there are no refunds .
neutral	priceline refuses to provide customer service on refunds or last_minute change of mind .
neutral	i have one issue - i orderered in anticipation of the oil turning_up in 00 working days - in the event it was 0 days and as a cosequence i could not take delivery of the full order as the tank was full .
neutral	in previous times the opposite has happened and taken full 00 days when i needed it before . there must be a way of sorting that out !
neutral	the website was easy to use .
neutral	pricing competitive , but shipping and handling pricing could be better .
neutral	i sometimes get a better deal with other_suppliers .
neutral	this is my first time using supplement_warehouse so we will see how they fulfill my order in a timely_manner .
neutral	the product was fine but the box was destroyed .
neutral	i have pictures .
neutral	o dont_know if i will use u again because of the way the box looked when it arrived .
neutral	i recommend identity_guard as quick way to monitor your identity & credit .
neutral	however , there are other resources available for low_cost or free if you are willing to put in the extra effort .
neutral	all of these are built into identity_guard .
neutral	so they do the work for you .
neutral	but you don_'_t absolutely need this credit_monitoring to perform the services yourself .
neutral	i booked this room for my mom & sister for our wedding in vegas .
neutral	they checked out the following_morning .
neutral	there was a major problem with the billing .
neutral	also , they told me their room was unacceptable , unsanitary , and had no towels .
neutral	the only bad thing is that the shipping_charges begin to add up .
neutral	most will waive the shipping_charges if you order so much .
neutral	here the more you order the more the shipping .
neutral	the shipping_charges can be nearly_half as much as the order .
neutral	hello i am canadian and as such do not have access to the parts network available to you americans .
neutral	i attempted to buy from you but because you don_'_t ship to canada i am forced to spend elsewhere .
neutral	please_let_me know if your policy changes .
neutral	wish the shipping_charges didnt pertain to each idividual part .. i ordered two gaskets and was charged $_00 shipping on each_individual part although they both came in one box .. thats rediculous .. next time i will keep . my mo ey in the local parts store ..
neutral	renting the car for 000_dollars only to find that i needed to pay nearly 000_dollars in fees ( origination fee of 00 euro for pricing the car up from the airport ) was a big disappointment .
neutral	would not have done this if i new .
neutral	further no_problems .
neutral	good car
neutral	i ordered two packs of identical t - shirts , assuming that they would be delivered in one parcel - " silly me ".
neutral	delivery was by dpd ( uk ).
neutral	the on - line tracking process was effective and i was emailed an expected delivery time on a specified date .
neutral	" great ", i thought , " i will tell my wife ( at home ) so that she can be available ".
neutral	an_hour or so later , i received a second email from dpd advising me of an earlier delivery time .
neutral	" driver must be making good time ", i thought , " i '_ll tell my wife ".
neutral	the delivery was made , my wife signed for it , and then she went shopping .
neutral	around 0 hours_later , dpd attempted to make a second delivery , unsuccessfully , and returned it to their depot .
neutral	so i had to collect it from the depot ~ 0 days_later , via a ~ 00 mile_round_trip .
neutral	confusion !
neutral	julesb had packed identical ( soft ) goods in two_separate parcels !
neutral	dpd '_s delivery routing process apparently failed to recognise two consignments to the same address on the same day , presumably via different vans about 0 hours apart !
neutral	contacted dpd via_email , but no customer service & no_explanation .
neutral	very pleased with the t - shirts , but will be wary about ordering again , unless i '_m buying only one item !
neutral	i purchased two new front tyres ( toyo open country highway terrain ~£ 000 each incl vat ) for my rav0 via the blackcircles website , to be fitted by one of the recommended local_garages ( alpha & yapps , llanishen , cardiff ).
neutral	i had nominated the fitting date ( which was ok ), but blackcircles nominated the appointment time at 00 : 00 , which was a little early but manageable .
neutral	i received a slightly sleepy , but polite , welcome at the garage ( that was apparently just opening ).
neutral	the fitting went ok ; took about an_hour , while i waited in the quite cramped corner of the reception_area .
neutral	on driving away from the garage ( in moderate snow / sleet ), the steering seemed slightly heavier than usual , but not alarming and i assumed it might be the different tyres .
neutral	the downside occurred about 00_hours after the fitting , when i noticed the offside front tyre looked a little soft ( sidewall bulging more than usual at ground level ).
neutral	i didn_'_t have a pressure gauge nor pump , so i left the situation until i got home in the evening .
neutral	at that point , i realised that the tyre had deflated to below 00_psi ( normal pressure ~ 00_psi ).
neutral	there seemed to be three ( or four ) possible causes ; either a puncture , grit in tyre valve causing a seepage of air , faulty seal between wheel_rim and tyre , or under - inflated tyre from the garage which may have contributed to any faulty seal .
neutral	my model of rav0 doesn_'_t have a spare tyre ( crazy !
neutral	), so i reinflated the tyre with my battery powered pump , mainly_because i wasn_'_t going anywhere otherwise , and to see what would happen next .
neutral	fortunately the tyre stayed inflated , so it wasn_'_t a puncture .
neutral	the " fault " seems to have been cured , but it remains a mystery .
neutral	a few points : ( i ) it suggests that the fault was associated with some aspect of the tyre_fitting ; ( ii ) the tyre could have deflated and / or been damaged more dramatically with ( i guess ) no acceptance of responsibility from the garage ; ( iii ) if i didn_'_t have a tyre pump at home , a solution would have been at_least inconvenient and possibly costly .
neutral	although there was no_drama , i suggest that it '_s a situation to note .
neutral	i may , or may not , use the garage again depending_on choice / optimism at the time !
neutral	i have used amazon quite a few_times .
neutral	a little harder of a website to use , and have had complications with services and coupons they have offered .
neutral	everything works well , the site is relatively easy to use but to organise results on price then add a booking_fee later is incredibly annoying .
neutral	twice i have called with queries on my account and each time , they claimed i did not have an account with them .
neutral	grrrr ...
neutral	very good price , item shown as in stock at time of purchase through website , after waiting for a week , i had to call them to find out that it was not infact in stock , and would have to wait nearly a month for it be delivered , also the strap i wanted was not in stock so substited for another , and its not as good .
neutral	nice_touch to include a freebie a fender clip on tuner ( that does not work ) so yeh thanks for that , also noticed an odd blue_chip to the headstock of the guitar , not part of the cosmetic aging me thinks !
neutral	so yeh nothing special , hey this is britain , we are all used to paying over the odds and recieving below_average service .
neutral	slow delivered clubs .
neutral	not ub stock
neutral	received order on time , opened outer_box and found that the inner box seal had been cut and the box had been opened , missing the manufacturers_warranty and instructions .
neutral	notified pk and was informed to contact manufacturer for the paper_work .
neutral	i believe that this item was a return to pk and reshipped to me minus the paper_work .
neutral	pk also said that i could return the item , get credit and then reorder .
neutral	i needed the part now , not in the time it would take for the part to be returned and reordered and not to say the expense if any .
neutral	the item was suppose to be new as_advertised .
neutral	maybe a little better quality assurance could have helped out in this matter
neutral	i purchased the xtremeair pox0 00 " hood with the 00 ' ceiling extension from mainfaucet . com .
neutral	in jan_0000 .
neutral	while the on - line purchase / delivery experience was smooth , unfortunately the product sold was not what i expected .
neutral	the installation guide / owner '_s manual is of poor quality because it is missing information , misleading , and sometimes just_plain hard to understand ( because of the poor_english -- everything is made in china , even the manual , despite xtremeair wrapping themselves in the u . s . flag on their website ).
neutral	there were no instructions regarding the 00 ' ceiling extension , the instructions on the support brackets were contrary to the drawings which were confusing , and the lights are not very bright even_though there are 0 -- they are only 0 - watt bulbs !
neutral	i eventually got it installed just fine , but the quality was not what i expected after shelling_out almost $_0k for that hood .
neutral	one corner of the glass hood appears to be either chipped or deformed , the xtremeair company logo placards ( which are prominently stuck to the front and back on the control_panel ) are scratched , pitted , and look cheap , the sheet_metal surrounding the fan was bent and had to be straightened to facilitate clean airflow .... etc .
neutral	overall , not the quality i expected for the money paid .
neutral	i also didn_'_t get anyone '_s attention at xtremeair until i asked for return instructions because of warranty issues .
neutral	then they were ready to help ... aaaarghh .
neutral	where is the quality made - in - america stuff of the last generation ?
neutral	good products but the pictures looks better_than the reality ...
neutral	purchased a air mass sensor for 0000_kia at a price of $_000 which i assumed was a great price based on my previous purchases from parts_geek , but while researching the installation procedures online , i found the same part for $_00 .
neutral	based on parts_geek '_s price statement that they researched to insure they had the lowest_price and the fact that the price i paid was so much higher , i sent an_email to customer service with a link to the web_page showing the item .
neutral	i received an_email from them in which they said : hello ' thanks .
neutral	no other comments or explanation .
neutral	i purchased low budget wireless cctv cameras unfortunately due to wireless interference not able to use as part of the recording system based on motion detection which is probably function of price .
neutral	website and delivery better_than_expected .
neutral	good glasses but very slow on the shipping .
neutral	they did not get me my glasses when they said they would .
neutral	i ordered flowers on line for my wife as i am in afghanistan on tour , i could not complete purchase unless i gave a valid phone_number and as i '_m in afghanistan with no phone i gave my wife '_s number instead .
neutral	it stated on the website this would only be used if there was difficulty with delivery and also stated an_email would be sent for proof of purchase .
neutral	at no time did it state a text_message would be sent at any time resulting in my wife receiving a message straight_away upon_completion of purchase .
neutral	i did send a email to the company but have not recieved any reply .
neutral	flowers where lovely and delivered promptly .
neutral	please state u will b sending text_message to number provided as it ruined a nice surprise .
neutral	the machine was delivered on time , constant up - dates sent by text to my mobile_phone .
neutral	realy great service , thank_you .
neutral	paid to have the old machine taken_away .
neutral	this was also realy good and well_worth the extra_cost .
neutral	paid_extra for the fitting .
neutral	not so good .
neutral	the " drain " hose required a converter fitting to join the existing connection to the machine pipe .
neutral	the " fitters " refused to wait the 00_minutes it took me to purchase this converter from my local_hardware shop and were gone by the time i returned .
neutral	as a result i had to pay another company to fit the machine under my work surface .
neutral	it is a tight fit and as a pensioner beyond my ability to lift , shove and move by myself .
neutral	this part of the deal was not what it should be and i would reccomend not paying for this " service " as a local_fitter will do the job quicker and you will not have to pay twice for the job to be carried_out .
neutral	i have been contacted by trustpilot this afternoon ( 00 . 00 . 0000 .)
neutral	and they have appologised and promised to refund the " instalation " charge .
neutral	once again very good service and i forgot to mention the price .
neutral	the best available either on the high_street or anywhere on the web .
neutral	thank_you all
neutral	my order for 00 sheets of 0mm twinwall 0000 x 000 was dealt_with very efficiantly .
neutral	however 0 sheets were found to be onlt 000mm wide so not fit for purpose . a phone_call i made on monday 0nd april_0000 was also answered_promptly and i was told 0 replacement sheets would be despatched to arrive next_day . when not received 0 days_later another phone_call brought the news that panels out of stock . delivery not now expected until newt tuesday . why did nobody think to e_mail me this information .
neutral	if a quick chech of measurements had been made prior to despatch this promlem would not have arisen
neutral	very unhappy that a collection time cannot be
neutral	provided by your company .
neutral	they are professional in there service .
neutral	since i recieved the wrong part , i should not have to pay the return shipping .
neutral	000 - 000 - 0000
neutral	i went to town_fair_tire in southington ct .
neutral	yesterday 0 - 00 - 0000 .
neutral	i asked the manager if they could fix a slow_leak in my left rear tire .
neutral	the technician took off my tire and he showed me where i had a leak , they said that they can '_t fix it because the small nail was a little close to the side wall .
neutral	they said that by law they can '_t put a plug in it .
neutral	but the salesman did try to talking me into byeing a set of 0 new tires .
neutral	i told them to put my tire back on my car .
neutral	i have at_least another 00 , 000_miles on all 0 tires left , plenty of tread left .
neutral	i asked the mgr .
neutral	if he will pro rate my tires and give me a discount on 0 new tires .
neutral	he said no right off the bat and didn_'_t even discuss with me about working a deal .
neutral	i also told them that i have called the 000 # at the bottom of your paper order with nothing but good news on how they have treated me and my cars and truck in the past few_years .
neutral	the mgr did say that it '_s because of my tires brand_name they have had nothing but trouble with the maker my tires are michelin_tires .
neutral	i always check my psi = 00 lbs .
neutral	and keep them up to date .
neutral	i felt this mgr just wanted to sell me new tires , but i didn_'_t fall for his pitch .
neutral	i would like to see more offers with a higer percentages off your products , and also your offers emailed to customes !
neutral	my very first order took about a month or so to get to me .
neutral	for some reason it went to sweden first .
neutral	chemical couldn_'_t explain_why it would have gone this route .
neutral	it eventually got to me but of all the uk orders i '_ve placed over the years i '_ve never had this happen before .
neutral	00 . 00 to check a bag 00 . 00 to pick your seat and all had to be done online because if you didnt the fee '_s were higher at the airport
neutral	nach doch vielen aufdeckenden geschichten über_die verhältnisse bei dem riesen anbieter amazon und_das ausnutzen von mitarbeitern , hatte ich dem online shop eigentlich abgeschworen .
neutral	teuflischerweise kommt man doch immer_wieder darauf zurück , denn amazon hat einfach eine riesige produktpalette , bietet gute preise und zuverlässigkeit
neutral	ordered 0 o0_sensors from same warehouse and got 0 a couple days after order then other 0 came a week_later !!!!!!
neutral	!
neutral	i really_liked how easy it was to compare the prices at the different units .
neutral	however i reserved one through the website and when i got to the storage_facility there were none the size i reserved available and hadnt been for some time .
neutral	i was informed that sparefoot doesnt inquire_about rental availability just what size of units the facility has .
neutral	great product , delivered on time and fitted .
neutral	the fitting went a bit wrong but after a moan they sorted it out .
neutral	happened to be last thing on a friday and i think the guys wanted to get off .
neutral	i went to parts_geek because they had the part i needed for a good price , but there '_s a problem with shipping .
neutral	it '_s sooo slow .
neutral	my part came from california on ground_shipping .
neutral	i ended returning the part because i bought one at my local store .
neutral	the company seems to be headquartered in nj so i thought shipping might be 0 - 0 days but the part was shipped from cali .
neutral	i would have been out of a car for almost 0 days .
neutral	the return experience was fine though .
neutral	seems like they get it .
neutral	my local_napa had my part the same day and they had to go to the warehouse for it .
neutral	the general look and navigation of the site is good .
neutral	the ability to filter and sort the products displayed is useful .
neutral	the big bug bearer fir me us that you cannot browse on
neutral	the site to select what you want , and when you have found
neutral	the right product you cannot reserve it at the store to collect .
neutral	the only option is for delivery at a cost , and as i live relatively
neutral	close i would prefer to collect , but when there is limited
neutral	stock the assurance of a reservation would be better .
neutral	the service , price and item were all excellent , however i requested a different delivery address to my home address which they failed to observe .
neutral	the item i purchased was a 0 piece chrome rear_bumper .
neutral	the parts were not finished off well and one had a uneven edge .
neutral	some holes were not in the exact place and had to be driled out .
neutral	the three pieces did not fit to each other well and left a 0 / 0 gap .
neutral	the chrome is dimpled where the bumper supports were welded on the inside .
neutral	the bumper was only 0 / 0 price of the dealer original_equipment and is fine for an_older vehicle that is not worth spending a lot to maintain .
neutral	as i wanted a whey_protein without lactose i chose pro - 00 .
neutral	it '_s very powdery and isn_'_t nice tasting at all .
neutral	however , i '_ve noticed it '_s doing the job and my body can digest it much_easier than whey containing lactose .
neutral	if you find you ' re a bit intolerant like me then pro - 00 is a good bet .
neutral	i found dealing_with fhr very smooth - they had the best price i could find after a lot of searching , however , did require i call them to make the booking ( as i needed it same day ) which was a pain and it was an 0000 number which is costly .
neutral	confirmation e_-_mails were spot on .
neutral	the main issue i had was that on approaching the car_park at liverpool - my numberplate wasn_'_t recognised and when i spoke to security they said they had no record of my booking .
neutral	obviously the link between the carpark and fhr isn_'_t instantaneous which is problematic and un - nerving .
neutral	the carpark let_me in anyway and said i should speak to the car_park desk on my return .
neutral	i did this , and by that time , the booking was on their system so i exited with no_problems .
neutral	however , i did have to spend my trip wondering_whether i could get out of the car_park or not ....
neutral	i would recommend using this service , as it was the best price and did all eventually work out - however , to avoid any uncertainty - book as much in advance as you can .
neutral	i ordered a samsung bd - f000 when i recieved a totaly incorect item that was in the f000 box .
neutral	the manager at the beeston srore acted very quickly and aranfed for collection abd a full_refund ( i am awating said refund ).
neutral	i think you shiuld cgeck more carefully what you ar selling before desoatch .
neutral	but aoart from that it was goid service
neutral	i ordered a front grille for my 0000_subaru .
neutral	it arrived quickly , but in a half opened box .
neutral	the shipping tape was not on securely and the side of the box was torn .
neutral	sure_enough , an end tab was broken on the top of the grille .
neutral	the box had plastic air bags for cushioning ... and not enough of it .
neutral	from the scale of 0 to 00 , shipping gets a 0 .
neutral	i installed the new grille with the broken tab anyway because i don_'_t want to deal with the return process .
neutral	sad .
neutral	the first flight and car were perfect !
neutral	i had to take_care of other business and when i came back to your site the exact_same flight had gone up over $_000 without the car !
neutral	now i am having to fly from a different airport and still paying more .
neutral	we have used driveaway to rent_cars in france and greece more than once per year for at_least the last five years .
neutral	the important_thing to remember is they are only as good as their suppliers .
neutral	we keep having negative experiences with europcar in france booked though driveaway , although we have to acknowledge that the prices you get with europcar with driveaway are great .
neutral	problems are :
neutral	long_queues - 00_minutes at charles de gaulle last_year .
neutral	0 hrs 00_minutes at marseilles this year .
neutral	class - what you book is not what you get !
neutral	( this is what or similar means ) for france in the last two years we have booked mercedes_c000 .
neutral	have had 0 .
neutral	mercedes 000 , 0 .
neutral	volvo w00 ( wagon ) 0 . mercedes 000 auto ( an upgrade !)
neutral	0 .
neutral	peugeot_000 wagon ( booked auto mercedes_c000 )
neutral	shifty behaviour .
neutral	an " unmarked " car often has scratches .
neutral	be absolutely careful .
neutral	inspect , report back and photograph everything .
neutral	when they are " busy ", you need to be_careful .
neutral	i needed an ignition_lock and keys which was in stock .
neutral	the title said lock and keys but no where in the description did it say 0 keys and the picture looked like there was only one key .
neutral	i asked customer service and they emailed me back and said all their locks only had one key .
neutral	i went to a another website ( your competition ) and they had a video which clearly showed two keys - one inside the lock and one outside .
neutral	i ordered the part and received it promptly ( with two keys ).
neutral	price match offer i found misleading .
neutral	i wanted to purchase 0 items , 0 of which appliances_online were the cheapest the third product i had found £_00 cheaper online .
neutral	the operator validated the price but then said because they couldnt deliver as quick as appliances_online they would not match the price .
neutral	the fact was the rival had it in stock but they only made one delivery per week to my postcode that was 0 days_later than the appliances_online scheduled delivery .
neutral	slow replies - needs to improve
neutral	tyres_fitted the day after the booked date due to late delivery of the tyres
neutral	this was my first purchase with whisky_exchange .
neutral	you have to " join / register " - ( boring ).
neutral	the order processing was ok .
neutral	but if you change your mind ( as i did ) and ordered more , the updating process takes a while to master .
neutral	what spoiled the experience was the courier company .
neutral	i was sent a link to be able to track my order - but the link would not connect .
neutral	i gained access to their system through the website which said i was being delivered by overnite courier - when i had ordered 0 day .
neutral	so i stayed in to receive the delivery and ( of course ) it did not come overnite .
neutral	it arrived on the 0th day ( as ordered ).
neutral	and that was the only day i could get access to the courier tracking_system - too_late !
neutral	!
neutral	the return flight from corn island to managua was delayed some two and a half hours .
neutral	no information was given at the airport either in spanish or english .
neutral	i understand that delays will happen , but it is important to inform your passengers what has happened and when they can expect to arrive at their destination .
neutral	aside from that i had a good experience with flying with your airline .
neutral	it takes_forever to get what you order .
neutral	i get things faster from china .
neutral	outstanding that a human answers the phone .
neutral	not great that i was referred to the manufacturer when the winter_cover was short .
neutral	received a parcel that was not sealed down and one of the product packages was open .
neutral	not good , especially when dealing_with animal medicines .
neutral	on reporting this to vet -_medic they were extremely apologetic and sent me out a replacement order immediately .
neutral	i would deal with this company again as one of my acid tests on company performance is after sales support and for this i would award them 0_stars .
neutral	these things_happen .
neutral	when writing to customer service , since there is a 0 hour time difference ( i am in nyc ), the response back takes at_least a day .
neutral	why this matters : for my particular order i made a mistake on sizing and wrote to customer service a minute after i had placed the order online to make a change .
neutral	because of the time difference , the order had shipped already by the time customer service showed_up for work , so they could not make the requested change .
neutral	i asked them if they would cover shipping back to them for an exchange considering i had let them know near immediately after i had placed the order .
neutral	their response was : no .
neutral	my question is this : why does super dry ship from the uk , when they have a presence here in the states ?
neutral	this limits what the company can do for returns ( one must pay for shipping items back , fill_out custom form , which is time_consuming and expensive b /_c items must ship internationally ).
neutral	would i order from super dry again online ?
neutral	definitely not .
neutral	i am an_avid gamer , and i have games on origin , steam .
neutral	uplay , gog , desura and other services .
neutral	i just upgraded my computer , and it was really easy to copy over my old gog games ( drm free !
neutral	), and also just plug in my old steam drive and reinstall steam over the top , keeping my old games and saving several terabytes worth of downloading .
neutral	orign on the other hand , is a nightmare .
neutral	copying over old files doesn_'_t save you any downloading , and the service is quite quirky about moving the download folder to another drive .
neutral	in addition , some games , such as the sims , are a nightmare to patch .
neutral	if you ' re going to be forced to use a drm service to download / install games , then why do you have to install patches separately , and incrementally to get certain games to work ?
neutral	origin is getting better - it '_s not too bloated these days and the game pricing can be decent , but i wish it would check to see if you already had some game files to save you downloads .
neutral	there '_s an excellent choice of skinz to suit pretty_much anybody .
neutral	the print quality is excellent and the skin itself is pretty durable .
neutral	i found that the cut - outs for my galaxy s 0 were slightly off , just a couple of mm but enough to obscure the front camera a bit so i was forced to leave the front cover off .
neutral	otherwise it '_s excellent .
neutral	i orderd two parts that were in stock one came quick other did not come as quick .
neutral	not sure why , they were practically the exact_same part .
neutral	left tie_rod and right tie_rod .
neutral	even if they came from two different_warehouses i '_ve had one part for a week and i am still_waiting on the second .
neutral	other than that , i ' d probably order from them again
neutral	it came on time and was cheap .
neutral	the website itself is pretty good and easy to navigate .
neutral	however , they don_'_t communicate with the on - site storage location very well .
neutral	i spend a lot of time arguing with the management of the site over the arrangements that were made online .
neutral	it seems that they had no_idea what i was talking_about and couldn_'_t find the online agreement until i sent them a copy of my e_-_mail_stating these arrangements .
neutral	this is a problem that needs to be looked into and resolved .
neutral	i like the coffee but i think its way over priced !
neutral	i like the credit_monitoring but you need to do something about how members do minor changes to their account .
neutral	in order to change an address , which takes a couple minutes with any other vendor , for identity_guard it takes a minimum of 00_minutes .
neutral	once you get through waiting on hold , you then have to answer at_least five security questions .
neutral	i understand the need to be secure but it '_s excessive .
neutral	this issue has caused me to consider canceling my account more than once .
neutral	it ´_s very good , and has done effects
neutral	an excellent product .
neutral	however , it was not delivered on the day it was supposed to be ( it was a day late ).
neutral	consequently i missed the delivery as i was out at work .
neutral	the courier company used was not particularly helpful or accommodating as regards redelivery and in the end i had to schlepp miles to an industrial_estate to pick_up my parcel .
neutral	sending it via_royal_mail would have been much_better as they are more flexible than cut - priced couriers and have more places to pick_up from .
neutral	once again , proof of the argument : couriers suit the retailer but not the customer !
neutral	i did a search to book online with country inns and suites and somehow ended_up with this service even thought the web_page indicated that i was on country inns and suites .
neutral	this site charges your credit_card immediately for full price .
neutral	i tried to cancel my reservation and through ci & s and was surprised that they did not have my reservation and was first directed to expedia and i finally found out who to call by trying different numbers .
neutral	when i finally found the right person to talk to , they were helpful and cancelled my reservation .
neutral	when i received my cancellation email , it said that the had charged my credit_card for the full_amount .
neutral	i again called to confirm that they would refund my money and the assured they would , but it my take up to 00 days .
neutral	i will wait as see .
neutral	hopefully i will never find out either how good or otherwise your policy actually is as it means something will have gone wrong but knowing coverage is there and is on the " which " magazine gives some peace of mind
neutral	the shirts we ordered the first time are still going strong !
neutral	this time i encountered a rather pushy and impatient designer .
neutral	but hey .
neutral	as long as the shirts look great , no_complaints !
neutral	i bought new_mood and alpha_brain .
neutral	i noticed a little difference with alpha_brain , i was more alert and focused but only until around noon ; i think they should make another dose around noon to get full performance .
neutral	i haven_'_t much or anything from the new moon , i did sleep like a baby one night but nothing more than that .
neutral	the price is a little_steep but with about a month on alpha_brain with an increased dosage it might work very well .
neutral	sent wrong flavour but speedy_delivery
neutral	i changed my rental reservation to a " deal " that traleocity promoted which implies a one or two - step upgrade from the compact class .
neutral	when i got to orlando , no upgrade was given .
neutral	our_luggage barely fit into the car we got .
neutral	i was able to order what i wanted from the website however i would like to see you stock skins ......... delivery was slow and when i received my package it was damaged and the packet containing the ball pump needles i ordered was split_open and one was missing and the other was taped to the box !
neutral	not good .
neutral	i did not want to go through the hassle of calling for a £ 0 . 00 item but will bear it in mind before ordering anything further from barrington .
neutral	over all great .
neutral	- i have sold a number of things to b_&_h .
neutral	i have read that the shipping is free , but when the label is emailed , it is not a paid shipping_label .
neutral	also ordering can be complicated .
neutral	i have tried to change my address several_times , but things keep getting mailed to my previous address .
neutral	i also have a canon rebate card and in order to use it on your site , i have to re enter my old address .
neutral	had no problem so_far with this purchase , ( will wait to see if they honour my trade - in voucher against this sale !)
neutral	emailed their customer_support prior to purchase , but they still have not replied to this email .
neutral	went_ahead with purchase .
neutral	all went_smoothly , and item turned_up next_day .
neutral	nice and quick .
neutral	lovely lens in immaculate_condition , just a shame it came in the wrong protective bag .
neutral	this all said , i will probably use this site again .
neutral	i '_ve had a couple of good dealings with blackcircles .
neutral	this time only one of two tyres were delivered to the fitting_garage .
neutral	it meant time spent tracking the missing tyre and another afternoon trip to the garage to get second tyre fitted .. twice as time_consuming !
neutral	travelocity is my favorite on line travel_agent ; however , a recent experience has made my guarded .
neutral	i found a round_trip to istanbul from cleveland with a stop over in madrid as separate round trips for three of us , including a 0 year_old .
neutral	i called a travel advisor , whose english was halting , to see if he could avoid the extra overnight that was part of my two round trips ( cleveland - madrid ; madrid - istanbul ).
neutral	after 00_minutes he came up with what he said was the best alternative .
neutral	this alternative involved several connections and was more_expensive than my arrangement .
neutral	he was " unable to locate " the non stop turkish airlines flight and to get his best rates we lost three vacation days .
neutral	his arrangement for all flights with american_airlines made me suspect favoring a specific airline - to travelocities economic advantage .
neutral	i had to pay a fee for the advice which i had to accept as the other flights filled during my communication with the agent .
neutral	travelocity needs to make stop over trips easily_accessed on line .
neutral	i sent them a complaint and never received a response .
neutral	i was ordering a lens from here and just wanted to double_check on that i was correct in ordering the lens .
neutral	wanted to talk to a physical person but no one was around .
neutral	i '_ve been using avast for many_years , and it '_s good antivirus .
neutral	there is better out there , but you certainly have to pay for it .
neutral	avast '_s main failings is that it '_s no_longer a lean , mean program which does one thing really well .
neutral	instead , it tries to be many things in one , and as a result , it '_s becoming a bit of a pig size - wize .
neutral	thankfully some of the things can be installed as an option during a custom install , or can be removed once you make the mistake of express installing this package .
neutral	it '_s also a bit_slower_than one of the top - rated antivirus programs .
neutral	the default behavior of avast for windows is to annoy the user .
neutral	in order to get maximum annoyance reduction , you have to delve into the many options , to weed_out the annoyances .
neutral	overall , it does a good job , but there was one update which caused computers to reboot without_warning , a feature which can certainly wind people and entire organizations in big trouble .
neutral	i '_ve never been hit with a false positive , especially critical os and driver files , so i '_ve always been able to boot into a useable system .
neutral	avast '_s support for scanning encrypted email connections is braindead .
neutral	this thing gets in the way of everything , including non_- encrypted email connections .
neutral	i '_ve had to sort out problems with people '_s email software not being_able to send / receive email on more than one occasion .
neutral	the latest_version of avast has adopted ugly windows 0 styling .
neutral	windows 0 styling gives people with no artistic bones in their body a chance to make something that looks as boring and en par with everyone_else '_s software , in other_words , quite generic looking .
neutral	overall , i recommend it , but 0_stars is too much in my humble_opinion .
neutral	there is certainly room for improvement , and avast should realize what their target is - antivirus .
neutral	i don_'_t want yet another software firewall , nor do i want something which breaks email of its own volition .
neutral	lean and mean .
neutral	is that so much to ask ?
neutral	i ' d pay for lean and mean , i won_'_t pay for bloat .
neutral	i have 0 packages coming this 00 of october , but , one of the packages does not have tracking references at all , and , i was informed by ups that they are not aware of this package with a tracking_number at all . i was not informed by e_-_mail and i have sent an e_-_mail to find out what happened with it . i have appt , with my shop for this tuesday the 00 . if i lost my appt . with the shop without having all my parts with me , it will be the last time i will buy something with your company . somebody drop the ball on this , and , i '_m not happy with it !!
neutral	!
neutral	parts_geek had the part i needed at a really good price ; even with shipping and handling , it was very reasonable .
neutral	the part also arrived in a short_amount of time .
neutral	thanks parts_geek !
neutral	useful site .
neutral	not sure all available storage_facilities were shown .
neutral	given that a vw parts warehouse is located in the metro area delivery was exceptionally quick .
neutral	however , since someone doesn_'_t know how to package a part , a corner of the lower front skid_plate i had ordered for my 0000 passat was cracked .
neutral	some outdoor black duct_tape took_care of that .
neutral	it all too common today that no matter who you order parts from the packaging is horrendous .
neutral	throw it in a box and send it on its way seems to be the standard procedure .
neutral	our experience did not get off to a good start .
neutral	we took a taxi to the address on our booking sheet .
neutral	this turned_out to be the garage only and we were advised to walk ( with all of our_luggage ) about three blocks to the agency office .
neutral	after completing the required paperwork we were told we now had to walk back to the garage ( why was the car not brought to us or why did the garage attendant not tell us to leave our_luggage while we went to complete the paperwork ).
neutral	when we arrived back at the garage ( again having walked with all of our_luggage ) the car was waiting blocking the sidewalk and partially parked on the roadway .
neutral	this left little opportunity to inspect the vehicle .
neutral	also , the car was a full_sized volvo when we had booked a smaller mercedes .
neutral	the attendant told us there was only a half tank of fuel and it was to be returned with the same .
neutral	upon return of the car to the rome_airport facility i had more than a half tank of fuel and i was advised by the check - in attendant that everything was acceptable .
neutral	however , on our return home we received an_additional_charge on our credit_card for about $_000 . 00 for refuelling and an_additional_fee for that service .
neutral	when i called to complain i was told i have to send all receipts etc .
neutral	and the bill would be reviewed .
neutral	this is a lot of trouble fo me for a questionable billing practice on the part of europecar .
neutral	when i return to europe next year i will be more cautious about the rental company i choose .
neutral	regards ,
neutral	d . m . grant
neutral	refubrish part did not work .
neutral	good shipping respond and good communication .
neutral	paying for freight makes you high priced in the market with no offset .
neutral	i found what i was looking for and the transaction was quick and smoothed .
neutral	but i had questions about another purchase .
neutral	they initially replied requesting follow - up information .
neutral	i sent back the info and it was the last i '_ve heard from them .
neutral	i guess they are not interested in more business .
neutral	i also dislike the commercials after i buy something makes me feel as if i made a mistake by buying from you .
neutral	if you happen to change you mind on buying a part or make a mistake , you can '_t change it right_away . thats the only draw_back for me .
neutral	everything else was good !
neutral	as a tech for 00 years you get to the point where you think you have seen it all .
neutral	i knew that i was not going to be getting top of the line parts at the price i paid .
neutral	not like factory parts but workable .
neutral	we will see how things whole up ?
neutral	the last shipment was delayed because you first wanted me to confirm the name of my vet .
neutral	months_ago i sent you a copy of the prescription for the special_diet cat_food .
neutral	if you want the name of my pet '_s veterinarian , look at that prescription yourself .
neutral	don_'_t waste my time .
neutral	i received all but two of my parts as expected , except for two of them .
neutral	it has now been two_weeks , and all i can gather is they are working on tracking my parts , or working on a refund .
neutral	parts were in stock , according to the website , but it appears i will not be getting them .... other than the two parts , and dealing_with the hassle of receiving them , or a refund , i was pretty pleased .
neutral	i booked a class of vehicle that i was somewhat familiar with as i drive a matrix at home , a toyota auris , it was the car shown in the advertising material , when we arrived we asked about a gps unit , one was immediately produced and given to us at a charge of 000 bp for the hire period , first it only spoke german , so a trip back to the point of sale was required , pouring_rain and freezing_cold didn_'_t help .
neutral	after setting the hired gps unit up we were on our way , only to find later that the car was equipped with it '_s own built in unit , a total waste of money , which wouldnt have happened if the receptionist had taken the time to ask what car we had taken .
neutral	upon return the " extras " we were charged were almost triple the original_quote .
neutral	so if you use alamo be sure to get an explanation of what the final_bill will be !!
neutral	!
neutral	the car itself was a joy to drive and everyone we saw was impressed with it , as were we .
neutral	the flowers were wilting a bit and the lilies were brown on some edges -- below_average for the cost of the flowers .
neutral	however delivery was fast and on time .
neutral	they were stearing too much and commenting on peoples wives in a wanting matter . the pool were also closed ! maybe get an extra pool would be nice
neutral	i have used discount_supplements three_times , the first two times went without_any trouble .
neutral	today i have supposedly received my parcel @ 0 :_00am , i was in the house all day and nothing arrived , no knock at the door , no card posted , just an_email_stating : " delivered to secure location ".
neutral	as far as i am concerned the only secure location is my house , not in my garden , or next door , or anywhere_else .
neutral	both my neighbours are elderly and they have told me they have received nothing , i don_'_t know every person in my street so if it has_been delivered anywhere_else i wouldn_'_t know unless they informed me therefore parcels can easily be stolen .
neutral	to not receive a card to state where its been left is a disgrace , they did not knock and i am struggling to believe it even got delivered because my neighbours either side do not have the parcel .
neutral	hermes are truly incompetent and because discount_supplements use this embarrassing courier for their parcels i am afraid i will never order from discount_supplements again unless this changes .
neutral	i have contacted discount_supplements and they said they will contact the courier and email me and let_me know which i think is a terrible way to handle a customer complaint , so now i have got to wait for an_email instead of a call to see what has happened to my parcel that i have spent my hard_earned money on and also paid for next_day delivery which i have now not received .
neutral	really disappointing .
neutral	tried booking two groups for the same trip ...
neutral	the bookit agent first had trouble applying the coupon_codes then had trouble matching the same flights and dates for the second group .
neutral	had to cancel multiple bookings and try again .
neutral	finally succeeded in booking all together but still have some uncancelled bookings showing on my bookit account so i will have to call back to resolve .
neutral	the cancellations caused multiple large credit_card charges which take about a week to reverse so there wasn_'_t enough room on the card for the final booking .
neutral	the bookit agent split the total into multiple staggered payments for us so it would go through .
neutral	i '_m sure this is just some random technical difficulty which can sometimes happen since most other_reviewers are quite pleased .
neutral	all in all , i '_m happy to be booked and i '_m confident bookit will help sort out the extraneous bookings .
neutral	no comments because i don_'_t have a catch phrase .
neutral	no comment at this time
neutral	i have not received an explanation why i was charged 000 sek instead of 000_euro for delivery fee .
neutral	when i sent the question to sbg , i received a reply with several general rules that i could read before but it was not my case .
neutral	and delivery of one of the goods took 0_weeks to complete .
neutral	i have used ray - ban_sunglasses a few_times ( it `_s still winter in sweden ) and cover begins to break .
neutral	however , no_complaints of actual products !
neutral	sincerely , george gaharia
neutral	i got the part ( alternator ) however i contacted customer service via_email to obtain authorization to ship back the core and get an address to where i need to ship .
neutral	forty eight hours_later and still no response from customer service .
neutral	this in my optnion is a failure on their behalf with regard to customer service .
neutral	i have basically rebuilt an entire car with parts from partsgeek and all the parts have been exactly_what ive been looking for .
neutral	everything comes very fast to .
neutral	unless you have a core_return , get ready for the biggest lack of info ever on how to return a core .
neutral	i sent them an_email on my own , since no return information was generated .
neutral	then out of the 0 parts , they sent me one rma_number and told me the next one would be available in 0 - 0 days , which it was not .
neutral	and after a week i sent them an_email_asking where the rma_number is or even the address to send it to .
neutral	painful , after paying shipping , i may as well have just bought something from autozone so i could return the core instantly .
neutral	this particular order is mediocre at best .
neutral	initially , colors were horrible but within a week they have improved but certainly not great .
neutral	plan not to recommend to others .
neutral	don_'_t say that we had to put up a deposit .
neutral	the other company '_s like priceline and
neutral	hotwire never ask for a deposit
neutral	greatmats didn_'_t have the raw material in stock and it took two months to get them .
neutral	they did proactively communicate the issues with me .
neutral	i haven_'_t installed them yet .
neutral	we ordered 0 packs of brush_heads from molarclean after discovering them via a google_search for oral - b heads !
neutral	the order process was efficient and the heads arrived swiftly .
neutral	my wife and i both installed molarclean heads in our braun toothbrushes .
neutral	they fit fine and seemed to be working okay - although we did notice the missing brush fibres in the centre of the new heads - this has_been commented upon by others .
neutral	i noticed that the molarclean head was harder than the oral - b original and after a few_days my gums began to hurt .
neutral	i persevered for a couple more days , then decided that it didn_'_t want to risk damaging my gums .
neutral	i emailed molarclean , as per their website .
neutral	having not received a reply after two working days , i sent another email .
neutral	this time i received a reply : " if you are not happy with the molarclean toothbrush_heads you can return them to ..."
neutral	we returned the heads the next_day .
neutral	we waited a week .
neutral	no reply and no refund .
neutral	i emailed again and received an assurance that the matter would be followed_up .
neutral	it was and we have now received a refund for the 0 packs of brush_heads .
neutral	so , overall , not exactly_what we expected and not brilliant after - sales service .
neutral	i hope this is a balanced & helpful review .
neutral	booking_fee cost almost as much as the deposit
neutral	ordering was easy and product assortment great .
neutral	however i missed service mails with status on order , and the order status page didn_'_t work .
neutral	access to service personnel also a bit difficult and slow .
neutral	main_reason to buy again would be price competitiveness .
neutral	packaging - ok
neutral	delivery time - average
neutral	service - no_issues to report
neutral	the track at spa is fantastic and we had a beautiful day but i personally wouldn_'_t go again with this organiser in this format .
neutral	there were a lot of cars on track ranging_from ordinary road cars to race_cars with slick tyres .
neutral	this meant that you were constantly having to look in the rear mirror and move over to let others pass disrupting your concentration and causing you to leave your line .
neutral	also , despite the organiser '_s briefing , there was plenty of bullying by faster cars , overtaking on corners , on the right etc .
neutral	i dont think that the rules were properly enforced .
neutral	there were cars refuelling from jerry cans in the pit lane while others were smoking !
neutral	as an occasional track day goer , i want to have fun and i want to feel that safety is the organiser '_s principal concern .
neutral	i didnt really feel that on this occasion and i didnt enjoy myself as much as i have on other track days .
neutral	regarding my last order .
neutral	it was first placed on 00 / 00 / 00 for a flat_screen wall_bracket .
neutral	i received the order 00 / 00 / 00 but instead of a wall_bracket i got a cable assembly .
neutral	i called customer service they said they would get the correct part out to me .
neutral	i received the next delivery for my wall_bracket and this time it was a push_button switch .
neutral	so i called customer service they said they would take_care of it .
neutral	so i '_m wanting to see what i '_ll get this time .
neutral	i wanted to buy a blue trolley it was marked " in stock " in the shop .
neutral	however , after one week with no delivery i mailed and received the response that the trolley in blue is out of stock .
neutral	as i needed one very fast i decided to buy a black trolley which arrived a couple of days_later ....
neutral	the third time i '_ve used cjs and again i '_ve had problems ( although first order went through without issue ).
neutral	delay '_s in getting the games etc etc .
neutral	if the games have plenty of stock at the time of purchase , great , otherwise there seems to be a delay greater than what '_s on the site and support leaves a lot to be desired .
neutral	a classic case of over promising and under achieving for me , so i '_ll be getting my games elsewhere from now on .
neutral	not much to really say .
neutral	prices and products are the same as other_places .
neutral	well made product but the size indicators are wrong ......
neutral	i chose a large size however the better fit would have been the size smaller .
neutral	i wish i had read the reviews before ordering as it seems to be a consistent theme .
neutral	i received a nice clean , undamaged part . it was a good shipping time , and it went in nice and easy . the only problem i had was the sockets would not accept the wiring_harness plugs . i had to use the old_ones so they would hook back up .
neutral	i always get my sons fightwear from deepblue and got him some grappling socks for £_00 the other day , they already have holes in .
neutral	this is the first time i will have had to take anything back to the store , i '_ll update the review if service is cool .
neutral	delivery was a bit_slow and it wasnt until i phoned the company as an item was missing that they told me it was out of stock .
neutral	would of appreciated a call or e_-_mail at_least , just waiting on a refund on my card .
neutral	the woman at the counter in frankfurt , germany where we picked_up our rental_car was extremely rude .
neutral	she tried to force us into buying $ 0 , 000 more in auto insurance .
neutral	when we refused she very loudly announced to everyone_else in line that we were not insured .
neutral	after a sleepless overnight flight from the us this was the last thing we needed .
neutral	makes me wonder_if i '_ll ever do_business with avis again .
neutral	the price advertised was 00 . i had to pay 0 quid card charges which weren_'_t optional . deception of the highest order but still worked out a good price .
neutral	update_: thanks for your response .
neutral	the price advertised didn_'_t show the fees and therefore i stand by my comments . the price for comparison should include fees which are not optional .
neutral	travelocity changed me and my fiance flight from 00am to 00 . 00pm , we will arrive in
neutral	las_vegas at 0pm we will have to pick_up a rental_car , get checked in to the hotel , we had hoped to get to see a little_bit of las_vegas that first night but i guess not . i really
neutral	like booking on travelocity but all the flight changes makes me think about booking on
neutral	delta .
neutral	impossible to get a human on the phone .
neutral	you have to go through the web_interface , and that takes_forever for them to respond .
neutral	can '_t open multiple tickets for their multiple screw ups .
neutral	i ordered two outer tie_rods for the same vehicle , got two parts that are of different length , with the same model number .
neutral	ordered a ball bearing assempbley , took_forever to get it .
neutral	contacted them to inquire on where the part is , took_forever to get a response back .
neutral	my package was delayed , however , onnit hooked it up with their new immune supp .
neutral	( thank_you ) upon_receiving my package , there were ants inside the hemp_force bars box .
neutral	the box was sealed in tape all around .
neutral	there were no ants around the box at the door , so i was surprised to see them inside .
neutral	not sure how they got there .
neutral	however , none of the packs seemed to be compromised .
neutral	i received my im fitnesstreadmill , with its power incline controll , almost punctually from uk_sport .
neutral	it assembled easily as all major parts had already been assembled or pre_- fixed to their relative frames , except that the whole completely assembled treadmill was quite heavy , wieghing atleast 00kgs in weight !
neutral	so you have to pre_- decide which which corner / place you have to locate your treadmill to beacuse it would be quite hard to move it .
neutral	however , despite uk_sport had been showing good communications to me yet i felt that paying an extra 00 ukp for two - men '_s delivery was far too expensive !
neutral	as what the delivery men had to do in our case was pushing a " single " big box along in our lounge and that was it !!
neutral	most similar on - line companies have been offering " completely free delivery " these days , as such uk_sport should do that too rather_than charging its customers an " extra " for it , which was 00ukps to almost 00_% of my treadmill basic value .
neutral	my treadmill is performing o . k at the moment , but i still put off by this extra - 00 ukps delivery fee for my possible purchases !!!
neutral	!
neutral	part took_forever to come .
neutral	shipped by fedex who works with the usps to reduce costs .
neutral	package lost in reno , nv by the usps and finally found its way locally and sat at a random usps facility for two_days .
neutral	not a good experience at all !
neutral	i would have rather paid more for shipping then deal with this nonsense ..
neutral	i ordered a throttle cable for my truck on 0 / 00 .
neutral	i did not like the message that appeared when i ordered ( please be aware that it is not possible to change or cancel your order .
neutral	), but , it was a small part so finished the order .
neutral	since i only have a po_box , i usually include the number somewhere in my physical_address , like the + 00 part of the zip , or address line two , especially when the shipping method is not clearly_stated as ups or fedex .
neutral	then if it goes to the post_office , they are easily able to figure_out who it is for .
neutral	the zip_code only allowed five digits , so i put pob xxxx on address line 0 .
neutral	it looked fine , but when i received my ship confirmation the next_day , only the first address line was included .
neutral	so , when my post_office received it , they sent it out for delivery to a physical_address .
neutral	then they returned it to the post_office as undeliverable .
neutral	without a po number , it would likely have been sent back .
neutral	i am fortunate to have a small post_office , and someone knew me so they were able to get me connected with the package finally today .
neutral	usually they would put it in a lock box and leave me the key , but since it was shipped in a box too big to fit , i had to take off work early , drive 00_minutes to the post_office , and get to the counter just before they closed at 0 .
neutral	not convenient .
neutral	so , there are a number of things i would like to have seen done better :
neutral	0 .
neutral	the order “ cannot be canceled ” immediately upon ordering .
neutral	it appears all you could do is return it .
neutral	0 .
neutral	the shipping company is not clearly_stated .
neutral	0 .
neutral	address line two is not used when shipping .
neutral	like , for an apartment .
neutral	really ?
neutral	0 .
neutral	zipcode is limited to five characters .
neutral	0 .
neutral	a skinny 0 foot long throttle cable was packed inside a 000 cubic inch box , which was inside a 0000 cubic inch box which did not fit in a lock - box at the post_office so i had to pick it up in person .
neutral	not a problem though if it had been shipped via a private carrier .
neutral	0 .
neutral	the confirmation i received contained both a valid post_office number , and an invalid fed - ex number .
neutral	that seems sloppy .
neutral	0 .
neutral	$ 0 . 00 shipping is too much for a short cable that was mis_- sent .
neutral	i hope you will consider these comments for possible changes to your shipping policies .
neutral	thanks !
neutral	part was correct , but free shipping took 0 days
neutral	it was fast shipping , but the book was more damaged than_expected
neutral	the hotel_room was nice enough .
neutral	room was clean and semi modern .
neutral	for the cost i was expecting more though .
neutral	the shower_head was broken and looked to be about 00 years old .
neutral	ill try a different hotel next time i head to orlando .
neutral	when i placed the order i did not create an account now that my order is finally on the way i wanted to track the package so i tried to create an account with no luck because it says my e_-_mail is already in use well yea i gave it when i placed the order so after my effort i still don_'_t know where my package is .
neutral	ordered 0 pairs of pants , one fitted well , the other was not well fitted which was a shame .
neutral	it '_s very hard to fix any_problems that you have
neutral	just joined will let you know in 0 months .
neutral	os - x and ios devices now outsell all windows pcs combined .
neutral	identity_guard only offers services for windows computers .
neutral	makes me feel_like this service is about a decade behind .
neutral	ordered a pair of jeans and paid £_00 . 00 with free delivery but when the jeans turned_up they had a price tag of £_00 . 00 , i am writing to the company for a refund of the £_00 . 00
neutral	vírus protects seems ok but absence of alerts doesn_'_t mean good protection .
neutral	parental control reporting doesn_'_t work as_advertised and company is unresponsive to support requests
neutral	axle came in timely_manner but was missing the new roll pin needed for install .
neutral	had to use old one because i could not wait the week or so it would have taken to get a new one .
neutral	parts came poorly_packaged and had holes on box where , i '_m sure , the roll pin fell out .
neutral	c ' mon " geeks " use a little more tape when sending parts out .
neutral	product is great value , however , for one item delivery charge is very high ..
neutral	the delivery drivers could be more communicative and perhaps look a little happier !!
neutral	!
neutral	no issue with the product and previous deliveries have gone well , but this time not so good .
neutral	sp confirmed monday that the arranged delivery date of thursday was firm .
neutral	waited_until 0000 hrs on thursday then called sp .
neutral	they assurred me the delivery driver would be with me before 0000hrs .
neutral	no telephone_call from driver - no delivery - stayed in all evening .
neutral	delivery arrived at 0000 next_day without the advance telephone_call from driver .
neutral	all i needed was a call saying what was happening !!
neutral	!
neutral	ordered seeds on the 00th .
neutral	today is the 00th .
neutral	probably stopped by customs in lax enroute to colorado .
neutral	i hope not .
neutral	got the stealth shipping for souvenir seeds .
neutral	site is informative and checkout was easy .
neutral	emailed confirmation and communication was quick .
neutral	car provided had body damage on driver '_s side .
neutral	there was no problem with identification of damage prior to driving away but condtoi of the car could have been better .
neutral	took 0 days to get , others 0 or less .
neutral	no one mentioned before moving in time that the monthly rate would double after six_months and there would be an added $ 0 mandatory_insurance fee .
neutral	the discount offers are the worst i have ever try to used - and at check out the free shiping thing make me think my card info is not safe the way it take you out of check out .
neutral	i like the service and from time to time will try to order from you .
neutral	i would buy from partsgeek again .
neutral	great prices and once i was able to reach customer service by phone , the parts were shipped a little sooner_than i expected .
neutral	the reason i give only 0_stars is i wanted to confirm that i was ordering the correct parts for my year and model vehicle .
neutral	i waited almost 00_minutes on hold until the call was answered .
neutral	the representative was fantastic and even created an order number that was emailed to me .
neutral	i only had to click on the link in the email and the complete order as discussed was already created .
neutral	from there i only had to continue to the checkout screen .
neutral	another issue concerning the availability of customer service is that they do not appear work on weekends so it delayed the order by 0 days until they responded on monday .
neutral	i find it annoying that every time i log in to identity_guard , a pop - up window blocks everything asking me to upgrade .
neutral	the waiting time on line takes_forever .
neutral	- difficult to reach for questions by mail ,
neutral	- and only the english_language : can not be written in dutch
neutral	- and if i canceled a hostel , i can not see it in my bank_account from which money was refunded the hostel !
neutral	two issues : no paypal option for new accounts , and dlgamer '_s file downloader is the slowest i '_ve ever used -- it took over fourteen hours to download a 0gb package , but that could have something to do with the fact that dlg seems to be located in france while i '_m in the us .
neutral	other than that , the experience was pretty standard for a digital retail service .
neutral	i appreciated the promptness of service and delivery of the ink but the packages were messy leaving ink on my hands .
neutral	also i was unable to get_rid of the lines caused_by misalignment after they were installed despite taking the remedial measures to fix it .
neutral	i have had to buy genuine canon to overcome the problem .
neutral	i will not order your products again unless you improve the quality .
neutral	john
neutral	i agree with your policy on returning parts , but your response time and contact by phone is terrable .
neutral	website looks nice but confusion over initial meeting .
neutral	still feeling my way .
neutral	everything i ordered was delivered present & correct but delivered late .
neutral	i deliberately made my order in excess of £_000 as to get the next_day delivery .
neutral	ordered on a thursday and received an e_-_mail late thursday_night saying they could not get my order out in time therefore it would be delivered asap which was on the monday .
neutral	an_apology but no other explanation .
neutral	i am sure the products will surpass the delivery .
neutral	ordered a data cab .
neutral	only a cheap 0 u unit but when we received it although the packaging was intact the cab looked like it had been dropped several_times .
neutral	the shelf which was packaged seperatly was also damaged .
neutral	but due to the time_constraints on the job we didn_'_t have the time available to get the unit replaced , so with a little hammering and repositioning most of the damage is hidden .
neutral	will use again but maybe try ordering a little earlier in case the same happens again .
neutral	das die adresse als rechnungsadresse gemeint war , ist mir erst klar geworden als die bestätigung gekommen ist , also ärgerlich da_ich dies dann vor ort korrigieren lassen muss .
neutral	den wechsel zwischen den hotels habe_ich als etwas umständlich empfunden , aber ich_war jetzt auch zum erstmal auf ihrer seite .
neutral	if the product works , why try and change it and piss people off from using it .
neutral	just leave it alone .
neutral	it '_s cool that travelocity will save dates from previous searches with cookies or whatever they use , but i think at some point during my order , after i chose dates final dates , a cached page must have loaded .
neutral	when i clicked submit , the dates of my hotel reservation were from a previous search instead of my most_recent search .
neutral	because it was correct on the first page of my order , i didn_'_t think to check the confirmation page as carefully as i apparently needed to .
neutral	i wound_up having to call the hotel to change my reservation , which defeats the purpose of using travelocity to begin with .
neutral	your product prices are very good , though i never add free items to my order because the shipping increases with every item added .
neutral	this used to be my go to place for shopping when it comes to motorcycle accessories .
neutral	lately service has_been going down_hill .
neutral	i will call and order a part , being assured it '_s in stock and ready to ship , yet it won_'_t ship for days .
neutral	sometimes over a week .
neutral	when the shipping is delayed i receive no notifications from you .
neutral	i have to call and ask what is going on .
neutral	like the video reviews .
neutral	like the prices .
neutral	like that you cater to track day riders .
neutral	i like the product and it will be very helpfull if i can just figure_out how to use it and it will save me a lot of money once i can get it figured_out .
neutral	i wish that a instructional manual would have been with the product .
neutral	see_above !
neutral	i would not book bigbustours once again !
neutral	i got on here hoping to find out about my credit .
neutral	it worked good .
neutral	i got all my credit_scores , and that was fine .
neutral	i have paid off all my credit_cards , and was hoping to see a big change in scores after a month .
neutral	well , i '_ve been on this site now for over a month , and there have been no changes ?
neutral	i thought they would update everything at_least every month ??
neutral	evidently not .
neutral	also , you can check with other credit sites , and none have the same scores , even having the same info .
neutral	think ill just stick to the big 0 ...
neutral	i purchase regularly from giftcards . com .
neutral	however when i attempted to purchased cards outside of normal scope of purchase , i was declined check out and was not able to buy them .
neutral	it was very disheartening and disappointing .
neutral	received lint filter quickly but had just been placed in simple jiffy_bag without_any further bubble_wrap and was damaged in the post .
neutral	a follow_up confirmation_email would have been helpful
neutral	wordpress is a good platform to work with , professional looking and good statistics .
neutral	ordered these for my wife , flowers when they arrived we great and she was delighted .
neutral	however on the web_site it asks for any special request on delivery .
neutral	i filled this out on the order and had asked for driver to call me prior to delivery but they were completely_ignored .
neutral	kind of ruined the moment .
neutral	my advice - don_'_t give the option if you are not going to look at it .
neutral	several days after ordering , i received and email_notifying my that my purchase had been flagged as potential fraud .
neutral	i suspect that this is because the shipping address was different than the billing_address for my card .
neutral	the email said either to call or respond to the email with confirmation that i ordered these shirts .
neutral	i elected to email , rather_than call .
neutral	the next_day i got another email_telling_me that i ' d just have to call anyway .
neutral	hmmpf .
neutral	spent 00_minutes on hold , then my call was dropped .
neutral	after another 00_minutes , i was able to confirm my order .
neutral	after that , the shirts arrived without_incident .
neutral	printing looks great and had no_problems with shipping .
neutral	none of this would have happened if they supported paying with paypal .
neutral	they lose 0_stars for not having that common_sense .
neutral	trip_advisor is a good reference , but often has over rated hotel locations .
neutral	no customer service if you have any questions .
neutral	all my e_-_mails went_unanswered .
neutral	decent parts for the price .
neutral	avevo prenotato una jeep gran cherokee ( o similare ), ma al_momento del ritiro l ' agenzia mi_ha informato che_non_è più disponibile , quindi sono_stato costretto a prendere una kia sorento ( o in alternativa una hyundai santa_fe ).
neutral	comunque auto accettabile anche_se , personalmente , al di sotto dello standard richiesto .
neutral	ebay is great for buying and selling as there both made very easy and simple .
neutral	ebay uses paypal alot , so this makes transactions secure and safe
neutral	i buy from ebay daily as its a plesure with no adds or popups
neutral	ive rated it 0stars as the users of the site are somtimes .. not as trustworthy as you may think
neutral	i have been scammed and so have many other people i know
neutral	but its hard to please everyone
neutral	parts that i have ordered have been great unit the most_recent part .
neutral	if the last part and the associated customer_support were my sole expierience with this company i would have given them 0_star .
neutral	the most_recent part was a window_motor . that quickly arrived so i tore the door apart to install it only to find it was for the opposite door .
neutral	i looked at my online order confirmation and the part number on the box which confirmed the part was ordered and per the box the correct rh part was shipped but the part in the box was incorrect and for the lh side .
neutral	i don_'_t blame parts_geek for passing the wrong part through to me from their supplier what i do blame them for is their online customer_support .
neutral	i filled the template out with all the details and my first response back was a few_days and then they ased me for the part number and information that i had already included in the template .
neutral	we went back and forth several_times to no_avail .
neutral	my advise to parts_geek is to improve your customer_support .
neutral	i finally scrounged a phone_number for sales and the gentleman i spke to wa able to help me out .
neutral	had it not been for him this would have been my final purchase from parts_geek .
neutral	i ordered a steel gas_tank for my 0000_dodge_neon which arrived in a short_period of time .
neutral	upon dismantling the vent check valve and the filler tube that is held into the tank with a grommet , the grommet got damaged .
neutral	i went back to partsgeek and they could not help me with this part .
neutral	i went to auto advance and once again , no luck .
neutral	when i went to the dodge dealer , i was told that the part no_longer was made .
neutral	have tried everywhere to obtain this part but to no_avail .
neutral	would have liked to have known this before purchasing the fuel_tank .
neutral	on the other hand , maybe they did not know .
neutral	so i am left to prefab some sort of leak proof seal before i install the tank .
neutral	found the part i needed for a 0000 000 bmw but was unable to correct my mistake before shipment in ordering part for the right side rather_than the left_side i needed .
neutral	therefore , had to return wrong part after receipt even_though would have been easier for both_sides to correct error before shipment .
neutral	also online site to obtain a rma_# for the return did not work so had long wait to talk to customer sevice .
neutral	delivery . com sends out a lot of $ 0 and $ 0 coupons which are great .
neutral	they don_'_t just give you a code to type in though .
neutral	you have to click a link in the email they sent .
neutral	there '_s no simple way of applying the coupon after you '_ve picked out all the stuff you want to order .
neutral	you have to start over .
neutral	but for $ 0 , i '_ll live with that quirk .
neutral	they have a good selection of restaurants .
neutral	the menus are generally up - to - date , but generally don_'_t include specials ( soup of the day , etc_.).
neutral	if i have to call the restaurant to find that out , i '_m just going to skip delivery . com altogether and order on the phone .
neutral	the actual delivery of what you ordered and how long it takes is hit - or - miss .
neutral	sometimes items are missing , sometimes it takes 00_minutes to deliver a pizza on a tuesday_night , but i guess that phenomenon existed before delivery . com did .
neutral	so , they haven_'_t really done anything to fix that problem .
neutral	the rundown between delivery . com and the restaurant when this happens reminds_me of sam lowry in the movie " brazil " trying to get a government document both signed and stamped .
neutral	you can save your favorite orders to save time on future orders .
neutral	i '_ve used that feature once or twice .
neutral	usually , the order is different every time .
neutral	delivery . com has no understanding of how to deal with tipping .
neutral	you have to either put some amount on the tip line and hope the delivery person delivers the kind of service deserving of the tip or just put down $ 0 and have cash on hand for decent service .
neutral	this model is broken and demonstrates that delivery . com does not understand what tips are for .
neutral	if the order is late or incomplete , you just gave some dude 00_% so you can feel_like a chump .
neutral	if it '_s still hot and on time , i '_ve got cash .
neutral	if not , here '_s a " tip ": stop sucking .
neutral	delivery . com offers points for stuff .
neutral	i '_ve never redeemed them and don_'_t know how many i have .
neutral	probably a lot .
neutral	you can apply the points to get discounts on future orders .
neutral	i '_m sure i '_ll do that some day .
neutral	overall , it '_s a good service but not so good that i don_'_t just call the restaurant directly more than half the time .
neutral	if you like all the points and gimcrackery that comes with ordering your lo mein and wonton soup , you '_ll be pleased with delivery . com in much the same way you ' re pleased with seamless or grubhub or whatever .
neutral	looks_like this company has some great selection !
neutral	global_parking is good , the idea / concept is great .
neutral	the problem i have found is the parking locations .
neutral	i have used global for several_years and was extremely_satisfied , until the passed few uses .
neutral	i have always parked at silver sevens in las_vegas and the service was good .
neutral	they change their shuttle pick_up and delivery schedule and it '_s not posted .
neutral	the desk clerks don_'_t want anything to do with parking customers .... " it '_s not their problem ".
neutral	i waited over an_hour for pick_up last time , because the had already made a trip to the airport and had other things to do
neutral	i '_m trying global one more time , using a different parking location .
neutral	if there is problems , it will be may last time .
neutral	saving a few dollars isn_'_t worth a lot of hassle .
neutral	global_parking website works well and is easy to use .
neutral	thank_you , jim
neutral	why should i rate now when the only_thing that has happened as yet is that you ( b_&_h ) has my money .
neutral	why don_'_t you ask for a review after the item has_been delivered so that i can complain_about things like the process where you say it is free and it is being delivered via_fedex to the freaking post_office so then i can watch it sit there for 0 - 0 days before it actually gets delivered .
neutral	price less_than one p per_litre than direct quote and delivery time longer so a fine balance .
neutral	parts are 0 / 0 rd cheaper from gainsbrough direct
neutral	while it '_s convenient to have my orders delivered , it took way too_long for them to reach my house .
neutral	part of the advantage of ordering online includes not having to go to the store for my products .
neutral	it defeats the purpose if i end up having to do that anyway , just because my orders hadn_'_t yet arrived .
neutral	i would hate to think this is connected in any way to their over - zealous push to persuade people of setting_up automated deliveries .
neutral	if it continues , i '_ll just have to drive my lazy self to the pet_store .
neutral	got the part just yesterday which was to late to hv it installed the shipping was an issue it was suppose to be here on wednesday .
neutral	and it arrrived on sat
neutral	the part i ordered was out of stock , order canceled and money promptly refunded .
neutral	the item is still listed as available on the website .
neutral	somebody needs to fix the listing .......
neutral	the customer service was eager and friendly but in the eagerness .
neutral	the rep missed important details such as registering me at the correct facility .
neutral	i like the controller , but the d pad sticks , right out of the box ?
neutral	i '_m a little upset .
neutral	when i called , you treated it like it was a warranty issue instead of a u sent me a broke controller issue .
neutral	usually very happy with this site , always good service with fast delivery .
neutral	but on this occasion was promised free_gift which didn_'_t arrive with my order ?
neutral	!
neutral	sadly , when i got my confirmation from viator it said my tour of venice would be fulfilled by dark rome .
neutral	that '_s not a problem , but just for fun i went to the dark rome site and looked at prices - found the exact_same tour for less ( not much , 0 euros , but still ).
neutral	now i '_m in the middle of their " price guarantee " refund process - wish i didn_'_t have to go through this but i '_ll stick it through .
neutral	so_far its been 0 days and no response from viator - that in and of itself is unacceptable ( for a price guarantee !
neutral	).
neutral	no problem with navigation , checkout and receipt of order , pleased
neutral	i am having_trouble with a type hp00 color_cartridge which i purchased awhile back .
neutral	some of the colors aren_'_t there at all and others are the wrong shade .
neutral	for instance the red comes out a lilac color .
neutral	i have also purchased hp000 cartridges which work out okay , but the type 00 cartridge is worthless .
neutral	a type 00 cartridge which i purchased with the type 00 cartridge does not work well in the fast print mode ( comes out too light ) but is usable in the normal print mode .
neutral	i am using a hp 000cxi printer which worked_fine with previous cartridges .
neutral	i had problems with ink_cartridge not working , but then i rubbed it with a cloth and it worked later .
neutral	i need to see how other two perform before i say that i like or don_'_t lie your quality
neutral	although i like target , i do not shop on their website often .
neutral	it is a very difficult site to navigate and find the item you are seeking .
neutral	the filter tools are not efficient , thereby making it difficult to narrow_down a search .
neutral	you would think a corporation like target would have the resources to build an exemplary website that is user_friendly and easy to navigate .
neutral	i do return from time to time to see if it has improved , but not so much .
neutral	come target , we expect better .
neutral	apart_from the wardrobes all was ok . one of the hinges is faulty , but not bad enough to return .
neutral	for the money i spent not 000_% happy .
neutral	you want me to write a review about your service , well first were is my ( strut_mount ) that i order a week a go for my bmw , i am upset right now .
neutral	free shipping isn_'_t such a good deal when there ' sa $ 00handling charge .
neutral	i downloaded their mobile_app and was told upon_arrival just open it up and request my car to be brought to the terminal .
neutral	well after waiting for over a 0 / 0 hour and numerous_times trying , i called and they said they never got my request !!!!!
neutral	whats the point if it doesn_'_t work !!!!
neutral	!
neutral	with the special coupon_code the price was better_than i could get at the pet superstores .
neutral	delivery came in only two_days .
neutral	however , every time i order two thirty pound_bags , the box they package it in falls apart when i go to pick it up after it is delivered .
neutral	the tape holding the box together falls apart and the cardboard the box is made out of is to thin for the sixty pounds that the dog_food weighs .
neutral	if the box did not fall_apart i would have rated four starts instead of three .
neutral	i ordered a bentley service manual for my bmw , and it arrived , shrink_wrapped with unacceptable manufacturing defects .
neutral	a chunk of the first 00 pages was missing , and the pages were glued together .
neutral	i emailed partsgeek last_week .
neutral	i received an_automated_response that someone would be contacting me for an_rma , but so_far , nothing .
neutral	well , i am still_waiting , but i will email them again .
neutral	order received yesterday minus the expensive pool_filter .
neutral	tried to track order but kept getting error_message that the email account and password .
neutral	at this point , i '_m not a happy customer ......
neutral	got told this was wrong that was wrong cover was scratched so payed less_than first said .
neutral	very easy to use site but was slightly disappointed by the despatch speed of the goods .
neutral	great packaging once it all arrived - overall a good service - thanks .
neutral	your parts are decently_priced .
neutral	i just wish you guys shipped to apo or fpo addresses .
neutral	while i understand a business not wanting to deal with us small time customers who do not make major purchases , a $_00 minimum is high , especially_considering that an exorbitant shipping charge will be added .
neutral	my ~$ 00 order cost $_00 + shipping .
neutral	total order for a $_00 order was more than $_00 .
neutral	it does not make me in a hurry to place another order .
neutral	i have rented from europe car on many occasions and rarely receive the car advertised .
neutral	most recently only small vans available when i expected a sedan similar to a passat ...... may start going elsewhere .
neutral	my first order was delivered in a week , which i think was reasonable , although no tracking_information was available until the day it arrived .
neutral	my second order , however , was placed on 00 / 00 .
neutral	today is 00 / 0 and the status says " in process ."
neutral	i called customer service .
neutral	it can be a little annoying when you call within 0 minutes of the call_center opening and get a message that says , " due to unusually high call_volumes , we cannot take your call at this time ."
neutral	really ?
neutral	are you ticking off that many customers that your call_center is overwhelmed ?
neutral	after about six attempts ( i got all the time in the world during a long commute ) i finally reached a live operator .
neutral	the service rep was courteous and tried to be helpful .
neutral	she could not find the cause of the delay , and promised to call back when she had more information .
neutral	that was 0 hours ago .
neutral	i suspect she has not gotten any more information ( i am assuming she means to keep her commitment .)
neutral	i tried_calling again , but once again got the " we don_'_t have enough operators / phone lines to handle our business volumes or we don_'_t care enough about customer service to pick_up our phones " message .
neutral	uncharitable ?
neutral	maybe , but this is not my idea of great customer service .
neutral	i want to like this company , and if they resolve this issue to my satisfaction ( meaning just communicate with me and fill my order in a reasonable time ) i will be happy to come_back here and amend my comments .
neutral	so having finally received an_email_informing_me one of my items was back - ordered , they are shipping my order today .
neutral	they dropped the ball on notifying_me of the shortage , which can happen to anyone , but the practice of giving themselves up to four business days to let you know if everything you order is in stock is not the best .
neutral	most sites i buy from tell you immediately if an item is out of stock .
neutral	the least they can do is notify you right_away and ask if you want a back - order or substitute .
neutral	placing the order was painless .
neutral	however the only communication was when i rang the company about the order and to ask for delivery date .
neutral	even when i ask on the order to be notified of a delivery date i was only send an_email when the driver was at my door !
neutral	i rung the carrier and arrange a new delivery , when the driver was on his way he rung to confirm .
neutral	however when i told_him my wife was in and would sign for the delivery he complained that he need help as he was by himself and the goods would need to be " hand balled " off the van as he had no tail - lift .
neutral	i will order from trading_depot again as the items are reasonably_priced but would like to be able to track my order on line and get emails at key stages of the order '_s progress .
neutral	this particular storage location is not the newest bird in the fleet , and much of the facility looks a bit like a flea market , with dilapidated facilities freshened up with paint .
neutral	the staff is nice enough , but could use some training in customer service .
neutral	much of the facility is in need of more than just spot repair , which based on the wall patches , bend fence lines and doors , and lack of attention to the lighting and fire system is going to be a serious project .
neutral	overall , i think a so - so rating is about right , and the low_prices reflect this pinto - like facility .
neutral	had to all up for replacement bolts for the wooden sides , and i have since noticed big ripples and chips in the red wagon base , is this to be expected .
neutral	for the cheap price ?
neutral	maybe !
neutral	!
neutral	item on the website stated it was made specifically for my vehicle .
neutral	however , it was too big
neutral	i had some issues ordering on - line .
neutral	i would go through everything , including paypal , then on the final step it would just freeze .
neutral	after two attempts , i called and was told there was not record of my order and to try again because he was too_busy to do it by phone .
neutral	i tried again , still didn_'_t work .
neutral	i then called back and spoke to the same gentleman_who then took my order as he had no record of it .
neutral	i needed this gasket and for a piece of rubber , it '_s priced pretty high .
neutral	probablly not dyer '_s fault as this was the cheapest one i could find .
neutral	i guess because it '_s an rv part , they can tack on an_additional 00 . 00 .
neutral	dyers did a good job shipping as i had the part in a couple of days .
neutral	not complete instructions included in the box , and a couple of the stool seats were scratched .
neutral	jim
neutral	i placed a order on may 00 & it took 0 days to get here from ohio , i have never had to wait that long for anything i ordered in the passed , i think someone made a hiccup some where , plus what i ordered was not what is listed as it to be , oh well can '_t win them all .. what '_s with the velcro on the brief tops , that stuff is pure junk after one hot summer .
neutral	the top was listed as having looped straps , but no it had junky velcro , i mean come on all the other tie downs were loop straps , why not on the sides to , the dang things stretch in the wind & the top flops & pops , it to was also stated that the top would not flop in the wind .
neutral	the extended tops flap worse then the short tops do .
neutral	the back part jumps around like a flag in a 000mph wind storm .
neutral	i can handle the top flopping around some , but i think for the cost they could ditch the velcro garbage .
neutral	just my 0 cents
neutral	thanks
neutral	i went on line to other co , s , ur parts were higher_priced 00 . 00 more . i did not check the other co , s un tell . i order ur parts first . and + their shipping was free .
neutral	really disappointed in them selling things that aren_'_t in stock and you don_'_t find out about it for 0 - 0 days_later .
neutral	if it were out of stock it should be posted that way before you order
neutral	still_waiting
neutral	still_waiting for an answer regarding the damaged component !
neutral	i ended_up having to pay for 0 parts - the correct one and the wrong one .
neutral	i will not purchase parts online again from eeuroparts .
neutral	i would only do phone orders .
neutral	i still think i should have a refund on the incorrect part .
neutral	we have used my protein products for a while now , specifically the impact_whey which is good quality and mixes as well as the more_expensive products on the market .
neutral	products are reasonably_priced and the internet site is easy to use .
neutral	unfortunately on this occasion we have had an issue with delivery , in fact we a still_waiting for our order to arrive even although the delivery agent has stated that the package was delivered yesterday .
neutral	my protein customer_services have been helpful so_far in trying to resolve this but as yet with no success .
neutral	i don_'_t believe that this is the fault of my protein specifically but the delivery courier but never the less it is still a pain having to chase the order .
neutral	it should be said that this is the first time that i have had an issue with any aspect of the process with my protein despite a number of orders over the last_year whereas i did have issues with a number of other similar companies in the past so assuming the delivery does arrive at some point i won_'_t be complaining too much !
neutral	the flowers were left in the open space in the corridor , without receiving any notification , and the box had been subsequently opened .
neutral	although the service and price were good , i am not real happy about the color_cartridge i received .
neutral	it was not dell as the picture showed , it s a knockoff and the printing is very streaky .
neutral	i probably will not buy again from inkfarm
neutral	i paid for overnight shipping and didn_'_t receive it till three_days_later
neutral	the service was very speedy on delivering the part however it was the wrong part and the hassle im getting just to return the part is ridiculous i gave the confirmation # and then you ask me to take pictures of the box and part then you want me to forward you accopy of the original email
neutral	i '_ve had one bad incident but thought i ' d give you a chance making_sure that i had given all the proper information so there were no mistakes .
neutral	because i know your customer service is not the best .
neutral	in fact it stinks .
neutral	but you came through this time .
neutral	goldstar service charges too much ; much too expensive per ticket charge by goldstar , and frequently theatre seats that are available are less_than optimal .
neutral	love your prices , site , etc .
neutral	but zero minus on any live customer_support .
neutral	every phone_number you have , never calls you back and only suggest you type up the problem ...
neutral	this is in reference to your procedures and my buying / ordering experience only .
neutral	there '_s no question about the product i bought from you , for i '_m completely_satisfied for the outcome .
neutral	have i known that the cost of sending you the core was on me , i shouldn_'_t have ordered it from you .
neutral	it was just the same if i bought it locally at auto_parts , in a shorter time .
neutral	i purchased two parts for the lower engine_cover for a 0000 jetta_tdi .
neutral	the parts i purchased are inferior to oem .
neutral	holes are not punched out for where fasteners are to be placed .
neutral	the alignment is not correct to match the parts up .
neutral	the add said 00 day trial and then 00 . 00 per_month .
neutral	your giving me 0_weeks and then 00 . 00 -
neutral	not happy
neutral	i referred a friend and the link in the email did not work .
neutral	tech_support didn_'_t get the issue fixed and the person i referred did not receive the three month trial as_promised when she signed_up .
neutral	the service you provide , as far as i can tell , is no better or worse than any other service i have tried , only more convoluted .
neutral	i dislike your homepage which only looks_like an advertisement with a member login button .
neutral	i '_ll give this service a couple of months , but i '_ve already given it its first test and it failed ... not very impressed .
neutral	i sent dvds , games , and old cds into musicmagpie and had been told there would be a " 0 working day " turnaround , however it took 00 working days to actually see the money , and i also saw on my sent list that i had apparantly put the wrong game into a ds game box ( cod_: modern_warfare ) which instantly took £ 0 off my money , but you haven_'_t sent it back to me , instead you '_ve kept whatever it is and i just lose out ... all in all , an ok experience .
neutral	shipping_costs were way too high .
neutral	found out after order that certain parts were out of stock .
neutral	also did not get a partial_refund on shipping for item that was never even sent .
neutral	parts arrived fine ... not happy with out of stock item and excessive shipping on air_filters .
neutral	i order two things one was correct the other did not match the car at all and the was no invoice on the box nor a return paper if needed i en it up with a part that i don_'_t need !!
neutral	i have to by the part somewhere_else again !
neutral	!
neutral	i thought goldstar is a great alternative to ticketmaster , and still offers reduced tickets .
neutral	however your fees are unreasonable and you are slowly becoming just like ticketmaster and , if you are not careful , will price yourselves out of existence with all of your fees .
neutral	$ 0 . 00 tacked on to each ticket for doing nothing is offensive .
neutral	as a client who puts tickets up on goldstar we have had to raise our tickets prices to the customer just to cover your $ 0 : 00 increase in fees .
neutral	you will fins less smaller theatres using your services if they cannot make a profit on the shows they produce and put allot of work into .
neutral	i am sure you have heard this complaint before and am even more sure that you will not do anythng to correct it so please do not send me any more of these surveys as they are a waste of my time .
neutral	the person with whom i spoke on the phone was very helpful and spent a considerable_amount of time trying to determine if the part i saw on the website was the correct part for my car .
neutral	he told me he thought it was but that it could be returned if not .
neutral	i placed the order : two_days_later , i received an e_-_mail indicating that , although the part was shown as being " in stock ", it was not .
neutral	it was on back order from the manufacturer / distributor .
neutral	i asked to be placed on a list to be alerted when the part was re - stocked and was told that dave '_s does not have such a feature available .
neutral	i then asked to be called instead and was told that dave '_s does not do that either , that i would have to continue to check back with them after " a week or so ".
neutral	great product , accurate_description .
neutral	shipping a little_slow for my taste .
neutral	i will use again , just not on a vehicle in need parts for quickly .
neutral	( did not pay for expedited_shipping because the total_cost would have been above my opinion of acceptable .)
neutral	tire_crazy has great prices and sometimes free shipping but their shipping process takes way too_long !
neutral	glasses were very good and customer service was excellent .
neutral	shipping of the glasses was a bit_slow .
neutral	hd is a good site !
neutral	i will_continue to buy there .
neutral	the team is working for improve shipping , dhl is really better_than air mail .
neutral	but the price to send is too expensive .
neutral	( brazil )
neutral	good , except for insistence on completing follow_up customer survey .
neutral	shipping was great , but finding some support phone numbers was incorrect or out of service on some parts of the website .
neutral	it would be better if you offer monthly credit_report
neutral	and score updates
neutral	i have been a loyal_customer of auto_europe , even_though it always happens that when i arrive in germany from the usa , i am never given the upgrade - car that i was promised in writing by auto_europe in the usa at the time of making my booking .
neutral	the same occurred this time when i booked the car with auto_europe in the usa and had their rental_car for the entire period of 00 days i spent in germany till june 00 .
neutral	on arrival in germany i was once again not given the vw_passat that i was promised in writing by auto_europe in the usa at the time i made the reservation .
neutral	instead i was given a skoda - most unsatisfactory !
neutral	!
neutral	the employees in the auto_europe reservations department in the usa are generally friendly and cooperative ; but when i land in germany i do not get the car i was promised ( in writing ).
neutral	order was slow in delivery and dispute over whether some items had been dispatched and delivered .
neutral	was resolved but communication poor and no feedback on progress
neutral	all goods delivered and refund sent on one item returned and new part delivered for a faulty component so order eventually completed to my satisfaction .
neutral	i have constructive_criticism .
neutral	i placed my order and was willing to pay for next_day shipping so i could give it as a christmas_gift .
neutral	i chose the correct option for this and confirmed my order .
neutral	it rejected my order because my zip_code was wrong .
neutral	i fixed this and confirmed again .
neutral	when the order was complete i saw that when i fixed the zip_code it had reset the postage to standard without letting_me know and there was no way to go back and change it .
neutral	this made the present be late .
neutral	--- the next problem is that i used a cupon that popped_up on the screen advertising 00_percent off and a free jump drive if i ordered then .
neutral	i received the discount but never received the jump drive .
neutral	other than these minor things , i was pleased with my order .
neutral	product was correct and worked well .
neutral	happy with the quality of merchandise when i can get it .
neutral	when in stock shipments are prompt and arrive in good shape .
neutral	pleased with products but frustrated as cannot order everything i want due to out of stock prompts .
neutral	the price they quoted seemed too good to be true when compared to competitors and it turns_out it was .
neutral	the competitors included all the relevant city / station taxes and auto_europe didn_'_t .
neutral	in the end , it didn_'_t cost me any more than it would have to go with someone_else , it just wasn_'_t the deal that was advertised .
neutral	as far as the car itself and the locations , everything was fine .
neutral	this company offers a great selection .
neutral	their prices are among the best .
neutral	however , be prepared to negotiate a pretty clumsy web_site .
neutral	they almost lost my business because it was so difficult
neutral	an easy selection and order process marred slightly by long construction / delivery time and the fact that my order was incomplete when it got here .
neutral	i have not yet replied to dino_pc after they sent me the remaining component to fit into the computer myself , but they forgot to include a bolt so that the wireless internet card could be secured into the tower properly ( they mentioned that they would ship one with the card in an e_-_mail ).
neutral	to me it seems as though my experience was a one in a blue moon but i still can '_t help but feel somewhat unsatisfied with this overall experience ; having said that though , i would not be perturbed from ordering from here again .
neutral	staff is helpful but the unit needs repairs .
neutral	ill keep you posted
neutral	in general the service has_been okay .
neutral	the place is clean and people managing the facility are polite and available when i need them .
neutral	i do have an issue .
neutral	i selected the storage because of the on - line price .
neutral	after only a couple of months the price was increased .
neutral	i am disappointed .
neutral	fab but to small for me and had to send back regards_david morgan .
neutral	my headlight look fantastic but you sent the wrong blinker .
neutral	i sent an_email .
neutral	got a reply saying u would b in touch w_/ me monday , yet no one did .
neutral	...
neutral	this site has a lot of choices but not enough information on each place .
neutral	it also had false_information about the place i rented out .
neutral	even thought i chose a storage place that had a great price , when i get there to rent the place , there was a mandatory_insurance i had to get , that bought the price up .
neutral	they also didn_'_t have 00 hour access which i was told they did , so i can load at night and beat the heat .
neutral	i requested to be notified when the shower spout was available and was not .
neutral	luckily i went back to the site and saw it .
neutral	i could not speak to anyone , opened up a ticket with a question that was never responded to but took the chance the part was correct .
neutral	it was , like new and delivered quickly .
neutral	if this company could offer customer service as they do with orders wow !!!!
neutral	!
neutral	waited for ages for an order !
neutral	my initial review was pretty bad and then out of the blue i got an_email to say there had been a problem with the manufacturing side of things .
neutral	they were very apologetic and promised delivery by a certain date - which was met .
neutral	they also included some freebies aswell !
neutral	in conclusion i would use them again , but their initial communications over delays needs a little improvement !
neutral	everything was ok
neutral	i trully expected to receive rose bushes that were larger than what was sent to me .
neutral	all 0 bushes put_together looked like 0 , normally i don_'_t complain , but for $_00 . 00 a piece for a bare root plant ?
neutral	i didn_'_t expect a huge rose bush , what i thought i was buying didn_'_t arrive though .
neutral	ordered this fuel accumulator due to the price --- best price i saw on - line and i jumped on it .
neutral	after i paid the $-- then i did the on - line search to see the parts_geek reputation ( i know -- too_late )
neutral	i got concerned seeing all the negative chatter .
neutral	so , for 0 days as i waited for ups , i wondered_if i ' d lost my money .....
neutral	no reason to worry ---- i got exactly_what i ordered , an original volvo part -- with good tracking communication -- delivered when promised .
neutral	total relief !!!!!!!!
neutral	they did good !
neutral	the negative chatter appears to be mostly around orders for specific parts that are not interchangeable -- maybe they suffered from inexperienced or pissed_off employees ?
neutral	my fuel accumulator fits cars over a 0 year stretch .
neutral	maybe that '_s why i had no problem ?
neutral	don_'_t know they got the right one in the box -- but i was concerned until i got the package in my hands .
neutral	it wasn_'_t packed too well --- a small box inside of a larger one without_any packing --- so it really bounced around .
neutral	if this was an electronic part it would have been damaged .
neutral	but the fa is basically a solid tube of metal with a heavy diaphragm and spring inside .
neutral	it '_s designed to work for years under bouncy road conditions .
neutral	no problem .
neutral	like i said -- they did good .
neutral	so , the negative chatter didn_'_t apply for this order -- a five_star winner recommendation does !
neutral	i purchased parts to replace the exhaust_system on my 0000_honda_civic .
neutral	i took my car to my mechanic ( professional ) to have the installation done .
neutral	an_hour or two installation took seven hours due to the modification to the so called " direct fit " parts .
neutral	in all fairness , the parts were manufactured by bosal exhaust systems .
neutral	parts were not manufactured to oem specs .
neutral	they were off just a little , just enough to make installation very difficult .
neutral	gaps between pipe flanges were wide enough that mounting_hardware ( nut , bolts and springs ) could not be used .
neutral	because of gaps bolts were too short and springs to long .
neutral	i double_checked the packing_slip and all parts ordered were correct .
neutral	manufacturer does not hold close tolerances !
neutral	i ' d think_twice before using bosal parts !
neutral	good selection
neutral	prices are good , and initially i was not upset about the shipping and just accepted it .
neutral	however , i paid $_00 in shipping for a 0 . 0lb package and it has literally hopped states back and forth from my own .
neutral	it went to indianapolis , then to kentucky , then straight across to illinois .
neutral	i live in indiana and for that high a shipping cost , it should not take a week to get it in my opinion .
neutral	shipping has_been my only issue though and i had no transactional problems .
neutral	i wasn_'_t aware that i called a third_party site .
neutral	i was stuck alongside the road , and needed to book a hotel for the night .
neutral	the woman was hard to hear ( probably due to the noise on my end ), and she set me up for the wrong night .
neutral	when i found this out , i called back .
neutral	the woman i talked with was considerate , and took_care of the problem .
neutral	it did take about 00_minutes to get the problem fixed , but that could have been due to the fact that it was a third_party site calling a hotel where the receptionist didn_'_t speak_english very well .
neutral	if the second operator is allowed to read the review , i do want to apologize .
neutral	i was stressed out , and was somewhat rude to her , while she was only trying to help me .
neutral	she , on the other hand , was courteous and did everything she could to get things fixed quickly .
neutral	i received a call to say teh oil would be delivered the next_day - no oil came - i rang the supplier who could not help !
neutral	called again on monday to be told that we were on " stop " even_though boilerjuice had taken the money .
neutral	lady said she would call back - she did not but oil arrived !
neutral	received order as specified .
neutral	carton was much larger than the size of the filters .
neutral	there was some packing_materials in with the filters which afforded enough protection .
neutral	however , the quality of the filters was less_than i expected .
neutral	two of the filters had the seams coming apart and the frame of the filters was not reinforced on both_sides making the filters flimsy .
neutral	would not order from this company again .
neutral	on the surface a quick and easy experience with similar prices to other web based tyre vendors .
neutral	product was correct and , really , you would have to be an_idiot to get the wrong product , plenty of help on the site regards this .
neutral	delivery though , is a catch all , unless you pay a premium , there is no tracking for your order ( that i could find in any email comms ), or even a call from the courier to check delivery was possible and unless you have all day spare to wait in for delivery you risk missing your order , not very conducive to modern , fast paced life .
neutral	i had to make other arrangements so as not to miss delivery .
neutral	£_00 for standard delivery , i would expect a tracking service .
neutral	all that said , everything else went_smoothly
neutral	car was great and collection at cherbourg went fine once we worked out how to content them .
neutral	however , big disappointment was fact car had a gps and we were advised to rent one separately from autoeurope so we had two and wasted ~ 00_usd .
neutral	highly disappointing not to have been advised this in advance - we feel_cheated .
neutral	i got the correct parts in a timely_manner .
neutral	however , the gasket that came with the exhaust_manifold was damaged in transit .
neutral	partsgeek offered to let_me return the whole works at my expense ; it was cheaper to just go to the local parts store and replace it .
neutral	overall not too bad .
neutral	i found partgeek . com to be very price - friendly but also , very aloof when a simple phone_call would answer a question .
neutral	while i have not tried to install my parts yet , i trust that they are the correct items for my vehicle .
neutral	recieved two parts wrong , havent installed the rest yet
neutral	i was generally happy with the transaction , my only grumble was that the right hand lens was not quite right .
neutral	i am unable to measure the strength of the lens as i have not the equipment .
neutral	i considered sending it back but was unsure_whether the fault was in the manufacture or in the prescription i had provided .
neutral	this is of course a problem with mail order .
neutral	good route , thoughful stops .
neutral	hard seats but reasobably comfortable .
neutral	fairly awful guide - too much trivia .
neutral	don_'_t need to know about primark or sean bean '_s marriages .
neutral	no mention of bush house , home of bbc for 00 years ; royal festival hall , museums etc .
neutral	the only reason i consider travel_insurance is that i would like to be covered in the event of something happening at home that would disrupt my holiday .
neutral	all other events i can accept or i have other cover i . e .
neutral	sickness .
neutral	i understand wanting a credit_card to hold a reservation , but actually charging the card for a reservation that is several months out doesn_'_t seem right .
neutral	most credit_cards allow for pending charges without actually charging the card .
neutral	the pc it self is a world class custom_built computer and i would recommend anyone to buy from dinopc .
neutral	my only problem with dinopc is with the delivery .
neutral	it took up to a month for it to finally be ready to ship , even then it was delayed by a further 0days because they didn_'_t have the required packaging to send it .
neutral	everytime i order from the web i get everything delivered very fast to my house and also i like the low_prices and the free stuff they have on there but one thing i don_'_t like that they charge alot of money for shipping !!
neutral	!
neutral	it took 0 days to get the part i needed the next_day .
neutral	i would have been happy to pay for faster shipping options .
neutral	usually i find boilerjuice service good but this time i ordered and paid for 0000_litres but was only delivered 000 .
neutral	if you are short delivered they do not come_back to deliver the shortfall you are stuck with whatever has_been left .
neutral	then to add_insult to the injury boilerjuice do not refund your money but keep the several_hundred_pounds and put it in your " tank account " and you have to ask for it to be returned .
neutral	when boilerjuice take a payment from your bank_account it goes within minutes but when they have to make a return payment it takes days .
neutral	i asked boilerjuice about this and was told this " was a more secure method " " and " the .
neutral	vast_majority of our customers are happy to leave their money in their accounts with us to go towards their next orders ".
neutral	can it really be true that after customers who have bought something and the company has failed to deliver the customer is happy to leave £_000 '_s of pounds with the company for next time ???
neutral	?
neutral	comparing most of the big travel sites , travelocity consistantly came up with the lowest_price every time for a flight , hotel , and car deal to charleston , sc in april .
neutral	it was after i had already paid for all this that i realized that the reason it was lower was because it did not include the rental_car .
neutral	i know i pressed the vacation package button .
neutral	anyway , it '_s my fault for not double - checking my itinerary before paying .
neutral	there is something wrong with your vacation button because i just did it again , with the same result .
neutral	please fix it so others will not have to purchase the rental_car separately like i '_m going to have to .
neutral	one of the other_sites may have been lower with the rental_car included , but i don_'_t even want to know , now .
neutral	not as satisfied as i would like to have been .
neutral	couldn_'_t reach anyone by phone .
neutral	return service to slow .
neutral	the positive is that u guys have many hard to get parts .
neutral	i will still do_business with u , hopefully customers service gets better soon .
neutral	nuf_said .
neutral	in few words .
neutral	i received the stethoscope i ordered in good condition , however , the packaging / box was crushed on one corner .
neutral	i believe this could have been avoided if they put the product in a box instead of a large flimsy envelope .
neutral	the first batch of alph brain i bought was great .
neutral	after they changed the formal it just doesn_'_t do the trick .
neutral	joe_rogan says he pops 0 or 0 alph brain anytime he uses them , and at around $ 0 a pill that is to much for me now .
neutral	the front tyres were pretty unbalanced , which should have been noticed by personnel before renting out .
neutral	i ordered two_separate items from the catalog that were to receive volume discounts of 00_% and 00 %.
neutral	the discount was not applied and i will have to call up and complain .
neutral	i hope that they can fix the web_site to accurately_reflect what is in the catalog .
neutral	the order process was simple and too the point .
neutral	the only reason i gave 0_stars was due to my order being shipped to the wrong_address and city 0 , 000_miles_away .
neutral	that caused the part i ordered to be out of stock when they reshipped and i was shipped an_alternate part overnight .
neutral	this one time issue will not stop me from ordering parts from this company .
neutral	i purchased the pet safety led light .
neutral	i ordered 0 of them .
neutral	all had batteries included , but none worked .
neutral	i had to go out and buy batteries .
neutral	not a big_deal , but since they did have batteries included , i figured the product would work right_away .
neutral	the pricing point was right , i just wish the product worked right out of the box .
neutral	i purchased new batteries and the pet safety light is great on late night walks .
neutral	i even put one of my keychain .
neutral	thanks .
neutral	if these items are on sale at the pet_store , it '_s cheaper to buy them there .
neutral	the convenience of delivery is nice , but to me the price is more important .
neutral	i can always find something on sale at the pet_store .
neutral	also , we buy canned_cat_food from petflow and it '_s annoying that it only comes in large boxes of a single flavor .
neutral	our cats are a bit picky , and if i order the wrong kind by_accident ( or they change their minds about it ) they will barely touch it .
neutral	this would be alright if i only bought one can of the wrong kind , but what am i supposed to do with 00 tins of food they hate ?
neutral	i would like to review the part i ordered but i still have not received the part i ordered .
neutral	first time i called they said they would call me back within two_days after 0 days i called again this time they said they would call me on monday still have not called me back
neutral	i described what i wanted and was sent a o ring for £ 0 and the rest maybe i didnot explain well enough but i have a thousand assorted o_rings in a box that cost me about £ 0 so no way would i have paid that for this part . other dealing_with shower docter have been first_class
neutral	it took a few_days until despatch and left us wondering_if it wa sgoing to turn up .
neutral	couldn_' track the order
neutral	i have dealt_with mcm since the mid 0000 '_s .
neutral	i even convinced the federal government to use them as a supplier .
neutral	both myself and the feds are frusterated by numerous backorders , deceptive shipping policies and excessive shipping_charges that appear after the fact .
neutral	on the other hand , the advertised prices are good as well as the selection , yet items arrive damaged since despite outrageous shipping_charges the items are packed and boxed poorly and handled carelessly !
neutral	many of us , including the feds , are shopping around for a different vendor .
neutral	three stars is therefore a generous rating for mcm .
neutral	bought a new front_grill insert to replace a busted one on a mazda 0 .
neutral	the part was rather large and only had a clear plastic_bag around it for protection so the mounting tabs broke off during shipment since it was not boxed up at all .
neutral	i bought a lower intake_manifold and in the partsgeek site it says that all seals and gaskets are included .
neutral	the manifold came but no gaskets did .
neutral	items arrived quick , n really good quality .
neutral	only problem one of the items was a different_colour to what i ordered so emailed them back asking to swap it and over a week_later still not heard_anything .
neutral	petflow '_s prices are great , however there are some annoyances .
neutral	twice_now when i have ordered blue_buffalo doggy biscuits they have been crushed and were nothing but crumbs .
neutral	i also ordered two bags of merrick dog_food , but when i tried to reorder it was out of stock .
neutral	i ended_up having to order another brand and it took over two_weeks to get here .
neutral	i like to keep my dogs eating the same food to avoid stomach upset .
neutral	positives_:
neutral	very good ui and better online experience than other competitors .
neutral	rewards_program is great .
neutral	negatives :
neutral	i '_ve had at_least 0 situations in last month where a restaurant they say will deliver or has a particular food doesn_'_t do one or either of those things at the time i ordered .
neutral	i never received a call and just recently on this last time finally got an_email from delivery . com .
neutral	the delivery . com app crashes often .
neutral	so frustrating when you are placing a large order and forced to start again .
neutral	would like to be able to search by a specific_type of food - when searching now it just searches the restaurant name but not the menus .
neutral	0 silly mistakes , one packing error and one engineering error mean delays for me , not good service as they have been .
neutral	most of the clothes are very nice but the fabric is delicate which means the clothes need to be hand washed ( my greatest weakness )
neutral	a good meet and greet service and comparable with any of the others that we regularly use .
neutral	however , when picking our car up at_heathrow t0 there was some_confusion about where to meet as they had recently changed the arrangements .
neutral	the instructions were ambiguous and they didn_'_t seem sure about what was happening .
neutral	i am sure it is sorted by now and the driver was very apologetic ( the man on the end of the phone was not so good ).
neutral	the price was a bit misleading .
neutral	the amenity charge each day from the hotel and the premium seating charges should have been disclosed in the package price .
neutral	there was no one at the front_desk so we had to wait for someone to come from the back room so we could get our key .
neutral	i found that unproffessional and not very welcoming .
neutral	doing a lot of traveling we did find it inconvenient that the toilet didn_'_t flush appropriately and we had to ask for more toiletries .
neutral	we booked for two adults and we didn_'_t get enough supplies so we had to request more .
neutral	the bed was perfect and very comfortable and the room was very welcoming .
neutral	the location was the most convenient location we have ever stayed in .
neutral	off the main road so no traffic noise and so close to shopping and food .
neutral	when we checked out in the am , 00 was right there so we could continue on our way without the in town traffic .
neutral	the vouchercode of 0 euro didnt work and after sending an_email about that i didnt get an answer .
neutral	im very disappointed about that .
neutral	firstly i can understand_why the website went down during the time i was trying to place an order .
neutral	secondly when i asked about the quality of the disks that they were supplying they just told me to try them out .
neutral	thirdly when i received my parcel its was not exactly secure as it was open .
neutral	i don_'_t know if that was caused_by the courier or done during packing .
neutral	i used sparefoot to help find a storage location for an estate that i am clearing .
neutral	while the site helped make quick work in getting to a " short list ", i found myself being stuck with an extra $ 0 monthly_fee that this site apparently overlooked in its comparison information .
neutral	the site helps , but call the storage location you are thinking of renting from before submitting a reservation .
neutral	spend £_00 + on a bag of protein and don_'_t even get a scoop to use as they recommend .
neutral	surely it only costs a minimal_amount to provide one .....
neutral	the advertised delivery time for our order was 0 - 0 business days .
neutral	it took a whole nine_days for my parts to be delivered , and that is not satisfactory in my opinion .
neutral	i was informed that the car would be taken about six miles_away for storage .
neutral	i made a note of the mileage on handover at the start of our hols and at the end when i picked_up the car afterwards .
neutral	i believe the car was driven for a total of 00 miles approx , round_trip .
neutral	i needed to get started to home so did not challenge their people at the airport .
neutral	we were ' sucked in ' by the excess_insurance pushed by argus , but when we tried to cancel the same , they side stepped responsibilty and we had to deal directly with the insurer ... true customer service would have ' owned this ' and sorted it for us ... car fine ...
neutral	recently booked my car into the ncp long_term car_park .
neutral	the car_park was so full it took me approximately 00 / 00_minutes driving round and round to eventually find a space .
neutral	not impressed !!
neutral	!

neutral	motivul ratigului meu este modalitatea defectuoasa de_livrare .
neutral	adica : daca eu fac comanda la ora 00 dimineata , si aleg curierul , am pretentia ca a doua_zi produsele sa ajunga la mine , pt ca_nu degeaba am dorit curier rapid .
neutral	in cazul dumneavoastra nu s - a intamplat asa .
neutral	am_facut comanda la 00 dimineata , apoi am_fost sunat de_catre un reprezentant instiintandu - ma ca produsele imi vor fi trimise abia a doua_zi , ca peste inca o zi sa ajunga la mine fara a - si cere scuze din partea companiei .
neutral	pentru mine e mai mult de 00 de_ore . mai aveti de lucru la partea de logistica .
neutral	in rest toate bune .
neutral	may i suggest you determine the specific reading interests of your customers and amend your database accordingly .
neutral	i for one am not interested in books outside me fields of interest and do not feel inclined to wade_through book lists in the hope of finding something of interest .
neutral	i also tend to buy more books from post script books as generally the prices are lower .
neutral	then if something unexpected happens that isn_'_t covered by insurance you are stuck !
neutral	i have a dream , that one day we will be able to book confidently months in advance knowing we can change our itinerary if the need_arises and it is not covered by travel_insurance !
neutral	some bike components can be very expensive to return .
neutral	a free or discounted returns service is needed
neutral	i think partsg is good but no means of follow_up .
neutral	on one ocausion i bought front_end parts for my 0000_f000 and never received them .
neutral	i emailed and got no respond " no phone #"
neutral	still_havent recieved my product
neutral	very cool with coolness beyond all cool of cools .
neutral	no im just kidding .
neutral	its moderate .
neutral	im only writting this review because i keep receiving emails asking me to write a review .
neutral	here '_s your god damn review !
neutral	are you happy now !?!
neutral	?
neutral	terence kuan .
neutral	d add said ( delivery in 00_hours ) will it took 00 days yo get to me .
neutral	and it came on a very cold day .
neutral	now i '_ll have to wait_until it warms_up to put it on .
neutral	if u say i have to wait 00 days , then i '_ll wait 00 days , but if u say 00_hrs ., then that '_s what i expect .
neutral	i was disappointed that several plants i ordered were not included which means i cannot complete palnting them until the missing ones arrive .
neutral	also , there was an unannounced substitution that i had to sort out .
neutral	the plants were very healthy when they arrived .
neutral	quality of print was average
neutral	well i was sent the wrong part that was broke .
neutral	but was sent the correct one promptly .
neutral	the order process is fairly straightforward , but to ensure delivery of the cards i used the usps delivery confirmation for each card .
neutral	on one order there were three cards going to two different_addresses and each one cost $ 0 . 00 for this service .
neutral	my choice and i am totally fine with the charges , but when i didn_'_t receive a " order shipped confirmation " email i had to call for status on two of the cards .
neutral	since i paid for the service i should have received the email with tracking_information for all three cards .
neutral	the young_lady on the phone was pleasant and helpful but should not have been needed and that was disappointing .
neutral	she assured me the cards were on their way so maybe this is premature as the last two have not been received yet .
neutral	she said they were in the hands of usps and i understand you have no control over that , but i should have tracking_information .
neutral	you can save a lot of money using this site once your done navigating it after 00_minutes
neutral	being in a competitive industry , my only view is that of getting quotes in a more timely_fashion .
neutral	glasses in a soft package which left me a bit fearful as to what i would find inside .
neutral	thankfully nice solid hard case , unfortunately glasses were loose inside , could have damaged frames or chipped lenses .
neutral	frame is of a standard quality .
neutral	i ordered standard lenses , quality is ok .
neutral	i bought the frames as a 000 offer and used a discount_code , so got them for a bargain .
neutral	if i had paid full price for the i would have been upset with the finish on the edge of the lenses , they are both supra frames ( half frame , half supra cord ) the edge of both sets arn '_t polished one set set had lens dust still there , one has the end of the supra cord sticking out and residue from the flat cord that helps the supra cord into lens .
neutral	i was an optical technician for many_years , so noticed these things straight_away .
neutral	i cant very well go into an opticians and ask them to take the lenses out and polish them , firstly because i didn_'_t buy from them , plus the risk of chipping the lenses .
neutral	like i said because they were a bargain i have not complained but i have a white rim everytime i put them on now .
neutral	decent quality frame and lenses , quality control , fit and finish let them down .
neutral	hope this is constructive critiscism to improve your service
neutral	the options and features and layout possibilities are really great , but it is the slowest application i have ever_seen .
neutral	000 jpgs need ~ 00_minutes .
neutral	product was fine but not what was pictured on the web_site .
neutral	the pictures on the web_site show drawers under the frame but they are an extra_cost item not included with the frame .
neutral	also , the assembly_instructions provided were not for the model i purchased .
neutral	i had to call the store and have them email me the proper assembly_instructions .
neutral	also had two screws on the frame that were not aligned properly .
neutral	i had to remove them , plug the off center holes and drill new holes .
neutral	i ordered a set of rear footpegs for my vespa s000 .
neutral	the product is great and the shipping was fast , but the instructions provided by the manufacturer were inadequate .
neutral	they said that i had to " trim " the body panels on my vespa but gave absolutely no guidance as to how the panels should be trimmed .
neutral	then i wrote to sip and was told in a lighthearted response that i had trimmed the pieces incorrectly ( i knew that !
neutral	), with no guidance on how i might now proceed to trim the pieces correctly to ensure proper fitment of the footpegs .
neutral	i am still trying to get information from sip , and from the footpeg manufacturer , on how to make all this work properly .
neutral	more help is needed for inexpert do - it - yourselfers like myself .
neutral	the delivery was very slow
neutral	i ordered two pair of glasses -- one locally and one online with frames_direct .
neutral	it took frames_direct two_weeks longer to get me the glasses then the local store .
neutral	they were about 0 / 0 the price though .
neutral	in the future , i will get a quote from frames_direct and then take that to my local eye store and have them match it .
neutral	i just bought and installed a tail_light_assembly for my 0000 grand_caravan .
neutral	i got a great price , while it fits , it '_s a little smaller than the original part .
neutral	there is now a slight gap and water now collects on that side .
neutral	i don_'_t know if all suppliers get their parts from overseas , but i might pay a little more to find out next time .
neutral	printerinks obviously have other_companies that can fulfill orders but they do not tell you at the time of ordering .
neutral	we received items from what looked like an unconnected company , the order number was completely different & one of the items was wrong , even the company that sent the items could not figure_out that the order was sent to them from printerinks .
neutral	they did not answer any of my emails but when i called them to check on the order & explained what happened with the delivery the correct items where sent the next_day .
neutral	my husband was in rehab for eleven weeks in 0000 and had a very bad bacterial infection from diarrhea , which lasted for a long time .
neutral	these wipes , used by the facility , were very soothing to help him keep the area very clean .
neutral	he was so pleased with them that i continued ordering them when he returned home and will_continue to use them .
neutral	thank_you mckesson !
neutral	if you order the universal oxygen_sensor , i t is not totally universal .
neutral	the description on line does not explain this .
neutral	when i called partsgeek , they do not provide any assistance or advice on how to work around this problem .
neutral	the sensor works only with 0 or less wires and the kia has a five wire sensor so there was no way to guess which wires were the heater wires and which connected to the computer on the kia .
neutral	the rear sensor hooked up ok .
neutral	i have yet to receive a confirmation_email after a week of ordering .
neutral	i have found everything that i '_m looking for , i just hope i get it .
neutral	once i get my products , my opinion might change , but as my header_says , sitting on pin and needles .
neutral	normally i would give petflow 0_stars but my last order took 0 days just to get processed and over a week to get to my home .
neutral	i understand shipping is free ( if it wasn_'_t i would not use this service but 0 days to get 0 bags of food is not 0_star worthy .
neutral	i am sure it will be better next time as i have received orders in 0 days in the past .
neutral	the shipping cost is too high .
neutral	i was hoping to buy a head bolt set for a miata i guess i miss clicked the item and received 0 head bolt instead of 00 bolts .
neutral	at that price i would have been paying $_000 for a set .
neutral	i was a little disappointed when the shipment arrived .
neutral	i will be buying more parts from partsgeek but will have to pay more attention to details .
neutral	i will be really pissed if my miata engine fails as to using second_hand parts - bar one .
neutral	i have a freshbenies benefits program through work that gives me a good discount on frames ( or contacts , thought i don_'_t wear them ) through framesdirect . com .
neutral	i needed some prescription_sunglasses and was able to find just what i needed there .
neutral	specifying the lenses was a straightforward process .
neutral	curiously , they wanted me to provide a copy of my eye_doctor '_s actual prescription ( in addition to filling in the data from that prescription ), which i don_'_t recall having to do when i ordered from coastalcontacts . com , but they accommodate several different methods for making that happen .
neutral	the completeing the checkout_process went without_incident .
neutral	the only hiccup was that , a few_days after the order was placed , i received an_email from " sarah sheridan " saying that the frames i ordered had been backordered , and asking if i wanted to substitute another pair .
neutral	i happen to have done a bit of " recreational " shopping at the site and already had another pair ( same manufacturer , same lenses , same price ) in the shopping_cart , so i just copied / pasted that info from the shopping_cart page into my reply email .
neutral	after a week i still hadn_'_t received any kind of acknowledgement from " sarah ," nor was there any change in my order status on the site , so i sent another email to follow_up .
neutral	there was no direct response .
neutral	however a few_days_later -- but still well before the backorder date she ' d indicated -- i received notice that the original order had shipped via_usps .
neutral	and a few_days_later my glasses were safely perched on my face , so it all worked out fine , if perhaps with some small delay on shipping / delivery .
neutral	i '_m not sure why sarah introduced doubt into the process , then reinforced it by not being subsequently responsive , but it all worked out fine .
neutral	my discount program is good enough that i '_m quite likely to shop there again .
neutral	sales service was very good , arrived next_day as_promised , all parts intact
neutral	but when the pump developed a fault after four months the dialog with after sales service went on an age , talking me through a number of checks and more checks that in the end he wore me down to such an degree that i ordered a new pump that i am pleased to say arrived the next_day
neutral	p s the old shower pump is sitting in the shed
neutral	these doors look very modern and appear well made .
neutral	they look lovely hung .
neutral	my only_complaint is some look like seconds .
neutral	they have repairs in them which are very rough .
neutral	the visit to the showroom in wigan was excellent , matt was very helpful and processed the order immendialey and easily .
neutral	the next stage - delivery was not as agreed , i didnt receive a call for a while and when i did , the guy on the phone was very rude when i said i needed the bathrom delivering to another house about 000metres away from my home .
neutral	he said this wasnt possible , so dont ask !!
neutral	obviously the customer doesnt have a say even_though they are paying for delivery .
neutral	next i visited the depot in leigh to pick_up extra items , firtsly the staff couldnt find the order and then i had to wait 00mins for them to find the order ( a bag of adhesive and some edgings , no one else was being served .
neutral	), when i asked if the order had gone_through they said someone in the back was finding it .
neutral	0 of them were stood at the desk whilst i waited , they were doing nothing , i even filmed them .
neutral	they didn_'_t bother to help the poor guy_who seemd to be on his own in the back !!
neutral	this has tainted what started as a very good experience .
neutral	my car was diesel vauxhall badly in need of a tune up , badly_scratched and dented . did not meet north american rental standards . hertz can do better .
neutral	part look to be good some came in two_days and others more than a week
neutral	i liked the overall location and the look of the storage_facilities
neutral	used priceline during cross - country road trip .
neutral	used it to book 0 rooms and 0 out of 0 booking had problems .
neutral	priceline refunded me $_00 for " inconvenience " for one mix_up ( hotel i was supposed to be in was overbooked and they put me up in an absolutely filthy dump ... shouldn_'_t have even had a 0_star_rating ).
neutral	in second incident , i arrived after 00_hours of plane rides / airport layovers to find that only 0 of my 0 rooms had been reserved ( though the priceline confirmation clearly showed two ).
neutral	took a while to straighten this out and get my family checked in .
neutral	hotel claimed it was because priceline had me listed as an amex payer and they do not accept amex .
neutral	the online order screen should tell the shopper that they are ordering a used binder filled with looseleaf pages and not getting an actual book .
neutral	the binder was so crushed that the rings didn_'_t fit together and the pages could be turned .
neutral	huge waste of money on my part .
neutral	i returned the item ( at my expense ) and won_'_t shop bookbyte again .
neutral	so , the pods out a little smaller than nespresso ones but they work fine in the machine and long as you don_'_t posh them in to hard as they can fall through !
neutral	taste and appearance of coffee is great .
neutral	i have not received the part yet so i don_'_t know if my experience was good .
neutral	maybe you should set_up your system to send me an_email to rate your service after i receive the merchandise
neutral	i realise it is a busy time of year but when you are offered next_day delivery , pay for next_day delivery - you expect to get a next_day delivery .
neutral	i didn_'_t .
neutral	we waited about a month to receive the filters with no status_updates on the web_site .
neutral	the arrangement was attractive , with nice flowers , but given that it was the ' medium ' size , we were surprised how small it was .
neutral	it was also supposed to be in a wooden trug , but was in a plastic basket container which we would not have chosen ourselves .
neutral	you need to revise to phone system .
neutral	to order just one part took me almost 0 hours to put the order through .
neutral	when you call in it rings then a song comes on and when it over your automated_system comes on and says that all reps . are still busy and then_hangs_up .
neutral	it doesn_'_t give you an option of whether you want to stay on the line and hold or whatever it just hangs_up .
neutral	it took me almost three hours of going through this before i reached a representative and then when i told_him what i needed he placed me on hold then a few_minutes later the phone line got hung_up on me .
neutral	then i had to repeat the same prfocess over again and listen to the same song for another hour before a rep .
neutral	picked_up the line .
neutral	you have a very poor phone system for customer service and should be revised completely other than that i am completely_satisfied .
neutral	the 0 lengths of tile edging i ordered came in a clear plastic_wrapping , which served as no protection_against damage . both the items were damaged . i . e various dents along the lengths , which are quite difficult to straighten . as these items were of a fairly soft material , i was surprised that they were not packed in a cardboard_tube
neutral	the big_bus_tour is a great way to see the highlights of london .
neutral	that is , if you take the live guide bus .
neutral	we were stuck inside the recorded_commentary bus on the lower section during the middle of a rainstorm .
neutral	not the tour '_s fault .... except none of the headphone jacks worked .
neutral	those that did work were already taken by other passengers , who resorted to stretching their wires across seats in order to plug into a working jack .
neutral	we booked our tickets online and tried to board the bus .
neutral	nowhere was it mentioned that these tickets would need to be swapped out at a particular station ( or at all ).
neutral	the confirmation simply says you have to print out and bring along your e_- voucher .
neutral	the first driver let us on , but he said we would have to speak to a staff_member in order to get our actual tickets .
neutral	fair enough .
neutral	we never ran_into a staff_member , and when we got off to try to do our river_cruise , we were turned away by the extraordinarily rude 0rd - party cruise operators .
neutral	we told them we completely understood they couldn_'_t let us on the boat without having a proper ticket from a staff_member ( and really , we did understand and did not try to argue the point ), but asked whether they could tell us * where * we could find a staff_member , as we had been all over and not encountered one ( likely because of the weather ).
neutral	they responded with a " don_'_t know , don_'_t care ," looked past us , and used an arm to sort of move us out of the way .
neutral	it was extremely unprofessional , and i was a bit put off that the big_bus_tour would use such a company to in essence represent it on the river_cruise portion .
neutral	we were able to get back on a bus with a live guide in the hopes of finding another staff_member ( we rode to the end of the line at green_park and still never saw anyone ).
neutral	our guide was lovely ( truly , the live guides are what make these tours worth going on ), but we were not pleased with the overall service , the non_- working jacks , and the rude cruise company attendants .
neutral	not a bad site that works along with bill me later . com ; a few more hotel choices .
neutral	call_center customer service for bookit . com could be much friendlier .
neutral	the customer service agent i spoke with didn_'_t seem to be very interested or care about my questions / concerns .
neutral	he didn_'_t offer any information or help either .
neutral	more choices with hotels regarding bill me later would be better .
neutral	hotwire is much more user_friendly , but hotel choice is very limited ; more so than bookit . com .
neutral	it would be nice to see all hotels included in the bill me later . com program .
neutral	bookit website could be better .
neutral	better search and map for instance .
neutral	i did make a reservation for the first time ; even with all the horror_stories_about it .
neutral	i '_ll be very disappointed if my reservation doesn_'_t go through .
neutral	the website states it takes seven_days for the reservation to engage .
neutral	weird ...
neutral	if it doesn_'_t , i will be cancelling and utilizing a different service going forward .
neutral	thank_you !
neutral	i have actually cancelled my jalbum account ( s ) because for some reason , it appears i have two accounts !
neutral	not sure how this happened but there is apparently no way the two accounts can be merged so if am to maintain the integrity of jalbum links offered in a football forum , i need to convert each of my albums manually and amend the links on the forum in question .
neutral	since the albums cover 0 years worth of work or more , i am not prepared to put in that much time and effort to get all of the links corrected by re - uploading the albums and re - linking on the forum .
neutral	i have switched to flickr pro because thecost of unlimited uploads is les than the cost of renewing the pro subscription in jalbum
neutral	flickr uploads more quickly and easily too .
neutral	sorry jalbum !
neutral	you lose !
neutral	i bought two cartridges for my hp c0000 printer for less_than one hp .
neutral	the only issue i see with the remanufactured cartridge is i can '_t realign the print head :( so if you want ink on paper pretty close to where you want it buy ink here .
neutral	very simple to use , particularly with a phone app to speed up scanning cds .
neutral	easy to post everything too using collect +.
neutral	however , there seems to be a long lead time between items appearing as processed , to verifying payment to sending payment to receiving payment .
neutral	whilst the website is well_constructed and clearly has a close engagement with most if not all hotels and hostels in the desired city i was visiting , i had minor greviances with issues of a more practical manner .
neutral	upon booking i was quoted a price , only for that price to inflate with taxes and extra fees not once , but twice !
neutral	i accepted the inital increase as it was taxes and it was only a slight increase , however , i could find no reason for the second increase .
neutral	my budget was below 000 so to be quoted 000 only to eventually be presented with 000 was quite irritating , especially as it was not until after initiating the booking that these costs presented themself .
neutral	there should be a clearer indication that this is the case , as now i have to justify to my friends why we are paying more than the price i quoted them originally .
neutral	hi ,
neutral	we took bigbustour together with my daughter .
neutral	we used headphones to listen the story in russian .
neutral	overall we are quite satisfied with the service .
neutral	but i belive there is a room for improvement .
neutral	first of all i think you could provide more information about historical places , more interesting facts .
neutral	taking into_consideration the trafic problems in london i think it would not be an exaggeration to say that up to 00_% of our time on board we where just listening to music in our headphones .
neutral	this time in traffic jams could be used more wisely - for example by providing some general facts from the great british history .
neutral	another major issue is the music itself .
neutral	your choice of music is good and appropriate , but believe me - the quality of the headphones makes it hardly tolerable for anyone especially when listening for such a long time .
neutral	the headphones are ok for voice but not good for music .
neutral	many_thanks ,
neutral	roman
neutral	simple user_friendly web_site , good job :)
neutral	didn_'_t do what i asked for lack of communication
neutral	your photobook product is very good , and you created it very quickly , however it took over a week to arrive after it was dispatched .
neutral	i had to call to try to track it but because it was tnt there was no information .
neutral	i was promised a call back but never received one .
neutral	eventually it arrived , but surely , should not have taken so long .
neutral	the slow delivery and poor information detracted from the product .
neutral	i buy a reasonable_amount online but very rarely come_across an organisation that takes 0 - 0 days to despatch any goods .
neutral	there appears to be no reason presented as to why this should be .
neutral	i don_'_t know the organisation of this company to perhaps the warehousing function is outsourced and perhaps this leads to some delay .
neutral	ordering was easy , price was better_than most , and shipping was good .
neutral	filter quality appears workable , but the folds had imperfections .
neutral	they looked like they had been stuffed into the cardboard shell .
neutral	inconsistent spacing on the folds .
neutral	i suspect this may affect the performance of the filter .
neutral	the on line pictures give a very good impression of the watches but when my mx00 arrived i was pleasantly_surprised to see what a stunning and rugged looking watch it was .
neutral	i chose the mx00 for the plain easy to read dial ( day and night ) and i wasn_'_t disappointed here either .
neutral	i asked for an extra link after it arrived and this followed within a couple of days .
neutral	having had the watch now for a couple of months i have to say that i am disappointed with the strap .
neutral	i chose the metal bracelet , and since fitting the extra ( which i did myself with the proper tools ) the pin holding this link keeps protruding from the strap slightly and needs pushing in .
neutral	even more annoying is the strap keeps coming apart because the spring loaded pin doesn_'_t hold it together securely enough and the watch falls off my wrist .
neutral	i have made the company aware of these problems each time , they have always been very pleasant , but i am now fed up with this happening and the latest response from the company is to offer to send me some glue to hold the pin in firmly ..... what on a watch this price .... no way and why should i have to do it myself .
neutral	so its going back for investigation .
neutral	good price from yourmoney
neutral	i bought a $_00 psn_card because [ competitor ] sells only $_00 and $_00 .
neutral	it '_s so easy to buy on [ competitor ] when comparing to pcgamesupply , no phone_verification required , etc .
neutral	bought a amazonia bunch in december , but stalks and flowers brown .
neutral	after a lot of discussion via_e_-_mail and sending some photos serenata agreed to replace bunch .
neutral	replacement delayed but eventually arrived and was up to standard .
neutral	previous purchases from serenata have been trouble_free .
neutral	flowers delivered in a very big box with some damage to flowers , had to trim broken stems and loose leaves and a couple of stems we ' re not good quality .
neutral	would have preferred sealed bottle provided by soloxin manufacturer , not loose .
neutral	i bought the police box iphone_0s case 0_weeks_ago as i '_m a big_fan of doctor who , whose ship is of course a police box .
neutral	the image of the case on the site shows a very clean , blue case with the police box image printed well .
neutral	the actual product i received was a black case with the police box printed poorly , off center and lacking in colour and brightness .
neutral	i won_'_t be buying from diablo skinz again .
neutral	edit_: thanks for the great customer service , maybe i '_ll reconsider revisiting diablo skinz
neutral	i ordered some dog_food from them and it didn_'_t make home in time .
neutral	i had to drive 0 hours to get some some food to get me by until i received the package .
neutral	i understand that weather was bad up north and that it was close to christmas too .
neutral	so i will give them another shot , if the same thing happens again , then , for sure i won_'_t do_business with petflow . com .
neutral	on the positive side , my dogs_love when we play with the lazer pointer .
neutral	guten tag ,
neutral	die tour hat einen sehr guten einblick in fast alle sehenswürdigkeiten londons gegeben .
neutral	die sprachliche begleitung in den bussen war ebenfalls super !
neutral	das einzige was schlecht gelaufen ist , dass wir den bus bzw .
neutral	boot nicht_mehr fahren konnten , weil die zeit nicht ausreichte .
neutral	irgendwann gegen 00uhr konnte man keinen bus mehr fahren - obwohl die tour 00h heißen .
neutral	wir mussten extra kosten bezahlen um wieder zum hotel zu kommen ( von greenwich mit_dem boot ).
neutral	wann sie diese 00h zu verwenden ??
neutral	?
neutral	i have ordered several_times from ink_station and generally found the service good and fast delivery however has several issues with leaking toner in a couple of cartridges which to their credit ink_station replaced quickly and at no charge .
neutral	my recent order was placed and dispatched on a friday and i received the parcel on the following friday .
neutral	i dont_know if this is the courier or ink_station but i didnt receive a reply to my email chacing the whereabouts of the delivery nor a return call when i rang about it , not to mention the 0000 number being engauged each time i rang .
neutral	great prices , ok quality , average service
neutral	no problem with merlin at all .
neutral	my only issue is that ukmail delivered my item to a neighbour but did not notify me .
neutral	i had to ring merlin to chase .
neutral	i had two tires put on the front plus alignment .
neutral	not sure if they failed to make_sure the tire_pressure was correct in all four tires as my tpms showed one tire still low on one of my rear tires .
neutral	small thing that they should have checked but didn_'_t .
neutral	i now need to go get air in that tire .
neutral	had a flat_tire replaced .
neutral	i could not belief that the computer system was not interconnected between stores .
neutral	they had to call fairfield store to look up my purchase info .
neutral	that added to time needed .
neutral	new tire was put on and tech neatly replaced space saver tire in well between seats .
neutral	went back about two_weeks_later for another flat .
neutral	took two hours to plug the hole .
neutral	they sure didn_'_t seem busy , and there was no communication except if i went up to desk and asked .
neutral	haven_'_t yet received the product , so am a bit_concerned .
neutral	called and found that their limited hours , limit my ability to get in touch with this company .
neutral	had e_-_mail indicating they needed me to contact them about order due to having issues with my credit_card , then found that the credit_card did get billed , but haven_'_t been able to call due to their 0 am to 0 pm limited calling time span .
neutral	they did give an e_-_mail address and i haven_'_t yet used it .
neutral	will do so now ....
neutral	i work and not easy to find time to call in these limited hours .
neutral	i like the pricing and if the product is as good as i hope - it appears to be the exact ballast i need for our favorite florescent lighting ...
neutral	i would still state , the small payment and contact issues are well_worth the fact they have the product i need .
neutral	timing of delivery will pay into my final_decision however and it '_s been over a week since i placed this order ...
neutral	im super eager to try my supplements .
neutral	i ordered them april 0rd , 0000 and today is april_00th .
neutral	seems to lengthy to me ..
neutral	in addition , the tracking says it will be estimated by the 00th , still another 0 days .
neutral	not upset , just expected the delivery within the week after my order was placed .
neutral	its early in the day ... maybe they will arrive today .
neutral	hope this helps .
neutral	the prices are great but the shipping is outrageous .
neutral	i had $_00 dollars worth of product and shipping was $_00 . 00 ... totally outrageous .
neutral	charge a little more on your products so you don_'_t have to rip the customer off and make your profit on shipping .
neutral	try using the united_states postal_services which offer flat fee rates .
neutral	i '_m on long hold times to speak with customer service and their self pay web_site doesnt work .
neutral	call in pay doesnt work either the promps keep messing up and you cant get through .. i printed my cards out online since i never received them in the mail like i was told since december .
neutral	not professional ......
neutral	there was no shipping invoice in the order when i recieved it
neutral	i order 0 parts for my car and the price was good , but when i found out they were coming from two different_warehouses and i would have to pay shipping twice i was about to cancel my order and now i see the items i want for less somewhere_else , i wish i did not get the parts now .
neutral	i could have waited and bought them from a place with free shipping .
neutral	pump came promptly but was sent to invoice address and not dilivery address causing a problem for dilivery driver .
neutral	fortunately on his second vissit a neighbour was able to take dilivery or else i would not have received it on time for contract .
neutral	i ordered two trophies which look great .
neutral	the only problem is they were held up in postage and required picking_up from the post_office and an excess postage paid because they hadn_'_t put enough postage on them .
neutral	would i use them again ?
neutral	yes , but i hope this was a one off error and not a mistake they would make again .
neutral	all parts ordered were delivered on time and in good condition
neutral	there was an error on the website that wouldn_'_t let my credit_card go through .
neutral	thought it eas my pc , tried 0 others .
neutral	thought it was the card tried a different one , bought what i needed off ebay for $_00 less .
neutral	the cost of the shirt was high
neutral	the quality of the shirt was medium
neutral	the time to deliver was long ( 0_weeks instead of a fair time of 0 days )
neutral	the delivery was done via tnt that '_s bad logistic : i had to go somewere 00 km far to get the shirt
neutral	i think i won_'_t use anymore neronote shirts
neutral	if you still have your oemmirror with the painted cover it will not fit in place of the black textured cover that comes with the mirror .
neutral	the holes are all misaligned by a few centimeters .
neutral	the product was as_described and the fit was correct .
neutral	i had to do some searching to determine how to measure for the garment as i am the end user , not someone_who measures for compression garments all the time .
neutral	i ordered on - line on a thurs and paid for 0 day delivery .
neutral	i called on friday to verify the order receipt and to insure they would be shipped on time .
neutral	i then called on monday to get a tracking_number so i could track the package .
neutral	the order was delivered about 0 : 00_pm on tuesday .
neutral	i don_'_t consider that 0 day but i didn_'_t need the item until wed .
neutral	i was not impressed with the timeliness of the shipping or the fact i had to call to get a tracking_number .
neutral	the tracking_number should have been provided by e_-_mail the same as the order confirmation .
neutral	ordered a single wrench socket ( small item ) before 0pm on wednesday .
neutral	wouldn_'_t necessarily expect despatch that day but would normally expect stock item to be despatched the next_day .
neutral	got e_-_mail to say that " item would probably miss thursdays post " also - why ?
neutral	is 00hrs not long enough to bag and stamp a single socket ?
neutral	item eventually arrived middle of following week .. too_late for work i had planned .
neutral	i got a grill for my car and the screws came out where they shouldn_'_t have , so my grill was all loose .
neutral	i used gorilla glue on the screws and set them back in place , it works now , just a little of a hassle .
neutral	nice enough folks , but my last order never arrived ,.. i called and they said they had no tracking_number ,... ugh .
neutral	then . they reshipped it 0nd day ussps , and i got it a week_later .
neutral	have never seen the first order .
neutral	as far as the ink_jet products i received ,... they work ok .
neutral	hope their shipping method improves ,... apparently none of us can_rely_on the usps anymore .
neutral	...
neutral	i '_ll have a better idea when i '_ve arrived at my destination , won_'_t i ?
neutral	we booked our flights to frankfurt a . m ., germany and was very satisfied as we saw flights that were not available , neither on united nor lufthansa .
neutral	at the time , we booked travel_insurance through a travelocity partner .
neutral	we later found a better deal and called for a refund .
neutral	we were required to write a written request for a refund .
neutral	this we did and we never received the refund .
neutral	so , maybe it '_s better to book directly with the airlines ....
neutral	i have bought parts from parts_geek in the past and it has always been a good expireince .
neutral	the prices are very competative , shipping reasonalble and fast , and i have never been_disappointed witht the quality of the parts .
neutral	recently though , i ordered some body parts on december 00nd 0000 and the order has_been processing ever since .
neutral	i have already enquired_about the status of the parts and i was simply told they would check with the warehouse .
neutral	ten days has passed and when i check tracking it still says " order processing ."
neutral	???
neutral	this has_been my only problem so_far with parts_geek .
neutral	verifies your purchase via_email , which is nice .
neutral	i wish i didn_'_t need to sign_up for another useless account , though .
neutral	i am happy with the products offered and the pricing for the most part .
neutral	but i am disappointed that i have to pay return shipping_costs .
neutral	because of that i placed half of my recent order with amazon .
neutral	b_&_h_photo lost out on $_000 . 00 .
neutral	i was concerned that i may have a problem with a dell ultrasharp u0000m monitor , several people complain_about a yellow tint in the a00 reversion .
neutral	my wife bought quite a bit of studio lighting equipment for me at christmas and was convinced by the sales_person that i needed a few items that are clearly not needed or is even necessary to make it all work .
neutral	it is obvious he was just trying to increase the sale .
neutral	i am disappointed and intend to return the items .
neutral	i will question any future advice from their sails staff and consider other_vendors when making purchases in the future .
neutral	this does not reflect on the parts i received .
neutral	i ordered the wrong part and i am trying to contact customer service at part geeks and i have not been successful .
neutral	the website tells_me to use the support_ticket feature .
neutral	that feature is not currently working .
neutral	i tried_calling and a after being on hold a recording comes on and basically tells_me that they are to busy to take my call and refers me back to the website feature that does not work !!!!
neutral	feeling a little helpless .
neutral	i need to retain a rma_number before sending this back and that would require there website feature that does not work .
neutral	to be working .
neutral	if someone can call me from customer service i would be happy .
neutral	good products , nice variety but frustrating because the leathers and the wind cheaters , pullover hoodies are all too small for me to order !!!
neutral	need more of your items available in xxxl .
neutral	i ordered these sunglasses for my son for his_birthday and was pleased with the product .
neutral	i was not too impressed with the courier service .
neutral	though .
neutral	the box was marked fragile and was totally battered upon recept !
neutral	also i put a note on my door asking for my neighbour to take the item in .
neutral	ups totally_ignored my request and i then had to ring and give an_alternative address to avoid my sunglasses being sent back to the sunglasses shop .
neutral	not sure i would use again for this reason .
neutral	three_times i wanted to book a hotel and from the time i clicked on book it the price went up !!!
neutral	!
neutral	the tank is the right part .
neutral	unfortunately it took 00 days to get here .
neutral	i know it was just before_christmas , but it was a full 0 days before_christmas .
neutral	so , the shipping was bad , but the part is correct .
neutral	not fond that the company requires you to have home / renters insurance or they charge you $_00 . 00 , there are many places that have a waiver that is signed refusing insurance on your items , as in my case , my units items have no value ??
neutral	why would i want insurance on them .
neutral	then after i drove back home to gather the policy info i brought the proof of insurance document back & what i had which was a letter_stating my personal items were insured & the name of the company , policy number , dates of exp .
neutral	i was then told this document was no good i needed the complete policy not a very good first_impression .
neutral	right now i am not very happy with service !!
neutral	i have paid on 0 accounts and keep getting messages that am about to run out of service .
neutral	currently shows that i have bit - defender loaded twice , this is how it all started !!
neutral	not happy

neutral	i recently made reservations for 0 rooms at the same hotel for the same night , you would have thought i was making them for a hotel in central_america , not in the good ole usa ... took about 00_minutes to make a simple reservation ,,, same credit_card ... same name on both rooms ....... bad_experience
neutral	i typically have good experiences with amazon , but my last few orders have been a sub - par experience .
neutral	they ' re just such a big company that you feel_like you get lost in the system .
neutral	there is no " one - on - one " type feeling when you call them .
neutral	you ' re just another number .
neutral	the first transfer i did worked very well , the second required me to put in my id details .
neutral	i tried to send a word document that i had scanned a foto of my passport into .
neutral	the screen gave no confirmation or denial that i had successfully completed the upload although the web_page gave_me a busy signal on the tab .
neutral	the system kept saying that if i had not sent my id i should do it ... i had already transferred £ 0000 to tw .
neutral	i waited for half a day then tried again to lad my id ... with the same result .
neutral	i contacted the help_desk and was just told to make_sure that i had pressed submit ( which i had both_times ).
neutral	after a day or so i went back and still nothing had happened .
neutral	looking at the type of files that could be uploaded i did notice that . doc was not listed ... so i coinverted my word file to a . pdf and tried again .
neutral	this time i quickly got conformation that my id had been uploaded and shortly afetr it was confriemd as accpeted .
neutral	it then took a few hours for the transfer that i had done a day or so before to be recoginised .
neutral	in the end the currency conversion went ok but you need to spend a bit of time on the id confromation module .
neutral	i still do not knwo if it was my . doc file that was accpeted or the . pdf file ..... you need to tell the user what is happeneing and whether the upload has_been accpeted or not .
neutral	all in all i am a fan but i was a bit frustrated with this transfer .

neutral	we have had some 0 albums from jessops but the latest one was disappointing as it did not have the clarity or brightness of previous ones .
neutral	yes we did have a few dull days but having spent time improving them with some adobe photoshop 00 the improvement did not show through .
neutral	i also find it disappointing that very useful facilities in version 00 . 00 . 00 have been removed from the latest_version 00 . 00 . 00 .
neutral	i get over this by compiling in the old version and finishing the preparation in the latest_version from which one has to order !
neutral	a little convoluted but it has_been worthwhile for the last few albums .
neutral	not sure about giving an opinion just yet - have contacted their customer_services as miele vacuum_cleaner after three uses has a fault - before comment will see how i get on with th
neutral	ordered a radiator support for my pick_up .
neutral	they sent me the wrong part .
neutral	they said that they would take the
neutral	wrong part back and credit my account .
neutral	they didn_'_t credit the shipping .
neutral	they could just ship me the right part
neutral	i would have to reorder .
neutral	reordered the part , received the right part ,
neutral	but they still charged me freight .
neutral	i have a 00 volvo 000 glt .
neutral	before my original fuel_pump died on me , i was getting 000 + miles to a tank .
neutral	now i get at best 000_miles to a tank .
neutral	i need to find a fuel_pump that is the exact width and length of my original .
neutral	what is said on the website is " compatible " is not correct .
neutral	i just have to do a better job of researching car parts before i buy .
neutral	har talt med tre efter sinalet er_blevet dårlig i höllviken i sverige .
neutral	de_lover at vende tilbage men har endnu ikke gjort det .
neutral	i am happy with the service overall but it is expensive when compared to other services .
neutral	and paying members have to pay more for additional reports that i think should be included in the monthly_fee .
neutral	especially since the monthly price was increased recently .
neutral	they did a pretty good job - price and shipping was great and timely .
neutral	but , it bummed me a out a little_bit that they said i was buying a new part and it was actually a used part .
neutral	they came when you said they would with free shipping .
neutral	the flavour of the drink is not great but its drinkable
neutral	ordered a certain part in particular but received an incorrect part
neutral	i feel that a policy that dosent respond quickly and effectivly to a problem and you have to wait on a submitted ticket to even address a problem is crazy and in that you dont get immediate responce but thru e_-_mail when a call can do better so much more quickly , this would end frustration tring to resolve an issue with the company
neutral	wow !!
neutral	the prices are amazing ..
neutral	but most of what i ordered ,( they said " in stock "", always seemed to come_back as out of stock ... and i would find that out , a day or so later ...
neutral	when i really needed it the next_day ...
neutral	very miss leading .. saying that they had one in stock one day then not in stock the next ...
neutral	identity_guard should also cover such things as atm cards , ssan , driver '_s license etc .
neutral	it should also provide credit_scores for the basic price .
neutral	it should also use accurate personal information obtained from client rather_than inaccurate personal information obtained from the web ..
neutral	experience was good - my iphone got unlocked when i followed the instructions provided .
neutral	but it was too costly - i found way cheaper option at some other place .
neutral	i used the the portal for my other iphone and it worked exactly the same way .
neutral	very good rates , passed your details on friends in worcester .
neutral	delivery delay for better price too_long on fairness and delivery man was very grumpy !
neutral	!
neutral	flowers were easily ordered at 00 . 00pm from a great online selection , and requested for same day delivery on monday .
neutral	received an_email after 0pm stating that same day delivery was unavailable so i replied and requested that they try the next_day ( tuesday ).
neutral	still hadn_'_t heard_anything by wednesday lunchtime so ' phoned and they had not received my reply so flowers still not delivered .
neutral	it is meant to be actioned on wednesday with an offer to upgrade to include a box of chocs ( with sympathy flowers ?
neutral	).
neutral	the car was good .
neutral	i think so the expierence was fine .
neutral	i have used e_- gig wizard for several months , and when i first started i could depend_on next_day service ... but recently standards have slipped , waiting 0 or 0 days for my goods to arrive .
neutral	i also e_- mailed wizard with a query it was at_least 0_weeks before i got a reply .
neutral	sorry to post negative_comments but i have to be honest or whats the point ?
neutral	the invoice told me to pick_up at the train_station .
neutral	hertz does not even have a location at the train_station .
neutral	i ended_up walking about . 0 miles to a nearby hotel where the hertz_desk was located .
neutral	i arrived to find out that auto_europe had not sent the reservation to hertz .
neutral	i was able to get on the phone with auto_europe thank_goodness and get the issue resolved within 00 - 00_minutes .
neutral	the car was nice and we received a free upgrade .
neutral	i received my new part and it wasn_'_t even useable the paging at best looked like a child had done it , i take that back i now children i could have asked to package it and it would have been 000 times better .
neutral	we all know carriers are rough on everything so why rap delicate parts like its nothing ?
neutral	the return_policy for damaged parts suck i hope i get my money back for the part .
neutral	overall i '_m not dissatisfied .
neutral	my part was very reasonably_priced and came with free shipping .
neutral	but it did take 0 days to get here .
neutral	also the description of the part said it came with everything needed .
neutral	but when i took it out of the box it had a tag that read i would need to swap over parts from my old one .
neutral	had i known that ahead of time i would have purchased them also so everything would be new .
neutral	other than that the part was exactly like the oem and installation was simple .
neutral	my order was made and paid for as one order , it was charged as two_separate_orders and was then shipped in two_separate_orders a week apart .. so much for my job that needed the parts at the same time !
neutral	!
neutral	made me look stupid by not being_able to give my customer the service promised as well my reputation and i had to discount the repair fees for the added time spent in repair !
neutral	!
neutral	i used the contact form .. got no real feedback other than it was shipped ..
neutral	yes .. one part !
neutral	what happened to the other part ??
neutral	i contact again .. to this day no reply ..
neutral	but i have received the second part with no_explanation .. be awhile if or when i order again from partsgeek !
neutral	in the past they have been good far as time and orders received .. don_'_t know if management has changed or what .. but they need to re - asses the ordering procedure as well contact procedures !
neutral	!
neutral	bought a new fridge_freezer and paid for old appliances to be taken_away - however drivers refused to take away old_fridge and freezer as these count as 0 appliances !
neutral	also still_awaiting £_00 cashback for purchasing 0 products .
neutral	excellent product , but i had some problems getting the layout correct .
neutral	couldn_'_t speak to anyone on the phone regarding my problem .
neutral	eventually , everything got worked out and my plaque was completed as desired .
neutral	although i received a prompt response that my order was not available , i was informed that a raquet with a smaller grip was available and could be built up to the required size .
neutral	having been reassured that this would make no difference to the grip definition i agreed to the purchase .
neutral	perhaps i had misunderstood that this would be done but when the raquet arrived the grip had not been adapted leaving me with inconvenience of either sending it back or getting it adjusted elsewhere ; obviously i chose the second option .
neutral	the joys of shopping online .
neutral	ordered this 0_weeks_ago .. did you guys send this via china ?
neutral	prices were great .
neutral	i have one thing i bought that looks and tastes expired , can '_t seem to find an expiration_date on it .
neutral	so that was a bit of a waste .
neutral	not sure that i would order again with the fear of getting out dated supplements .
neutral	when looking for a holiday i for my destination , think yep thats my kind of holiday then go to trip_advisor to read the reviews .
neutral	if i like what i read i book the holiday if i don_'_t i start again .
neutral	i do take some of the really bad_reviews with a pinch of salt , as there are some born moaners / whingers out in the real world
neutral	i find if what you order is from amazon themselves it arrives fairly quickly , but if it '_s from a third_party supplier it takes a lot longer usually turns up on the last date of the estimated delivery time and that is what lowers the rating in my view .
neutral	so i ordered a taillight_assembly from partsgeek . com amongst a few other things however the assembly ended_up having a minor crack and a few chipped off pieces of plastic .
neutral	normally i would have sent something like this back but i needed it for my inspection so i had no time .
neutral	i feel_like an issue like this could be avoided if they would look at the products before shipping them .
neutral	because it was bubble_wrapped and had styrofoam i doubt it was from shipping .
neutral	long , long , long_story short - tried to get a visa to brazil in time for the world_cup .
neutral	despite assurances it could be done in 0 - 0 days i didn_'_t receive my visa for about 0_weeks , causing me to miss the first usa match .
neutral	part of this was the fault of the brazilian consulate , but the initial communication from passportvisasexpress concerning delays was terrible .
neutral	plus they messed_up the mailing_address the first time around .
neutral	i did speak with one helpful person_who was finally able to address everything , but by that point i had already missed my flight .
neutral	bottom_line - i won_'_t be using them again .
neutral	i ordered a wiper linkage transmission for my f - 000 .
neutral	it arrived partially damaged , as the box was majorly over sized for the part .
neutral	one of the body connection points , a " c " type bushing insertion bracket , had one of the " c " prongs broken in half .
neutral	the package was also badly_damaged from the linkage transmission sliding back and forth during shipping causing the part to be damaged .
neutral	the rubber insert bushing was still in the package thankfully even thought there were rips / holes from said part movement .
neutral	the crank arm that connects the motor drive to the linkage arms also did not fit on the motor drive .
neutral	i had to pry the linkage arms off the supplied crank , and re - assemble with my old crank arm .
neutral	thankfully i still had the old linkage lying_around .
neutral	i am not planning on returning the linkage assembly to stockwise as i cannot spend the time waiting several weeks without functioning wipers .
neutral	i sure hope the broken attachment prong will hold strong and not affect the wipers .
neutral	needless to say i will be monitoring that connection closely .
neutral	i also hope that the plastic linkage arm bearings are the same size as the old one due to changing the crank arm .
neutral	i did not have a pair of calipers at the time to check the size and a tape_measure didn_'_t cut it .
neutral	i am_glad to have functioning wipers again , it '_s april 0rd in minnesota and we are expecting 0 - 00 inches of snow over the next two_days .
neutral	i realize that this linkage was not a ford factory part , so i can accept the crank difference .
neutral	but the packaging by stockwise was sub - par .
neutral	i may order from stockwise again , but probably not for critical / safety equipment .
neutral	i '_ve never had any_problems with the jessops photos although i '_ve only had a few items i '_ve never been_disappointed and will still use them till other wised
neutral	not the best quality of lead but what would you expect for under a couple of pounds .
neutral	the service was fast and i received my order not long after it was placed .
neutral	first , their sizes are completely nonstandard .
neutral	i '_m typically a medium but require an xl with these_guys .
neutral	second , returning an item is such a pain you may give up .
neutral	i had to stand in line at a post_office ( ups , fedex and dhl all wanted too much $ for shipping to uk ).
neutral	otherwise , shipping is very quick and i like their shirts .
neutral	good products and with very acceptable delivery times .
neutral	not happy about their supposed storewide sale and then not make it applicable to any of the items i placed for order .
neutral	don_'_t like misrepresentation in today '_s world of advertising .
neutral	one_sentence_says it all .
neutral	god dang place does not take pay_pal i was gonna use there bill me later option from pay_pal so i could do my thing but i had to pay cash to them and give out my information on my card
neutral	i was looking for ink at a better price .
neutral	shipping was good , black_ink is good , but the color_cartridge is awful .
neutral	have no red !!
neutral	!
neutral	arrived within time_slot .
neutral	left fitter to get on with job on drive way .
neutral	new tyres_fitted .
neutral	i inspected afterwards only to check that correct tyres had been fitted .
neutral	the fitter thought i was checking for damage to alloys and pointed_out some damage which was covered by a black sticky substance .
neutral	fitter said that damage was already there prior to fitting tyres and that he had photographed beforehand .
neutral	he did not offer to show me the photo '_s and i never asked to see them .
neutral	after fitter left i cleaned off sticky black substance .
neutral	one wheel in particular was marked near rim .
neutral	i was previously unaware of this .
neutral	i am not very happy about the lack of response from you .
neutral	having sent 0 e_-_mails
neutral	concerning a problem i am having with one of your cartridges which i recently
neutral	purchased from you , under this circumstance how can i rate you !
neutral	regards

neutral	na_een_zeer goede ervaring met het verkooppunt in spijkenisse , moeten wij toch hier onze teleurstelling uitspreken .
neutral	wij kochten het bed omdat wij beiden rugklachten hebben .
neutral	we kozen voor_een bed zonder elektrische bediening .
neutral	daar hebben we nu heel_erg spijt van .
neutral	de matrassen moeten eigenlijk om_de 0 maanden gedraaid worden .
neutral	dit gaan wij niet voor elkaar krijgen .
neutral	bij_het omdraaien moet de gehele achterwand losgemaakt worden en_ook het losritsen en daarna weer vastritsen is een hele klus ( zeker als_je last van je rug hebt ).
neutral	bij een uitvoering met elektrische verstelbare hoogten is deze handeling een stuk eenvoudiger omdat dan de achterwand niet los hoeft .
neutral	dit hoorden wij pas nadat we het bed hadden ontvangen .

neutral	i have a nespresso d000 and the capsules are hard to penetrate being plastic capsules rather then aluminium .
neutral	the medium coffee does not have much taste at all .
neutral	i have not tried them all but like the guatemalan .
neutral	after ordering a key with paypal .
neutral	they replied_saying please send a photocopy of your drivers_license / passport !!
neutral	i '_ve already logged in through paypal , i am sure paypal have there security sorted .
neutral	anyway , ok , i sent them a copy of my passport .
neutral	not good enough for them !!
neutral	can i send them one with me holding my passport next to my face !!!
neutral	what the f . next , i think they will be asking me to balance a fish on my head while standing on one leg .
neutral	come on !!!
neutral	i can pay everyone_else without a problem with paypal !!
neutral	its only flippin £_00 !!
neutral	that '_s last time i go through that crap .
neutral	should have read the other reviews first !
neutral	my original ford rear - view side_mirrors on both driver '_s and passenger '_s side had their own problems .
neutral	the spotting mirrors will not stay in place and jiggle up or down with road vibrations so i cannot ever keep them in a good position .
neutral	i was hoping that when i had to replace my cracked passenger_side_mirror that an aftermarket manufacturer might have found and fixed the problem .
neutral	well , no .
neutral	not only have i got another spotting mirror that finds a sweet spot too low or too high ; i also have a large top mirror that '_s not flat !
neutral	i do like the packaging material , since i have a product of roughly the same shape that could be better and much , much more quickly packed in a nice non_- woven bag instead of the foam i '_ve been using .
neutral	purchased from vision , however turned_up bent & had been sent from hong_kong .... i went with aussie company believing they had glasses here ?
neutral	service was good though but disappointed in what i received , and really ( i had to take photos of problem prior to return ) i can '_t be bothered , although i took photos they want more info ....... i will buy from australian retailers !
neutral	i received my order of pet_foods quickly and for a decent price .
neutral	i opted to sign_up for their autoship service because of a $_00 dollar discount .
neutral	the text of the offer saying " everything is under your control .
neutral	you can cancel anytime , and there are never any fees ."
neutral	but when i tried to cancel using the website , i was instead forced to call their 000 number .
neutral	the person_who took my call was very polite and tried to get me to stay on the program .
neutral	the problem i have with this is being forced to call instead of being_able to list my reason for cancellation on the site itself .
neutral	while i understand that forcing people to call is more likely to get people to retain the service , i find it very annoying .
neutral	it '_s unfortunate too because otherwise , my experience with the company was good .
neutral	the plants arrived on time and seemed to be in good condition .
neutral	i was disappointed to see the difference_between the size of a one gallon plant and three gallon plant was the size of the container ... the soil .... the plant themselves had no appreciable size difference .
neutral	organisation was good and the free tea and coffee was a nice_touch .
neutral	sadly missed out on garages , which was a pity .
neutral	many of the the caterham academy drivers which made up the bulk of the enteries did not adhere to the overtaking rules and in some_cases carried_out quite dangerous overtakes .
neutral	they were treating the day as a unofficial race in my opinion .
neutral	if the entry list had a similar academy day , i wouldn_'_t book up .
neutral	the last point marred an otherwise good day .
neutral	this was the best buy for my contacts , and the time from order to receipt of my contacts was less_than a week .
neutral	good price , good service .
neutral	i saw from shopping for my lenses that nearly all the sellers collude in the practice of adding a " processing fee " that is equal - to or greater - than the price of a set of lenses .
neutral	the stated price of lenses does not include this " processing fee " so shopping requires that you go as far as the checkout screen to find the real , final price .
neutral	although the opticontacts . com " processing fee " was substantial ($_00 . 00 ) for my order , the bottom_line for 0 boxes of lenses was less_than the other sellers that i compared .
neutral	getting the best price required about a half_hour of my time , rather_than a few_minutes .
neutral	let the buyer_beware ...
neutral	got my front valence for cobalt and they put in box so that cracked valence so i had get repaired due to problems but small parts only they don_'_t break them then !
neutral	we had a problem with the electric connection point for the washing_machine which could have been resolved by the delivery team , but they claimed they were not allowed to do .
neutral	this meant that we were unable to test that the machine was working_properly before they left .
neutral	this i find unacceptable .
neutral	i ordered a part with the year model of 0000 .
neutral	have it on my receipt / order confirmation and everything , but when i opened the product it was labeled as the 0000 model !
neutral	slight differences in the model , but i guess i have to make it work since there are no returns ... frustrating !
neutral	when the card came it was good , but the original order was cancelled for no apparent_reason by the vendor ... then i had to re - order
neutral	ordered and paid for a set of chrome rims , received standard aluminum ones by_accident .
neutral	called adsitco and they sent out a pickup notice for the wrong ones .
neutral	i had to wait_until they had received the wrong ones back at their warehouse before they would ship the correct ones out , delaying things by almost a week .
neutral	i would have perferred the replacement be sent out once they had confirmation the incorrect parts were picked_up .
neutral	in the end , everything was fine .
neutral	i will use them again .
neutral	i spent an entire evening with tech_support trying to get my smartphone to work over my internet_connection .
neutral	still no luck .
neutral	made an order , but had to do it twice , as first never shipped or had confirmation emailed .. just vanished .
neutral	tried_calling , but no one ever answered .
neutral	many calls .
neutral	emailed , and it was replied to .
neutral	parts arrived .
neutral	this could be a good place if they answered phone , or at_least email_confirmation info ... then you would know they got order .
neutral	second order i learned lesson and printed order off screen .
neutral	0 air_filters were packed in a box with no packing_material .
neutral	two of the boxes had opened and filters were partially removed from boxes .
neutral	fortunately no damage to the filters .
neutral	although i wanted 0kg , the 0kg pack was out of stock .
neutral	i was therefore forced to buy a 0 . 0kg pack .
neutral	if i bought 0 x 0 . 0kg packs this was much more than a 0kg pack .
neutral	just a thought - myprotein could have done this as a special deal , but didn_'_t .
neutral	missed a trick there .
neutral	still , the product is a good one and the price was fair .
neutral	my glasses arrived and the prescription seems right but the frames are bent out of shape and i can '_t seem to get them to sit straight on my nose - they angle to one side .
neutral	you really need to flag the quality frames .
neutral	i didn_'_t know i was buying such low quality frames although since they are cheap i knew i wasn_'_t ordering versace .
neutral	the website has all_kinds of popups some of which contain malicious content that my anti_virus_software was able to catch , thankfully .
neutral	the actual order and delivery of parts was good , quick shipping and the parts are of ok quality .
neutral	took about a month to recieve after order and paying a hefty delivery charge . during the wait there was no notification as to when i would get it , and later when i eventually called to find out what was going on i was given a date which proved to be incorrect ( came later still ) and no_explanation as to what the hold up was . lack of transparency and accountability .
neutral	after ordering my garage , i was arranging to collect from the appointed depot , when it had arrived , when i noticed that the card that it was purchased on had to be taken in to the store to collect my goods ( i had paid for it ).
neutral	so this means that only i could collect it from the store and i could not get someone to collect it for me with only the paperwork .
neutral	after a few phone_calls i was told that the reasoning behind this was security .
neutral	this i cant possible see because some one could have stolen my card and ordered the goods and then took it into the shop to collect the goods .
neutral	i would think that this idea wants to be changed
neutral	door_handle for my toyota truck broke , found the part i needed at a good price .
neutral	i ordered an all black handle , i got one with chrome on it .
neutral	overall , i '_m satisfied that i have a working door_handle again .
neutral	i have done business here many_times .
neutral	this time the product and price were good but the shipping took to dang long !
neutral	it took several days before it shipped and a long time to get here .
neutral	probably seemed worse because i really needed it .
neutral	box came in damaged and taped back up .
neutral	i don_'_t know if all my order came in or not and have been trying to call without an answer or a call back .
neutral	no_problems in booking lets_see if the delaivery of the service is as good
neutral	didnt expect to have it shipped from california .
neutral	it stayed in nevada for 0 or more days .
neutral	well , flights were a little shade especially flight home .
neutral	a lot of hidden_fees at hotel once you arrive and everything is based_upon availability , so you really dont get what you see ... overall i had a good trip
neutral	but all was clean .
neutral	ordered and paid for goods .
neutral	nothing arrived after over a week .
neutral	received no communication so contacted them .
neutral	didn_'_t have the item in stock after all .
neutral	item finally arrived and was totally_satisfied .
neutral	i just would have liked to have been better informed
neutral	perhaps i should have read these reviews prior to my purchase ?
neutral	!
neutral	quick confirmation of purchase via_email .
neutral	no communication provided during the 00 day delay before item was shipped .
neutral	i was forced to contact customer_support which responded they were delayed in getting shipments out of the warehouse due to the holidays ( not weather related ).
neutral	site -_ul este ok per ansamblu , gama foarte mare de produse ( inclusiv produse și servicii ale partenerilor lor in asa - numitul emag marketplace - asigurări , turism ).
neutral	nu pot sa includ in review prestația lor privitoare la serviciile post - vânzare pentru ca_nu a fost cazul de produse cumpărate care sa se defecteze .
neutral	livrările se fac in general repede - de regula in 00h , excepție făcând perioadele campaniilor gen " black_friday " sau " aniversarea emag " cand poate dura mai mult .
neutral	preturile_sunt la majoritatea produselor semnificativ peste media pieței , dar faptul_ca au livrarea gratuita mai scade din diferență .
neutral	in concluzie , preturile mari m - au determinat sa acord decât 0 stele acestui magazin .
neutral	fitter very efficient and convivial - service let_down by change of date and time of appointment to a later date and with promise of first appointment of the day then fitter arrived mid_morning - a bit disappointing really
neutral	i ordered my truck mirror from partsgeek on 0 - 0 - 00 , but didn_'_t receive it until 0 - 00 - 00 .
neutral	upon_inspection of the box , i noticed that my name and address were left off the shipping box .
neutral	the address on the box was addressed to the post_office in dayton texas .
neutral	not only was my box opened by someone_else , but the shipping invoice was missing .
neutral	i guess the post_office person must have opened the box up got my name from the invky and delivered the box to me .
neutral	way to go uspostal system .
neutral	not sure why my fan belt was substituted with a cheaper one , i ordered a ' gates ' and got a max something or other ...
neutral	i have purchased numerous items from this company and will do so again .
neutral	my most_important feedback to big & tall_direct is : " upgrade you website "!
neutral	i would really like to be able to review my order history for example , so i can re - order the same item .
neutral	there are other examples of modern e_- commerce that you should implement that would make it more desirable to order from you more often .
neutral	product arrived unboxed with no instructions .
neutral	as i know the product and how to install this is ok by me but it '_s more reassuring to get a boxed product complete with intallation instructions etc .
neutral	ordered parts on saturday , august 0 , 0000 .
neutral	checked status on thursday , august 0 , 0000 .
neutral	status said the parts would ship that day .
neutral	received parts on august 00 , 0000 .
neutral	expected to receive parts on friday august 00 , 0000 .
neutral	i based my review on another online parts supplier where i ordered on monday and received the parts on friday of the same week .
neutral	location is nice , around pretty_much everything you need in lamai but the staff is just ridiculously unfriendly .
neutral	when i arrived at the hostel , she called me stupid and poor for no valid reasons and never wanted to help me nor my friends .
neutral	the cleaning staff is very friendly but not the administration staff .
neutral	one of the big advertising you wdo is 0that it stays discrete bu0t0 now0 0this makes me think that the list ofe cu0stomers will be used and is saved so the discrete part is gone ,
neutral	booking a hostel is quick and easy .
neutral	the reviews however are not anonymous from the hostel being rated .
neutral	they know who gave them a rating and that makes providing an honest review difficult .
neutral	hostels have cancelled people because of bad_reviews .
neutral	please make your reviews of hostels completely anonymous from the hostel .
neutral	also your rates could be lower and thus be more competitive to hostelbookers .
neutral	thanks ,
neutral	ra
neutral	my order took a couple more days than_expected wich is not a big_deal .
neutral	what bothered me is it is almost_impossible to find out the contents in the products they sell , if i am not already familiar with what i am purchasing i would have to go to another site to get what im looking for .
neutral	still_waiting
neutral	the powder went all on my nose and forehead .
neutral	although the site is very useful for finding places to stay and even booking , the system sometimes overrides booking and other administrative tasks at the given hostels that you are staying at !
neutral	i don_'_t completely understand how the system works , as i have always been on the client side in these situations , but it can be a pain sometimes when you are in a bind without internet and looking for a place to stay .
neutral	even when you call particular hostels about availability , you can '_t always make a reservation unless you log_into hostelworld . com and find that hostel ( and that particular night ) - for those of us that don_'_t have smartphones attached at the hip , especially when traveling , it can be a deterrent to having a smoother travel experience .
neutral	one other thing to note is that the site isn_'_t clear at all about the weight that each point has in calculating the hostel '_s % based on all of the reviews .
neutral	it seems that sometimes people really do like their stay at places , but 0 may seem to extreme for some aspects and end up throwing in 0 '_s or 0 '_s - however one may accidentally give the hostel a much_lower review than_anticipated .
neutral	i was off work on vacation tore front_end of 00 pontiac down order my parts a - frame bushings and ball_joints and sway_bar bushings i got almost all parts in 0 days but my lower a - frame bushings and my sway_bar bushings took 00 days so i missed my chances to get my car put back together because of your slow shipping your prices are ok but you need to do something about your shipping i will order parts again but not if i need them in a timely_fashion
neutral	had to pick_up car by hertz , which did not have a car in midsize category available .
neutral	the offered us a small suv which did not work for us ( 0 person and 0 suitcases plus 0 carry on bags .
neutral	after about 0 hour wait a older ford mondeo stationwagon was returned and we where told that after it was cleaned we can have it .
neutral	it was a car with 00000 km , no spare_tire but a compressor instead .
neutral	car had a slow air leak in one tire and we had to pump it up twice a week .
neutral	gps failed in every larger city we went to .
neutral	not a good experience !
neutral	!
neutral	when we set this up it was nice but mat estes wish it had coll feature too like the other we have , i do not know if i would of purchased this again .
neutral	i had a different one i was going to order but they talked me into this one
neutral	this is a review of glasses0you , not_necessarily the glasses .
neutral	the glasses and lenses , including tinted were great quality and a good deal !
neutral	i ordered two of the exact_same frame , same color too .
neutral	one pair was regular while one had basic grey tinted lenses .
neutral	i ordered in late november and i didn_'_t receive my order until mid - january .
neutral	about a week_later , i received a nice email_letting_me know they only had on frame left in stock , which i wasn_'_t told on the website or the next_day .
neutral	i responded as i was told it was available in a few other colors .
neutral	then i received an_email one or two_days_later stating there was a confusion and both would be mailed soon .
neutral	i found this email quite confusing but continued on .
neutral	my online order status on the website didn_'_t change from then to early_january and i was beginning to wonder what was going on .
neutral	it still said one pair was processing .
neutral	i emailed mi - friday and received a response on monday , which was okay .
neutral	i was told the status wasn_'_t updated when they were sent and would receive them soon as they had been sent .
neutral	the next_day , i received them and was very happy .
neutral	i do love the glasses , and the service was alright .
neutral	( i am being harsh on the stars due to the frustration .)
neutral	i would possibly recommend glasses0you to my friends / family as other family has used it , gotten good service , and recommended it to me .
neutral	pros ~
neutral	- usually good support
neutral	- ships to countries other than uk
neutral	- great quality frames , lenses
neutral	- friendly support
neutral	cons ~
neutral	- took a bit_longer_than_expected
neutral	- website can be troublesome at first
neutral	the simplicity of adding 0 day to a reservation took over 00_minutes ..... and i was calling from a cell_phone !
neutral	the process was extremely slow .
neutral	i miss the days of making_reservations directly with the property .
neutral	i placed my order on friday and was charged for over night shipping , but did not receive the part until tuesday_morning .
neutral	i expected to receive the part on saturday and was not told that there wasn_'_t any shippments on saturday .
neutral	the order was easy , but could find no invoice , confirmation of payment or note of delivery date , item arrived safe and sound .
neutral	two of the three books i ordered were in the condition displayed .
neutral	one of them was supposed to be " new " but appeared to be used .
neutral	the company is refunding me $_00 .
neutral	i was overall impressed with the price and ease of booking the car_hire .
neutral	however i believe argus need to ensure the companies they use are up to the same standards .
neutral	as when we arrived , we were told that someone would be waiting for us and take us to the car_hire company , which there was not , after ringing several_times about 00_minutes later someone arrived .
neutral	it then took well over an_hour and a half to get the car , as there were several people hiring a car but only one person serving .
neutral	my original order was placed on 00 / 00 / 00 but went missing in the christmas post so .
neutral	i sent an_email to report this on 00 / 00 / 00 but got no response .
neutral	once the company returned to work on 00 / 00 / 00 i contacted them again by phone to explain the situation and to be fair they did replace the order free of charge which eventually arrived on 00 / 00 / 00 .
neutral	there '_s not a lot more i can say about what happened other than as detailed above .
neutral	thank_you .
neutral	good prices on parts but impossible to talk to someone .
neutral	this is ok unless you have a problem .
neutral	they take 0 to 0 days to answer a question via_email .
neutral	sometimes it takes several emails to resolve an issue so a week can go by before a problem is resolved .
neutral	i received a defective_part and was looking at 0_weeks to get a new part ( 0 week to get them to issue an_rma , 0 week to return the part and 0 week to get the replacement ).
neutral	this on top of the 0 week to get the part in the first place means that a month could go by .
neutral	in my case this was too_long so i opted to have the part repaired locally at my cost .
neutral	after i paid to have the part installed , removed , repaired and re - installed , this turned_out to be a very expensive part .
neutral	looking for a boyfriend .
neutral	this shipment arrived 0 days earlier_than_expected , however the box was crushed and so were the filters .
neutral	on one of them , the cardboard frame was not sealed properly .
neutral	i will try to use them , but i think you should structure the box stronger
neutral	i tried to buy your demin jacked in the stores but you didn_'_t have my size .
neutral	by the way , i do not wear size xxl and sizing your clothes this way is insulting .
neutral	but regardless , you did not have my size and the store could not get it .
neutral	in fact , i called most of the stores on the west_coast and my of your employees told me that that item is only available on line .
neutral	most people were rude .
neutral	finally , i went on line and purchased .
neutral	i love the item and the website was so much_easier of an experience in every way .
neutral	like the site but too many ads .
neutral	our order was not delivered when expected .
neutral	when we called , it turned_out that our order wasn_'_t on one of comms_express '_s systems but was on another .
neutral	they sorted the problem out quite swiftly .
neutral	no hand towels & bath towels were stained , carpet was stained , no do not disturbe sign for door & latch on door for security was broken & eeww matress had big old blood stains .
neutral	i only got part of the shipment and instead of shipping out the remainder of shipment i was instructed i had to return the whole shipment and start the process all over again .
neutral	i got the brake_pads ok just not the shims .
neutral	so i chose to install the brake_pads anyway because i have made time in my schedule to do so and just got the shims locally .
neutral	i probably would not do_business again even thought partsgeek had the best posted prices .
neutral	the reservation process went quickly but i was very disappointed to find out that the reservation could not be changed , cancelled or refunded .
neutral	site was very unclear about this and while i am_hopeful we will not have to change the hotel reservations , something could come up and you should be able to cancel .
neutral	not happy !
neutral	you sent me a part that was not in any correlation to what i ordered or you posted per website .
neutral	rick of your marlton office was kind enough to confirm this with timkin site and said that he will have a return postage paid info sent to me .
neutral	that was wed_morning and still_waiting for it !
neutral	frank
neutral	as i said in the opinion , i got through the whole_process of of getting the key .
neutral	i was excited to activate in steam until i got the message that the key is already in use .
neutral	is this a legit site ?
neutral	gak messed_up my order but i will_definitely order again .
neutral	gak sent the wrong item instead of my bass_amp , i rang up and they said they was out of stock so i got a different bass_amp for the same price .
neutral	even_though i had to wait a few_days and kept having to ring up which made me distrust them because they didn_'_t ring up to say it was out of stock when everything got sorted_out i decided i could trust them .
neutral	the reason trust is so important for me is i '_m left_handed and buying basses is hard where i live so i hope in the future when i do order a bass or anything for that matter they won_'_t send the wrong thing so i have to wait and wonder_if they did it on purpose or that they just messed_up which happens sometimes .
neutral	also the mostly positive_reviews gives me piece of mind when ordering for this website .
neutral	two post delivery messages sent no response
neutral	you sent two wiper_blades and one had an adapter and one did not .
neutral	the adapter did not fit on the wiper_blade arm of the car .
neutral	i had been to four places prior to you guys and they all did not work either .
neutral	i had to return the item .
neutral	i had to get it at the dealer .
neutral	we are very happy with the product and price , however we feel you are taking_advantage of us on the shipping_costs - this is quite obvious , so in the future we will be forced to shop around i dont_know prices are decent i mean i saved about 00 $ on my item aftershipping .
neutral	but that is only becuase i didnt take 0nd day shipping like company offfers in the include price of the item
neutral	purchased 0 boxes epson fine art paper listed as having free shipping in usa .
neutral	when i went to check out there was no provision for selecting free shipping and had to pay .
neutral	ordered two knives : extrema ratio bayonet and fox ti divers knife - the bayonet wasn_'_t !
neutral	it was the civilian version and marked quite clearly ????
neutral	ah well , service was good even if the knife wasn_'_t exactly_what i wanted and they did offer either a full_refund - i opted for the difference in price which i was promised will be returned immediately - ish ( bank system etc_.)
neutral	still disappointed that i don_'_t have the knife i ordered but i can wait_until these are in stock and i will order more from hh .
neutral	i wish that i could have viewed the different weights and sizes and bands for each type of exercise piece .
neutral	instead i could only see the one size that they wanted to showcase .
neutral	to long to rec ' v fund '_s it '_s not 0hr as you say .
neutral	i could not read one of the pins i did not complain because it was only $_00 but i was disappointed
neutral	i was able to get a great deal on my flights .
neutral	i accidently made my reservation using a single use travelocity account , rather_than my regular account ( an oversight on my part ).
neutral	due to travelocity policy , they are not able to combine this trip with my regular account information , which from an administrative perspective is disappointing .
neutral	why a five dollar fee for the use of your credit_card ?
neutral	is the business so competitive that you can '_t provide the total price in your rate .
neutral	your shuttle drivers on both to and from the airport seemed to have just eaten a lemon .
neutral	to me they tell more about the company than the people that greet you .
neutral	this looks_like a 0nd_class website
neutral	seamless is far better
neutral	hertz near the vatican , met the requirment for a standard size automobile with a opel stationwagon -- that was damaged on three sides -- i insured that the vehicle damage was documented and as a result there was no problem turning it in at the airport 0 days_later .
neutral	we waited for at_least 00_minutes to get the automobile cleaned_up -- there was no_explanation for providing the damaged car -- this is the second time i have received a damaged car from auto_europe -- previously i received a car with a damage windshield in paris .
neutral	the car was functional .
neutral	it acted_like it needed a good tune up -- third gear lacked any real acceleration like one would expect from a german built automobile .
neutral	i rate this experience as marginally satisfactory .
neutral	service was slow and it seemed that the prescription was lost for a while
neutral	autoeurope was fine , but avis did not have the booking in the system with price and hence tried to charge me extra .
neutral	i still_await the final_bill .
neutral	used takeaway . com for the first time and , up to a point , it worked just fine - the right food arrived at the right time , and we received an_email_confirming we had paid , online .
neutral	then the problem started - the delivery guy said we hadn_'_t paid them and , over the phone , his_boss denied having any arrangement for payment online and to bring the food back if we wouldn_'_t pay up again .
neutral	in the end we paid , twice , and during the doorstep debate , the food all got cold .
neutral	we will pursue getting our money back , but can only say it '_s been an unsatisfactory service , for us .
neutral	great product as usual , no free_goodies that were promised to be delivered if you ordered on a special day .
neutral	after sales email response was a kind of tough_luck , who_cares attitude !
neutral	would have been 0_stars had the customer service been up to scratch !
neutral	bookit . com made it easy to find the right hotel in the right place for the right price .
neutral	i '_ve bought three suits now from tailor0less .
neutral	they have all been good quality , but even through the same measurements stored online are being used for the same cut of suits the sizing seems to be varied .
neutral	i joined the website , and was brought here by a website that advertised your games and i was a steam section of the website , purchased pro evolution soccer 0000 but i got a cd - key not a steam game which section i was in , also then i saw in small_print please download this game by a torrent , since my isp blocks torrent websites how is that possible and since i got the cd - key why would i want a cd - key without a disk or anything to even play it it '_s basically paying for a bunch and numbers and letter
neutral	i probably would never recommend them to anyone ever again .
neutral	good product range .
neutral	have always opted for next_day delivery and never had a problem except my last order where they shipped my supplements late and did not inform_me about the delay .
neutral	when i wrote to them to ask for a refund of my next_day delivery charge , i did not receive any response till date , which is kind of annoying .
neutral	it is because of that i give them 0_stars for customer service even_though their product range is great
neutral	bummed that i paid_extra for faster shipping then found out that you only ship mon - wed .
neutral	i would not have paid_extra for faster shipping if i would have known
neutral	i ordered klaires vit d drops ( 000 doses ) 00 days ago and was shipped may 0000 dated product
neutral	i called and a pickup was made and assured that the second bottle would be better dated product
neutral	the same date was shipped
neutral	my stay in italy was fabulous !
neutral	great accommodations , food , people , loved my vacation .
neutral	the flight back home was another story .
neutral	the international fight with brussels air was good , no_complaints but my connecting_flight from chicago to santa ana aboard united was a nightmare .
neutral	after being up and about for over 00_hours due to my international flight , united then stuck me in the very last row up against the back wall of the aircraft which by the way prohibits you entirely from reclining your chair even an inch !
neutral	i was also in the middle seat between two large individuals .
neutral	this seat was excruciatingly uncomfortable .
neutral	i asked my flight attendant if he could_possibly find me another seat and explained to him that i had been up for over 00_hours and he just said it was a crowed flight today and just walked away !
neutral	because the seat was so uncomfortable i stood next to the bathrooms for the last 0 hours of the flight !
neutral	with absolutely no regard from the flight attendants .
neutral	good job united !
neutral	we had no_problems giving in our car and were quite impressed with the efficiency , however there was some miscommunication when it came to pick_up and we were left waiting for a while in the car_park for our car to be brought back .
neutral	staff were polite but clearer instructions need to be given for pick ups .
neutral	this is great website and i user it very often .
neutral	but , i '_ll ask for a new feature - for a specific date search , you should have a rss feeds or email feeds for flight offers for a specific travel segment .
neutral	example helsinki - ny - 00 dec - 00 jan return flight - to have this search and keep sending email on regular interval , if there is price change or new offer .
neutral	as of now , i can save only specific offer only - which is not very much useful .
neutral	the item registered for free_expedited_shipping and when i went to check out it charged me and didn_'_t expedite it .
neutral	the sign_up process was onerous .
neutral	took way too_long , too many pages , signatures , initials , etc .
neutral	fire your lawyers !
neutral	i can '_t believe you don_'_t have a map to give a new customer !
neutral	a simple post card - sized aerial view with location of my unit circled and the youarehere of the office !
neutral	c ' mon , people .
neutral	get smart .
neutral	this is stupid .
neutral	unit should be swept out when old tenant leaves .
neutral	mine was a mess of dust and grime .
neutral	had to break down some boxes and cover the floor !
neutral	lame welcome !
neutral	i havent gotten the products yet so i cant talk about that .
neutral	i did pay for 0 day shipping , its a week_later and im still_waiting .
neutral	i probably did not read the details carefully enough when buying the cartiridges , but i didn_'_t realise these were not genuine_epson cartridges , which causes the pop ups on the computer and printer , but not a major problem .
neutral	the first black_cartridge that i got i will probably have to return as it did not print and no amount of nozzle or head cleaning got it going , so quality was not top_notch .
neutral	the second cartridge appears to be fine .
neutral	these are my first epson cartidges ( apart_from the ones which arrived with the printer ), and i know it '_s pretty obvious what to do , but instructions would have helped .
neutral	good price for the bundle though .
neutral	i purchased online ticket and things were okay .
neutral	i have not flown with the ticket yet .
neutral	ordered a freesat recorder , parcel arrived , they ' d sent wrong one !
neutral	phoned up , they apologised and said they ' d send courier to collect wrong one and send the right one once they ' d received the wrong one back .
neutral	it did get sorted fairly quickly , but it would be nice if they checked stuff before packing it for despatch !
neutral	ordered some roofing tingles at a fair price which were delivered when they said they would .
neutral	however the corners of a couple of the packs had been damaged by what i can only presume to be mis_- handling of the packs .
neutral	instead of having reasonably square corners they were rounded which looks naff .
neutral	couldnt be arsed to complain at the time , had to get the job_done .
neutral	this meant a lot of cutting and carving .
neutral	parts_geek has some of the things i look for and the prices are so - so , but not the highest .
neutral	most all on line parts_houses usually in my opinion do not offer the harder to find items as these items do not generate sales voumn ( in my opinion ).
neutral	aloha dd
neutral	please see contact form regarding : order #_0000000 ( case #: dhnp0ie00f )
neutral	filled_out a review to get 00 dollars off .
neutral	not until afterwards does it say you have to spend 000_dollars .
neutral	( misleading )
neutral	then , the shipping was 0x the core_return , so i did not mail it back . i wonder_if that is what you count on , so you get more for the part .
neutral	had 0htc desire sent to enviro_phone although both phones were in protective cases all the time we owned them 0was valued at £ 00other £_00 was absolutely nothing wrong with it when it was sent although u paid more than shops when i sell my iphone_0s will be using another online co
neutral	with " distance_selling " ( for the consumer ) it can be fraught with problems and purchase of a roland gr00 from their website for £_000 . 00 recently resulted_in the wrong coloured item being shipped .
neutral	fortunately i had taken a " screen_shot " of the item from my computer for record purposes and was rather concerned when checking their website again , to make_sure i had not made a mistake , found they had removed the item entirely which made me somewhat suspicious , however , their web sales_team eventually sent the desired item after waiting for stock to arrive and collected the incorrect item at the same time .
neutral	there has never been any intimation of compensation for my inconvenience considering i had to abort an arranged party gig causing a great deal of inconvenience to my client and as a result of this i will source my future musical_equipment purchases elsewhere .
neutral	i have used partsgeek several_times very satisfactorily in the past and have always received timely deliveries ... until now .
neutral	i would have had to wait nearly 0_weeks for 0 of 0 parts ordered on the same order but wasn_'_t given this info up front .
neutral	in fact i only found out the day after i received the first part which came in 0 days .
neutral	having to wait that long for a <$ 00 part was not what i expected .
neutral	i had to buy the part locally to put my daughter '_s car back together in a timely_manner making the part total_cost even higher .
neutral	i will now need to consider other options before using partsgeek in the future .
neutral	everything was going great until confirmation submission when i received an unidentified error_message to contact customer service .
neutral	the service rep was very courteous and helpful and did affirm that my reservation request did indeed go through .
neutral	later the same evening i got confirmation that my room had been booked as requested .
neutral	could have been 0_stars but not this time .
neutral	protein is what it is .
neutral	disappointed with customer service though because purchase was advertised with a free_sample , which wasn_'_t included within the package .
neutral	i asked if they could send it separately and was told no - only offered more free_samples if i make another purchase ...... i '_ve got 0 . 0kg to get through before i need to make another purchase so hey ho .
neutral	poor but not worth arguing about .
neutral	i was looking for a solution to the backdraft problem on my downdraft cooktop .
neutral	searching ecomfort was easy , purchasing was easy , the price was great and no shipping charge !.
neutral	so - high marks on the service .
neutral	the first product shipped had some quality issues , so i have returned it and ordered another .
neutral	the return process was also easy !
neutral	looking_forward to receiving the replacement as quickly as the original .
neutral	price was good but the shipping time was horrible .
neutral	i will spend a little more somewhere_else to get the product faster
neutral	i bought a digicode keypad but have not been able to program it to my garage_door .
neutral	i sent an_email to northshore stating my problem and included pictures of my garage_door_opener .
neutral	0 days and still no response .
neutral	poor support after the sale .
neutral	plants arrived in good shape - but was puzzled that the one plant was taggged with a home_depot label .
neutral	who am i reall y buying from ?
neutral	i made a reservation through travelocity for a weekend get - away with my wife .
neutral	when we got to the hotel they had no record of any reservation for us .
neutral	fortunately i had output with a confirmation number on it .
neutral	i have no_idea where the problem was but it made for a few_minutes of tension wondering_whether we ' d be able to stay at our intended location .
neutral	the hotel manager resolved everything .
neutral	i found the items i needed using google_search so adding it to the cart was pretty easy .
neutral	no paypal option so you have to enter in your info to pay .
neutral	i browsed around the website and became a little frustrated that the site would not remember the vehicle information .
neutral	every time i changed areas i had to enter my vehicle again .
neutral	if the website only asked you one time for your vehicle it would be nice .
neutral	the design is clean and fairly simple .
neutral	you require more than you have coming from a repeat paying customer .
neutral	i will make a note in my files that purchasing product from your company requires declining an unrequested and unwanted upsell and an experience expose ' wasting my valuable time .
neutral	that time will add $_00 . 00 to the calcualted cost of your product against the pricing from your competitors .
neutral	i hope my expose ' has fullfilled the required minimum to remain a payng customer in good standing .
neutral	all three items were listed as " shipped " under same tracking_number but were not .

neutral	but the inner and outer pieces will not snap together .
neutral	now what ?
neutral	myprotein offers a good service , but choose anything other than yodel for shipping .
neutral	my last order was lost 0 week_ago and i '_m still_waiting for re - shippment or my money back :(
neutral	i think your website is difficult to work with .
neutral	it is slow .
neutral	i changed the amount of product i ordered , i clicked the update button and nothing happened .
neutral	it was very annoying .
neutral	i still do not understand your different options fir getting discounts .
neutral	i think there is a monthly_fee .
neutral	i think the person_who writes the copy is not a good write .
neutral	you need a professional to write these things so even stupid people can understand it .
neutral	i didn_'_t take these options because i was not entirely certain what they were .
neutral	since i order occasionally i thought that it did not make_sense for me to pay some kind of monthly_fee to secure a discount .
neutral	you might consider a discount program that makes_sense for the occasional purchaser ..
neutral	london taxi drivers could teach insurance agents a thing or too .
neutral	they are the epitome of professionalism , their cabs are proudly clean , they are polite to their customers , but above all they are trained to pass a test called the knowledge so they know london inside out , no guessing , no asking the customer , they know where to go .
neutral	ask a multitrip advisor for a list of public health clinics on magaluf when your son has an injury and has called on a friend '_s phone so you ' re not sure how serious or not it is , and you '_ll be told , politely , that there are many and you will no_doubt find them online .
neutral	at that moment you wish you were in a london cab in magaluf itself and that he was taking you there with the knowledge .
neutral	a pity there are no london cabbies in magaluf .
neutral	delivery arrived for next door , none for me .
neutral	however the driver and his dispatcher organised a reshuffle of his deliveries and sorted me out .
neutral	my delivery was to be 0 days_later
neutral	i placed a multi item order in part because of positives i had read about them .
neutral	the first delivery received contained 0 errors - an incorrect gasket and missing spark_plugs .
neutral	i emailed back about this .
neutral	i was to return the pump and gasket for credit which i did .
neutral	i got the credit for that .
neutral	fine !
neutral	the other items came in fine and were correct .
neutral	but , even_though i was told that they would refund the spark_plugs which i did not receive , they will not credit or communicate with me about it .
neutral	weeks have passed and i am through with them .
neutral	it was so simple to correct but they would not do it .
neutral	buyer_beware !
neutral	ordered on 00rd it '_s now the 0nd and still no order !
neutral	ups would have had it here last_week ( guessing from past experience )
neutral	fedex sux !
neutral	partsgeek has a wide inventory on parts with great prices , the only problem is when you order a part and you get the wrong one , you pay for shipping to receive the part and once you have to send it back you will have to pay for the shipping again so you will end up paying shipping twice !
neutral	i am satisfied with the products they have but the delivery time is toooo long .
neutral	ordered all my parts at same time but 0 piece took over 0_weeks to get here delaying an important repair .
neutral	all were shipped on same day .
neutral	wish i would of had a choice on shipping .
neutral	other 0 parts were here in 0 days .
neutral	saved a lot of money on parts so i would recommend to others but with caution
neutral	sorry to only give 0_stars but the delivery was slow at best , if you could find a btter courier that can get the stuff out quicker for same price you would be keeping us all real happy , and for my part i would order more stuff from you
neutral	varen er fin .
neutral	men størrelsen blev forkert : 0 - 0 år ( 000 - 000 )
neutral	lidt bøvlet at sende retur ( lægge penge ud / få penge retur ) ekstra forsendelsesomkostning til følge .
neutral	får bare bukserne selv syet ind_og lagt op .
neutral	blev så 000 ,- ekstra !
neutral	!
neutral	just before_christmas , i had ordered tennis_shoes for my son , who required new shoes in preparation for tournaments winter tournaments .
neutral	during 0nd week of this month i had not received the package , and on enquiring i discovered that the pair of tennis_shoes was delivered to an_unknown address some distance away from my residential address , at done the week before .
neutral	this is despite leaving a note for package to be left with my neigbours , in the event that nobody was at home .
neutral	at first , it was unclear where the package had been delivered , as i was told it had been delivered to either of my neigbours .
neutral	no note was left at my home to advise of the delivery .
neutral	i requested for another pair to be sent to the correct address .
neutral	this is dissapointing , because i had raised my son '_s expectation and meant that he continued wearing a worn - out pair of shoes .
neutral	in addition , my details had been issued to a stranger , with no effort to correct the mistake .
neutral	i have not received any reconpense for this silly mistake , even_though i regularly order sports wear and equipment for my family of 0 .
neutral	i order a lot of items on line and your pricing for shipping seems to be extremely high .
neutral	while the booking was generally easy , there are some confusing parts , and i had to go through some steps twice , especially for air travel .
neutral	the process could be made much clearer .
neutral	although i answered all questions correctly , indicating that my grandson is a 00 - year_old minor , he was listed as an adult on the final page .
neutral	because of having to re - enter some things twice , the final page was addressed to my daughter as if she had done the booking instead of to me .
neutral	i will emphasize that neither of these glitches caused us any_problems , but the site needs to be cleaned_up a bit .
neutral	our prepaid vehicle was ready as_promised .
neutral	the car was in good condition and we had no difficulties with it for the 00 day rental .
neutral	the only_negative was the office in florence .
neutral	there were long , slow lines for check - in / pick - up .
neutral	the bathroom was unavailable to clients even_though many were standing around for long_periods of time waiting to get their car .
neutral	first off , i am happy with square_trade and i recommend them to everyone .
neutral	i have several warranties with them .
neutral	but after filing a recent claim , they '_ve been emailing me daily requesting that i write this review .
neutral	at first i ignored the emails figuring they would stop but , alas , no nice .
neutral	so i '_m forced to write this and i hope they '_ll stop pestering me now .
neutral	we '_ll see .
neutral	otherwise , a great and pleasant service .
neutral	driver and guide were entertaining and full of info .
neutral	dover cliffs was a waste .
neutral	only got to about 0 mile from it .
neutral	not good if you wanted to be really close , same goes for dover castle .
neutral	leeds castle was spectacular but don_'_t expect to get in with the 00 gbp rate .
neutral	you will be paying more to enter and actually see the castle .
neutral	i compared several sites and the prices and this site are the best ones , but i missed more offers or promotions , also i tried to contact customer service and had no answer and the next nay delivery came 0 days_later .
neutral	simultaneously i ordered some stuff from cheapsupplements . co . uk and they answer to my query the same day and delivery came next_day so i must_say this gonna be my srcond best choice
neutral	. good prices but adding a transaction fee is very annoying
neutral	after 0_weeks of correspondence i was finally forced to go without one item i really wanted to purchase and for another , pick my 0th preference .
neutral	upon my request , internetgiftstore promptly refunded my delivery charge and the products arrived quickly and as_described .
neutral	this is part of the service was good and i '_m sure most the fun and interesting products on the website are available .
neutral	it was just a shame that it took 0_weeks for them to tell me that my first , second and 0rd choices of a couple of the products advertised on their website were actually unavailable .
neutral	glasses are good should have complained about tint
neutral	took to long for them to mail out my gift_cards .
neutral	try to search for some promo_codes before making a purchase because they ' re always hidden away or get announced after you buy something .
neutral	got a text saying that what i ordered would be delivered in a time_slot on friday_afternoon .
neutral	however , the parcel never turned_up so i did not want to go out in case i missed it .
neutral	so waited til 0pm then gave up .
neutral	got a text sat_morning saying it would be delivered later that morning which it was , it was just frustrating that i waited in friday_afternoon for it to turn up .
neutral	otherwise , happy with what i purchased .
neutral	the product itself was good , and cheap , delivery was good , everything was fine and acceptable .
neutral	as you would expect .
neutral	what i don_'_t accept and hold a huge objection to was the enormous ' sale countdown ' timer ticking_away to pressurise me into buying before the sale ended at midnight that day .
neutral	only to find 0_weeks_later that the sale is still on !!
neutral	now i feel conned , and that is utterly unacceptable .
neutral	as a customer of bookbyte for two semesters , i think that overall , it is " so - so " company .
neutral	the prices are competitive ( not always the cheapest ), customer service is excellent and the shipping is fast .
neutral	however , i have three gripes : firstly , i don_'_t like that bookbyte advertises a price with a discount included that the student will receive at the end of the rental period when returned .
neutral	secondly , there are no 00 day rentals ( ideal for summer semesters ) like on other textbook sites .
neutral	lastly , my previous two books arrived in a non_- reusable package ( the first book came in a bookbyte box , which i used to return the two books that i rented last semester ).
neutral	in summation , bookbyte is " just okay " and if i see the book cheaper at another website , i would go with the cheaper price .
neutral	there is no incentive to retain my loyalty as a customer .
neutral	don_'_t think much of your system .
neutral	we had to pay extra for a shorter delivery time - because oil now so expensive we were nearly out before we had saved enough to re - order 000_litres this was delivered promptly by [_link ] so we have no complaint with them .
neutral	however , think excluding us from so - called " group_savings " because we had to opt for a shorter delivery time is unfair .
neutral	although to be honest your " group_savings " has saved us exactly 00 pence over the last 0 years !
neutral	( lol !)
neutral	minimum order of 000_litres is unrealistic when prices are so high , - you should offer a " top up " system until ( if ever ) prices become less extortionate .
neutral	the minimum monthly amount you will accept into your " savings account " scheme is also too high .
neutral	this should be more flexible on the basis that " every little helps
neutral	website should indicate whether poster is in stock .
neutral	payment required at checkout , order arrives with invoice but no_explanation as to why one item has not been delivered .
neutral	have to phone to arrange refund .
neutral	unsatisfactory .
neutral	i ordered the envelop and then on the same day found some similar for half the price .
neutral	i asked if i could cancel my order ( customer_services very good ) however , it was too_late and my order was already dispatched .
neutral	although in this instance that was unfortunate , the fact that the items were dispatched and delivered so quickly showed excellent service .
neutral	after a long winter that continues ... it would be nice if the facility did anything at all to move some of the snow so people can get in their units .
neutral	for what this place costs , i am unimpressed .
neutral	vet needed a prescription for part of the order .
neutral	my vet wouldnt sign on .
neutral	cancelled that scrip .
neutral	that was on friday .
neutral	stated rest of order would be shipped .
neutral	paid for two day shipping .
neutral	today is thursday and still no order .
neutral	not happy .
neutral	i order a monroe front strut for my hyundai 0000 part # 000 -_00000000 and they sent me #_00000 turn out to be a rear_strut . and then my check out sheet has the right # an price . my order is 00 -_00000000 dated 00 - 00 - 00 for $_000 . 00
neutral	i ordered a 0 rose beucay for girlfriend on 0 month anniversary and while it did show up on the correct day , there were only 0 roses .
neutral	i think the products from natural_sapphire company are great and their prices are competitive with anyone online .
neutral	the only reason for 0_stars was due to the after purchase treatment .
neutral	i needed to get the stone on saturday , so i put that in when i purchased .
neutral	i also called their shipping department and left a voice_mail to confirm they saw it .
neutral	i never received a follow_up phone_call , even after calling a second time and leaving a voice_mail .
neutral	i finally called and talked with a sales_person to confirm they had that information .
neutral	to add to that , i knew that they could do saturday delivery , but it wasn_'_t spelled out online that it would cost more .
neutral	when i talked with the sales_person they mentioned that it was going to be another $_00 for that option .
neutral	i never received any notification of that additional_charge ; i only saw the final_bill with that added .
neutral	other than that i '_m more than happy with the stone i received .
neutral	you buy something that you want but it doent fit , then they don_'_t have anymore that will fit you .
neutral	purchased round_trip flight to kansas_city on 0 / 00 on 0 / 0 the price had dropped over $_000 for two round_trip tickets , but travelocitys policy is that they will only match the lower price for 00_hours even_though the lower price was listed on their web_site .
neutral	if i were to rate merlin_cycles only on their shipping and customer service , would rate them 0_stars .
neutral	their product description is much to be desired .
neutral	in particular , their shimano products are oem purchased in bulk .
neutral	does not include the product '_s retail packaging .
neutral	you receive the item in transparent plastic covers .
neutral	this fact is never mentioned on their website either under faqs or the product description page .
neutral	emailed cs upon_receipt of my order expressing my displeasure .
neutral	was told to be able to offer products cheaply , merlin_cycles purchases the items in bulk .
neutral	was offered the possibility of a return if i shipped the items back on my dime .
neutral	wasn_'_t worth the effort considering i live in the usa .
neutral	i don_'_t think i would order or recommend this store .
neutral	unless they update their product description to indicate which item is oem and which is the actual retail product .
neutral	always heard good things about parts_geek .
neutral	jan00 ordered radiator .
neutral	part shipped fex , then usps .
neutral	received the wrong radiator , and notified parts_geek .
neutral	their 000 number is almost valueless after 00 min i gave up .
neutral	sent emails .
neutral	received a reply saying will look into it .
neutral	another e_-_mail saying perhaps i will not have to pay for item and a refund perhaps due after 0 - 0 days from decision .
neutral	i requested they mail me a parts return slip , as do not have a printer .
neutral	still_waiting and i still need a radiator .
neutral	generally okay ; good products but slow to refund after i ordered the wrong item .
neutral	i love the convenience , ease of use , and price of your service .
neutral	i would have had no_complaints but i purchased a 00_lb bag of dog_food and two bags of treats .
neutral	they were all packaged in one box and of course the treats were on the bottom so they were pretty smashed .
neutral	now instead of dog biscuits i have mostly dog crumbs .
neutral	one part came quickly .
neutral	the other was 0 days ( 0 business days )
neutral	been using pcgamesupply for many months - recent system changes have introduced paltry purchase limits .
neutral	question to support resulted_in a generic disappointing response that showed zero support
neutral	apparently " computer said no " is offered as a reason expected to be acceptable .
neutral	too often poor system design , poor specification , poor testing and poor service .... computer said no - utterly brainless
neutral	it was exactly_what i wanted , delivered fairly fast .
neutral	however when i looked around on the internet and in my local_pet_store i found the same product 00_% cheaper not even mentioning the delivery charge !!
neutral	won_'_t be buying again from them i '_m afraid .
neutral	i only buy online if it is cheaper .
neutral	otherwise there is no point .
neutral	useful , but i wouldn_'_t keep too much money in your account .
neutral	they have crazy rules where they can freeze your account for 00 days any time they want .
neutral	it happened to me once .
neutral	arranging delivery was inflexible even_though the website indicates flexibility .
neutral	had to agree to certain day of certain week or wait for the next slot which they couldn_'_t advise when it would be and could be weeks_later .
neutral	rude on phone when suggested this was not the flexibility they indicated on their website .
neutral	bed was of ok quality but definitely not great .
neutral	on a good note the delivery men were very friendly and efficient .
neutral	price and shipping were satisfactory , however one of the shaving_cream products i ordered , was old and dried up .
neutral	couldn_'_t even squeeze it out of the tube .
neutral	it was like it had been opened up and never closed .
neutral	at first i thought it was just a little dried up piece that was blocking the hole .
neutral	i forced a little out and still had trouble .
neutral	tried sticking a toothpick in to see how far it went , then gave up .
neutral	in all fairness , i did not contact west_coast , because i didn_'_t think it was worth the trouble for one tube , nonetheless , i was disappointed
neutral	this bus_tour definitely hits all the major stops .
neutral	just had a really hard time catching one at any stop we made .
neutral	nearly_£ 0000 of wheels got lost somewhere between the warehouse and the courier .
neutral	took nearly a week to sort out , not sure if the final delivery was the ones that were originally sent or a new pair .
neutral	staff were reassuring every time i rang which was sometimes twice a day .
neutral	i buy ukash from this site .
neutral	i think it takes too_long to get the voucher numbers .
neutral	trying to place an order proved difficult as the computer kept defaulting to uk jersey , the only way to stop it was to enter the county on the address , it doesn_'_t ask for one
neutral	compared to seamless , delivery . com is harder to use ( e . g .
neutral	can '_t sort by price bracket ), harder to communicate to ( getting delivery . com staff on phone is difficult ), and in general has less range , higher prices , and less promotions .
neutral	have never been to storage site where the dumpster was unlocked .
neutral	i was told initially that it was available to renters ... subsequent to that ( by another agent ) i was told that the dumpster was not for the renters .
neutral	a little_confused ????
neutral	?
neutral	i just purchased a winter_cover and double water bsgs for our pool .
neutral	on filling the water bags there were 00 of them on 0 of them one seam on each of them were defected and leaked so if i was amerimerc i would check out who i was contracting from .
neutral	despite the excellent response and delivery time i was slightly dissapointed to find one of the shirts i received was slightly marked / soiled .
neutral	it took a week longer to get my parts than_expected unbenounced to me my 0 parts were coming in 0 shipments and this all caused me to miss my vehicle registration renewal because i couldnt pass the smog test on the pulse side the parts i received are oem and the best price i could find so if your in no hurry buy from parts_geek
neutral	i live the glasses but it took almost a month and a half to get them .
neutral	i bought two frame sizes to test feel .
neutral	one worked well .
neutral	i returned the other and asked that i get a second_pair of the size that worked .
neutral	i also asked that the second frames be sent to my address in florida -- highlighted in brite yellow .
neutral	but the frames were sent to my place in california where i will not return for several months .
neutral	so not a perfect transaction .
neutral	the return rma was not instant sent in 00 - 00_hrs .
neutral	part was delivered quickly but i recieved the wrong part i order the right side door_handle but recieved the left ?
neutral	big_bus_tours finish around 0 - 0pm .
neutral	we didn_'_t realise this so missed the bus on day 0 !
neutral	day 0 we caught the bus at tower_bridge just after 0pm .
neutral	the ( female ) guide was obviously bored and not interested in explaining much about what we were seeing , merely going through the motions .
neutral	we left the bus at victoria , had a coffee and caught another bus with an excellent guide through belgravia , and back to green_park .
neutral	completely different and better experience and worth the cost if we ' d had this guy all the tour .
neutral	the service was excellent .
neutral	came to pick me up within a reasonable time ... my car was waiting for me .
neutral	my complaint is that i wanted to use a groupon certificate for this service .
neutral	i received a receipt saying that my reservation was accepted for the dates i selected and i paid for the groupon plus an_additional $_00 tax .
neutral	when i got to the facility they said my dates were " blackout dates " and i would have to pay the full_amount .
neutral	check out the groupon site ... it is well hidden that there are blackout dates , you have to click on something at the very bottom .
neutral	my reservation should not have been accepted .
neutral	groupon gave_me credit but i am out the $_00 tax i paid to the facility .
neutral	i had origionaly ordered a part for my bmw i ordered the passenger_side grill piece in all chrome ..
neutral	when i had recived the part 0 days_later after a guarenteed date arrival it was wrong .
neutral	it was the wrong color .
neutral	im not dissapointed cause honestly it looks great with the car color .
neutral	but still its not whatni had ordered .
neutral	parts are easy to find but correcting a mistake was impossible . there was no way to be sure that an order had been placed untill the next_day . returns only after your order has_been recei , thenyou may request an authorization_number to return the item which i received after about 00_hours . very cumbersome , it would have been nice to correct my mistake by phone or e_mail . paying the shipping_charges both_ways was a painful experience .
neutral	my first try was simply terrific -- with all work done very fast , accurate , and inexpensive .
neutral	the second try was also fast and inexpensive but the accuracy was terrible , requiring a lot of work from me to fix .
neutral	i suspect that the cause of the inaccuracy was partly my fault -- for electing the less_expensive , rougher transcription ( which was exactly as hoped for the first round ) and submitting one , longer recording rather_than a series of short ones .
neutral	obviously the length of the recording made a difference , because the transcription got worse and worse as the minutes past .
neutral	there we 000 " inaudible " sections ( which i found quite audible ) in less_than 00_minutes , with about half of them in the last quarter of the recording .
neutral	.
neutral	. signaling fatigue or haste to me , as much as anything .
neutral	next time , i '_ll try breaking up the recording into smaller pieces and see if i get back to the quality nof the first try
neutral	items were not packaged well and arrived broken .
neutral	however rma process was simple .
neutral	ebay is an awesome place to find cheap , rare , and otherwise collectible items .
neutral	you can find virtually anything you can imagine on there .
neutral	the problem with ebay is that the selling community is inept .
neutral	if someone decides not to ship your item , prepare for a battle to get your money back .
neutral	on the flip side , if you ' re a seller , ebay treats you awfully .
neutral	you sell an item , wait 0_weeks for the money to become available because ebay wants to verify that your item shipped ( even_though the guy received it a week_ago ), then and only then do they decide to slice 00_% of the money off the top for themselves .
neutral	as if holding onto it for a month wasn_'_t enough ?
neutral	and let '_s not forget after listing 00 items you have to start paying per listing ?
neutral	ebay would be awesome if the company wasn_'_t full of greed .
neutral	great deals .
neutral	sometimes very fast .
neutral	.
neutral	too bad they don_'_t answer emails or phone_calls for advise .
neutral	i feel onnit .
neutral	i want to make more money to buy more onnit products .
neutral	i am at warrior level status right now , and i know i will exceed legend level in my life time .
neutral	i like the loyalty_program , and look_forward to earning my next achievement patch .
neutral	i think aubrey is awesome .
neutral	i can see his vision supported throughout the company .
neutral	that being said , here '_s my full critique : the website rocks !
neutral	it '_s interactive , attractive , easy and fun !
neutral	i wish there was digital mapping for the howler monkey kb , and the zombies , but i '_m just being picky .
neutral	otherwise the kb '_s are great , i like the pood measurement in addition to the poundage , so pood - haters can suck it .
neutral	: p i wish the supplement prices were lower , but that '_s on me .
neutral	i order stuff on line all the time , and shipments from onnit seem to be consistently slower_than other shippers .
neutral	i '_m not sure why that is , but that '_s why it '_s not 0_stars .
neutral	i have mixed feelings about boohoo . com .
neutral	i love their website and products really bang on trend and some good prices .
neutral	however , i have sent for three bags over the last few_months .
neutral	one was sent damaged and i had to send back , one i kept but for a stud to come off quite quickly and then sent for a gorgeous clutch bag again damaged , one stud hanging off !!
neutral	!
neutral	i love their products when i see them but i probably will not be using them in the future because there should be much_better quality control , things should be checked and sent out in an undamaged state .
neutral	shame really .
neutral	also you have to really fight to get p_&_p back and then you dont always get it refunded , a lot of hassle !
neutral	!
neutral	acceptable price and good quality .
neutral	but too much of back and forth with logo format ( in house designerns should be able to change . png file to . jpg ) as a result missed deadline .
neutral	and the box was broken .
neutral	still_waiting a refund for express delivery .
neutral	this mirror replacement was not an exact_fit like they sold to me .
neutral	there is a 0 / 0 " shortage on top and bottom of mirror .
neutral	i found it very difficult to get the mouse to activate many of the last boxes on each webpage - next , order , etc .
neutral	had to click very hard 0 - 0 times to get it to work and almost gave up !
neutral	had a bit of an issue with the order , but cult_pens was pretty_decent about it and everything was received as stated very quickly , especially_considering i was ordering from canada .
neutral	however , my order consisted of a few mechanical_pencils manufactured by faber - castell and i was wholly disappointed .
neutral	the tk - fine felt extremely cheap , flimsy , lightweight , i couldn_'_t use them .
neutral	the tk - fine executive felt a little more robust although not as much as i would have preferred , but had a plastic grip that flares our closer to the tip of the pencil , where i tend to hold it so it was extremely uncomfortable to write with for long_periods of time , which is necessary as a student .
neutral	also completely unusable .
neutral	essentially i don_'_t use any of these pencils , although i '_m considering ordering replacements from cultpens , maybe a rotring rapidpro , since my experience with cultpens was certainly satisfactory .
neutral	third pair was supposed to ship to another address , but they shipped all to the first .
neutral	otherwise an excellent source for glasses and very responsive .
neutral	i know there '_s a lot of different domain companies out there ... but i think just out of habit , i '_ve always gone_through godaddy to get all my domains .
neutral	doesn_'_t mean their they best ... it '_s just somewhere i '_ve gone to get it since i started building websites .
neutral	an immediate_response would have helped to the problem of missing goods .
neutral	on the second shoent the labels should have been sent via ail ; they weren_'_t and i needed to phone and sl for them the next_day .
neutral	i now have z shipment going up the us next week so i hope this goes well .
neutral	jeg oprettede mig hos bibob hvor_jeg flyttede mit gamle nummer med .
neutral	problemet var dog , at der ved oprettelsen ikke_var_en advarsel med at det kunne tage op_til 00 dage før nummeret kunne flyttes .
neutral	det viste_sig at blive et problem , da min gamle mobil var_gået i stykker , og_den nye mobil havde_en mindre simkort - slot .
neutral	dette betød så at jeg_skulle komme til at stå uden telefon i 00 dage hvis_ikke mit bibob simkort blev åbnet .
neutral	heldigvis stod der , at jeg_kunne ringe_til kundeservice for at få det til at gå hurtigere - så_det gjorde jeg .
neutral	jeg_ringede først en torsdag hvor_jeg_fik af vide at det nye simkort ville kunne bruges dagen_efter - fredag .
neutral	men_da_det stadigvæk ikke virkede mandag ringede jeg til_dem_igen .
neutral	her fik_jeg_så af vide at der skulle gå 00 timer og hende den_anden havde gjort noget forkert - men at den nu ville_blive klar_til på torsdag .
neutral	om torsdagen virkede det stadigvæk ikke - og nu kunne det_ikke betale sig at ringe mere , da_der i første omgang stod at det_ville være klar den følgende mandag - hvilket det så heldigvis også var .
neutral	nu_har_jeg_så endelig en telefon der virker igen .
neutral	men_jeg_er virkelig utilfreds med hvordan skiftet er gået .
neutral	for det_første får_man ingen informationer om at det_kan tage så lang_tid at skifte nummer , og for det andet kan det_ikke passe at jeg_skal ringe ind to gange hvor_jeg bliver lovet noget , hvorefter så ingen ting sker .
neutral	jeg syntes virkelig at det_er dårligt kundeservice .
neutral	hvis_det_ikke_var fordi_de allerede havde trukket pengene havde_jeg skiftet selskab igen den torsdag hvor min mobil eftersigende skulle_være klar .
neutral	det_kan godt være at de er billige , men forvent ingen service .
neutral	it simply is the best of its kind , the downside is a very strange way of limiting customer purchases .
neutral	i figure if a person is using paypal and has_been a customer for more than two years , you would go easy ,
neutral	well then again it is what it is simple to use , as long you don_'_t need to buy a lot .
neutral	if not you have to spread the purchases to a few separate visits .
neutral	i had two back tires which were replaced and balanced .
neutral	prior to the change i had vibration from back which has now gone so this is great .
neutral	i have now got some vibration through the steering_wheel between 00 - 00mph which was not there before .
neutral	i unfortunately cannot prove this so will have to pay for front wheels to be re - balanced .
neutral	the website stated the product would be delivered next_day if ordered within next 0hrs .
neutral	however upon placing the order on a friday the courier company emailed to say that it would be delivered on the following_monday , not next_day as the website stated .
neutral	i ordered a muffler for an 00 toyota mr0 sc , it said it was the right one but it did not fit .
neutral	the pipe and flange was too small .
neutral	there was a small_dent on the muffler but nothing worth returning it over .
neutral	i am having it welded on .
neutral	we bought the car used so it may not be that the aftermarket header and exhaust was not the right size so i recommend you look at the diameter of the pipe before ordering .
neutral	i was told in the beginning that the first month was $ 0 . 00 .
neutral	after much planning and no further searches for a storage_facility , when the sign_up and move in day arrived , the truth was that that offer only applied to new customers .
neutral	since i already had one compartment , i wasn_'_t eligible for the $ 0 . 00 offer .
neutral	it would seem to me that existing customers should be treated equal to new comers if not preferentially .
neutral	printing quality is good but the stitching quality is not so good .
neutral	i arranged for the mobile service to fit four new tyres for our care , booking a friday_afternoon appt .
neutral	after waiting in all afternoon , i got a call around_0pm , saying that the fitter had been held up , and wouldn_'_t be able to make it .
neutral	the appt was rearranged for first thing saturday , and went quite smoothly when it eventually happened ...
neutral	i asked the person_who called about ' compensation ', and they were quite happy to offer a partial_refund .
neutral	haven_'_t yet driven car , so cannot_comment on the product , or indeed the actual fitting !
neutral	i ordered four cornilleau tacteo 00 schoolsport composite table_tennis bats and the picture illustrating them showed a blue and yellow bat , but the ones i got were grey and yellow .
neutral	i was considering sending them back , but after checking the website again , i noticed that they were the same model but in a different_colour - for my money , not as nice a colour - but as they were otherwise identical , i decided to keep the ones i ' d been sent .
neutral	delivery . com is only as good as the restaurants it serves .
neutral	some -- like thailand restaurant on castro street -- deliver almost_instantaneously .
neutral	others take quite a bit of time , and sometimes food arrives lukewarm or cold .
neutral	and there '_s no way to know which is which before you order .
neutral	it '_s a bit of a crapshoot , but you can , by ordering from different restaurants , develop a profile of each .
neutral	too bad it has to be by trial and error ......
neutral	i had difficulties with ordering my hotel_room .
neutral	i wasn_'_t notified that my reservation was accepted and had to call the toll_free number for assistance .
neutral	i was about to assume that my request was not accepted and almost reserved another room with another site .
neutral	i would have been upset if i ended_up paying for 0 rooms .
neutral	the price and selection of locations offered was very good .
neutral	this is my first book - it .
neutral	we '_ll see how the service stacks up .
neutral	i ordered a tail_light on 0 - 00 - 0000 part 0000000 and i received on part gm0000000v on 0 - 00 - 0000 .
neutral	i reorder part gm0000000v on 0 - 00 - 0000 thinking the parts were in the wrong bins .
neutral	this time i received the part gm0000000v .
neutral	i have requested a call_tag for the first part gm0000000v that was wrong , it should have been as ordered part 0000000 .
neutral	i have two parts gm0000000v , one needs to be returned .
neutral	all this is as a result of the wrong part being shipped to me on the first order .
neutral	please send me part 0000000 and a call_tag for part gm0000000v .
neutral	both of these parts have been paid for .
neutral	if the first order had been filled_correctly none of this would have happened .
neutral	would it be possible to talk to a person ?
neutral	thank_you very much
neutral	we enjoy searching for airfare .
neutral	the only problem is that there us no airlines '_s booking confirmation for you to go back to change seat .
neutral	travelocity '_s confirmation is not good enough as it will not the same as your airlines travel confirmation .
neutral	we recently booked for our trip to asia and unable to find our booking on kerea airlines web_site .
neutral	unfortunately one of many web - sites showing required item ' in stock ' when it had become unavailable .
neutral	' in stock ' should mean on the shelf , not ' usually available from our wholesalers "
neutral	we loved broyhill furniture , our last living_room set was broyhill .
neutral	setting_up delivery was a very frustrating experience .
neutral	our new home didn_'_t have any living_room furniture , so i purchased broyhill mckinney 0000 sofa and love seat size chair with ottoman when it finally arrived 0_weeks_later , there was no throw blanket , which the online demo video clearly_indicated was included with my order .
neutral	if i had to do it over , i would not buy furniture from your company online .
neutral	the delivery was not when promised and items were missing .
neutral	upon return to the us - we received two additional_charges on our credit_card and an invoice .
neutral	still_haven_'_t figured_out what they are for as they are in italian but they seem tax related .
neutral	the total we spent was approx $ 0000 us for 0wks rental .
neutral	with the added fees it '_s approx $ 0000 us .
neutral	product was great but was delivered to wrong house number , wrong road with no card left .
neutral	ended_up receieving product 0 days_later than paid for as a result .
neutral	good price , comfortable , but scratches very easily and the last one was damaged by showering !
neutral	bought a phone via amazon - all good .
neutral	phone developed a fault 0 months later - told me to contact manufacturer .
neutral	i did this , who informed me that as the phone is not made anymore ( and therefore can '_t just be replaced ), i would need to go back to caboodle , who could :
neutral	a ) refund me
neutral	b ) return the phone and it '_s 00 year_guarantee to the manufacturer who would refund caboodle .
neutral	caboodle were not interested in fulfilling their duties as a responsible seller .
neutral	update_: thanks to this review and another one posted elsewhere , plus some email persistence on my part , caboodle has recognised their duties as a decent company and agreed to refund the goods .
neutral	review rating updated accordingly , subject to successful conclusion of this little episode of course .
neutral	there '_s no reason_why a pair of sunglasses should take 0_weeks to get to my front_door_step .
neutral	i once ordered an idle control_valve and got a vacuum switch instead .
neutral	don_'_t understand_why i had to pay for return shipping when the part was boxed wrong and not my fault .
neutral	i try not to order from you unless i have to .
neutral	cumbersome process if something_goes_wrong with order and i ' d rather pay more elsewhere and get better service .
neutral	thank_you for suppling me with a tumble_dryer but i do not what to be your friend on facebook or follow you on twitter !
neutral	i do not want an extended warrenty if i had i would have bought it with the appliance .
neutral	if i want to use you again i '_ll contact you .
neutral	in the mean time please leave me alone
neutral	after the purchase i cam across a coupon that would have saved me quite a bit .
neutral	regrettably you didn_'_t inform_me .
neutral	ordering and shipping of part was great .
neutral	the issue is that the part was defective .
neutral	fuel_pump only worked for about five minuets and then went bad .
neutral	i am in the process of returning the defective pump .
neutral	everyone here is very nice and pleasant to do_business with .
neutral	my most_recent_visit was to swap out my snow_tires for summer_tires .
neutral	i was surprised to see the tire inflation light on when i drove_away from the appointment , but thought it was the computer recalibrating .
neutral	when i got home i found that one tire had only 00_psi .
neutral	i filled it and everything has_been ok .
neutral	i will admit that it makes me a little_worried that my life could depend_on those tires .
neutral	supplement_warehouse is great .
neutral	i love the price beating feature of their website .
neutral	however , the shipping_costs seem to often outweigh the savings .
neutral	it also often seems to take a very long time to get my merchandise .
neutral	i still use them when it makes_sense , but they are by no means my sole source .
neutral	i purchased the dryer booster and planned on installing it myself .
neutral	it was very easy to install but had a design issue .
neutral	the bracket needs to be installed towards the very outer edge of the fan body .
neutral	if you install it flush with the unit , the screws interferes with the ability of the fan to turn .
neutral	this will cause your unit to over heat and possibly burn the motor .
neutral	luckily i realized it in a few_minutes and unplugged the unit .
neutral	i called ecomfort . com and expressed my issues and tried to process a return of the product and get an exchage for a product that worked .
neutral	i also asked for help to see if maybe there was an easy fix .
neutral	the customer service rep on the phone was unhelpful and told me to email her engineer who still_hasn_'_t responded to my email .
neutral	she also told me that if i didn_'_t use a contracter , it voids the warantee with their company .
neutral	i called the manufacturer and within 0 minute had the unit reinstalled properly .
neutral	fantech has a great customer service department .
neutral	i am not sure why ecomfort . com didn_'_t tell me to call them .
neutral	the unit is working_properly and has a great air speed output !
neutral	i received an order for christmas decorations which was incompletelacked any suggestion that the items were to be shipped later .
neutral	i therfore rightly assumed there had been an error in the dispatch dept .
neutral	i phoned to notify festive_lights of the error and was told the missing items would be sent .
neutral	there was no further communication from festive_lights and i was not informed when the missing items would arrive and who the carrier would be . whilst i was out of the house the items were deivered to a neighbour without my knowledge .
neutral	if i had not been on friendly terms with my neighbour i could still be chasing that delivery today .
neutral	festive_lights sent the original package by dpd and i was able to track the passage to within an_hour .
neutral	no such luck with the follow_up delivery which was via_fedex with no tracking_information .
neutral	good product when it is right , but service has dipped since the last time i used printing . com .
neutral	i watied so long for the game i wanted i ended_up getting the same game at a different shop , but when it come i was happy to see it was brand_new and not been opened
neutral	everything was great till i started to install the visors , once installed the 0 came to the drivers_side and while i was peeling the tape i noticed that toward the front if the visor was cracked and had been glued so i had no choice but to finish my work since all the others were installed , doesn_'_t thecompany double_check or triple_check an item before it gets sent to shipping ?
neutral	i found the process to be easy and simple with good information on the ship , cabins , pricing etc .
neutral	readily_available .
neutral	one disappointment was the time available to pay the deposit prior to the cabin hold expiring .
neutral	this provided less_than 00_hours to pay ( most of which was on a sunday ) which seems unreasonable ,
neutral	it was made worse , as checking emails on monday_morning provided less that an_hour for actioning .
neutral	simply , the time scales need to be reasonable .
neutral	i got ok from mike the owner to use groupon during blackout days - stated in my email that i showed frontdesk during drop_off .
neutral	he supposedly made notation in system .
neutral	but when i picked car up frontdesk had no_idea .
neutral	had to explain situation and dig luggage for hardcopy email .
neutral	why was the 0nd time needed ?
neutral	need to get on the ball .
neutral	the product was reasonable quality , however delivered 0 days_later than promised on the order .
neutral	this meant i had a challenge to pick it ip ahead of flying out for the golf tournament .
neutral	the trophy was machine engraved .
neutral	when i first try to order this , the vendor refused to ship it to my daughter '_s home in de , so i had to have her order it .
neutral	i was really impressed with the whole_process from music_magpie .
neutral	they let_me know every_step along the way abd what was happening at each_stage .
neutral	the communication was fautless .
neutral	the only_downfall was the pricing offered .
neutral	the odd price was acceptable but most of them were pitiful and makes it almost pointless going through this process .
neutral	for the savings that i recieved i wasn_'_t truely satisfied with the delivery time .
neutral	in addition , the radiator that i ordered was not the right one .
neutral	i had to modify the install onto my vehicle in order for it to fit right .
neutral	i would have done better off spending the additional $_00 . 00 and gotten my order in one stop with no delay .
neutral	this might help me for items that i '_m not in a hurry for but not really worth it for parts that i need now .
neutral	damage allot of packages
neutral	must be very careful many bad sellers and prices are usualy high
neutral	you are not shipping to hi .
neutral	that '_s bad !
neutral	!
neutral	been waiting for my sniper elite v0 key to come in .
neutral	say '_s they are out of keys and not a single response from them .
neutral	i really ordered the salmon but the dog seems to like your bison and venison combo .
neutral	hi , how r u , like the store good prices , do not care 0 ur return_policy , i have 0 pay 0 return
neutral	when the wrong item was sent , i paid 0 the parts by credit_card , not a bad card , a good 0
neutral	i believe that a refund should be made rt now not 00 days , we pay now , not 00days later
neutral	the sales man was very helpful !
neutral	this is my first time 0 buy online and he helped_me so we \ r good there . u may want 0 rethink ur return_policy , not 0 sure i will buy from ur store
neutral	again my friends do know about ur store , was asked where did u buy ur parts i told them
neutral	everything was good until i get a call wrong timing_belt !
neutral	u guys no the machanic is on the on the clock so i had to go quick and find 0 . any way mayb u people will give some thought to this matter , treat ur customers good and we always come_back , lose 0 u lose 00
neutral	thank u 0 ur time , regards thomas m .
neutral	,
neutral	the whole_process of ordering the my tyres from black_circles was a good experience , a very easy and pleasant transaction .
neutral	however the garage that i selected was not as pleasant .
neutral	for a start i had pay additional £ 0 . 00 for the privilege to use this place ( which would make you think you receive some sort of extra service or perk for going there !)
neutral	it was the opposite they made me wait over an 0hr for a 00 minute job .
neutral	with no expiation or common curiosity of an_apology i left pretty disappointed as everything else was impressive .
neutral	i ordered two refilled hp00 cartridges , one black and one color .
neutral	the package arrived undamaged , but the color_cartridge had leaked - badly .
neutral	i didn_'_t want to risk the black one going bad fast ( and they only tell you that the ink levels won_'_t read correctly when you get the cartridges , afaik ) so i asked to rma them .
neutral	first customer service emailed me a label to print (!)
neutral	but when i told them the printer doesn_'_t work without both black and color carts installed , then mailed me another one .
neutral	i got a full_refund , shipping as well .
neutral	so i suggest you order new products from them , but maybe not the refilled ones ...
neutral	i placed an order on friday_morning and it was dispatched on tuesday ... this sais a lot ..
neutral	don_'_t know what i bought from them buying almost everything on line and don_'_t keep_up with vendors unless i have a problem
neutral	had to order part through ebay at extra_cost because the car part_kings website did not let_me complete checkout .
neutral	i tried 0 different computers in different_locations but could not enter my credit_card details and after one week still had a problem .
neutral	the help team couldn_'_t fix the problem either and stopped communicating after a few_days and before the problem was resolved .
neutral	please add a collection notes and delivery notes or description please
neutral	received 0 of my 0 parts ....
neutral	i processed quite a large order with many multiple - bags of assorted crisps and a few other unique items .
neutral	they did not have szechuan pepper so added two more christmas puddings to my order - bizarre !!
neutral	why not add more crisps .
neutral	obviously i had ordered the amount of christmas puddings i needed , what could i possibly do with two more highly specialized items , wouldn_'_t have been more appropriate and / or sensible to either back - order the pepper or just add more generic items like crisps .
neutral	now i have 0 christmas puddings for 0 people .
neutral	this could have been resolved by a quick email to me during the packing / processing phase , or by a question during the ordering_process .
neutral	apart_from this small part of the process , everything else was top_notch and was definitely a 0_star experience .
neutral	great price , great delivery ... part appeared new but had a hole in the taillight_lens .
neutral	i ordered 0 parts for my chevy .
neutral	all game quick and packaged really well .
neutral	one of the parts was suppose to have the chevy logo on it .
neutral	when i opened it , instead of a logo it was a big square .
neutral	the picture on the website is bad and it doesn_'_t say anything about it not having the logo .
neutral	they need to improve the descriptions and pictures .
neutral	non receipt will affect my placeing of future orders
neutral	purchased over £ 0000 worth of goods all came through very efficiently , 0 of the table lefs had red stains on it .
neutral	i called the after call service who dropped me an_email which i couldnt respond to also asked for photo evidence and i had to chase them twice since but not heard from them yet .
neutral	still_waiting !
neutral	!
neutral	i have used trip_advisor lot of times .
neutral	why is the website not user_friendly .
neutral	?
neutral	?
neutral	the items seems to be stuffed into an envelope obviously not big enough to handle the travel .
neutral	envelope was completely ripped opened when received .
neutral	apartment number was not on envelope causing delay in delivery .
neutral	also , address_label had tracking_number but i as told there was no tracking_number with my shipment .
neutral	could have saved a few_days of worry .
neutral	other than that , the snugg ipad_cover and car seat holder are fantastic products .
neutral	i recommend !
neutral	the information_regarding credit_card that sky_tours reqest '_s i found it to be frusrrating and a big waste of time , however i feel other than that the tickets price was fair .
neutral	the prices are awesome !
neutral	the parts seem to be the same thing you get in the store , but in a generic box .
neutral	the return isn_'_t so good , i got the wrong part , they don_'_t do exchanges , and you are charged a restocking_fee , plu a you have to pay the shipping back .. all making it jot worth the return .
neutral	shipping 0 large brake_rotors gets spendy
neutral	the parts arrived quickly , but they were very poorly_packed and one of them arrived broken .
neutral	they were accommodating about the return , but the whole problem could have been easily avoided by a piece of bubble_wrap .
neutral	overall , the good price was probably not worth the hassle of the return .
neutral	the coffee is extremely high_quality , and it costs less_than the ' name_brand '.
neutral	great crema , smooth dark espresso .
neutral	the guatemala coffee was a standout !
neutral	i have tried three flavors so_far dark ( esp , guat , and kenya ), and all are excellent !
neutral	next time , i will take a different approach with the braintrust at fedex in my area so i can get a delivery without 0 phone_calls .
neutral	i '_m generally satisfied with identity_guard '_s protection and services except for one area .
neutral	none of the computer protection services , id vault , privacy protect , and zone alarm work for me because i use mac_computers .
neutral	the system requirements for these services list only windows operating_systems .
neutral	macs have been around for a long time and are used by probably millions of people .
neutral	i '_m paying for services i cannot access .
neutral	why doesn_'_t identity_guard support apple macintosh operating_systems ?
neutral	i asked several months_ago for a way to reorder a card and edit the photo but there is no way to do it and nor is this company making changes to provide a easier shopping_experience .
neutral	the point of using your services is to make it as personalized as possible and the one function needed to edit an old card with the same shipping info is not available .
neutral	when calling customer service to find out if i '_m doing something wrong , they have no_explanation other than they are sorry .
neutral	this is my 0th card purchased and probably the last one .
neutral	i order a complete bathroom_suite online and choose to upgrade to saturday delivery .
neutral	now on the website it states the cut_off for saturday delivery cut_off is 00am on thursday so as i ordered my suite on a friday i wa expecting delivery on the follow saturday however the suite turned_up the next_day ( even_though i ordered after the cut_off time ) which would have been great but i wasn_'_t at home so had to rearrange delivery .
neutral	maybe i should have ordered over the phone .
neutral	like a lot of internet booking sites , the customer has to try many_times to get the best deal .
neutral	there is an offer on brittany ferries for a return trip at £_000 . 00 to france .
neutral	as far as i could see i fulfilled all the criteria to qualify for this deal and was quite happy to move my dates accordingly .
neutral	i had tried about 00 different combinations and still could not get below £_000 . 00 .
neutral	i then sent an_email to the company with a bit of a groan about this and was sent details of a trip that , with a little_bit of tweaking , was acceptable to me .
neutral	why is it that we have to keep changing our search details while you can look at the overall price structure ?
neutral	why can '_t the customer see all the prices on one screen and then make their choice ?
neutral	moan over , cheers , mike matthews
neutral	as stated great service , recieved in 0 day .
neutral	the algae destroy was a flop .
neutral	still bloomed , trying to get clean to close up .
neutral	good quality parts , reasonables prices .
neutral	but shipping and handling are " sucks " . 00 × 0 × 0 " box ??
neutral	for 0 small light weigt parts ??
neutral	it '_s just ridiculous . the delivery truck driver wanted me get in the truck and pull my box out because he assumed that the box was to heavy .. and waiting time for delivery even worse , i was schedule from 0 to 00 and driver showed_up after 0 pm .
neutral	my sugestion is .
neutral	change to a reliable delivery company .
neutral	i recieved the part , installed it & it would not allow engine to start .
neutral	i replaced the new unit with the old unit & the engine started .
neutral	i could not find a way to contact a person & only rec ' d .
neutral	instructions how to return the unit for a refund costing me a 00_% restocking_fee , for a unit that is defective .
neutral	i bought an exact unit locally & it has performed_perfectly . i would not recommend this company for anyone to do_business with .
neutral	read a review on another site that said the hotel had bed bugs and wasn_'_t that great was a little_worried_about it si decided to cancel early .
neutral	i ordered a jacket which didn_'_t fit so had to return it .
neutral	the returns_label advised wasn_'_t in the package so i e_- mailed a question around returns , to which i received no reply .
neutral	i had to phone to get the label e_- mailed .
neutral	in the meantime i ' d e_- mailed asking for sizing info for the item i wanted to replace it with , to which i received no reply .
neutral	the replacement item didn_'_t fit either and was £_00 cheaper_than the original item so i returned it and asked for the full_refund and confirmation that the difference had also been refunded and not just the value of the second item .
neutral	again , no reply .
neutral	there is no message to say the address is automated so i presume it '_s the correct one to use , so i cannot understand_why my messages are ignored .
neutral	really poor customer service for such an esteemed company .
neutral	i doubt i '_ll even have any response to this also , so i '_m probably wasting my time again .
neutral	ordering my parts was easy online but it takes_forever to ship it to me in hawaii .
neutral	after five days my parts still_haven_'_t been processed or shipped .
neutral	they should really do something about their ordering and shipping process .
neutral	also it says free shipping if i pick it up at thier store but not true .
neutral	they still charge for shipping to hawaii to thier own store no matter_how much i spend .
neutral	with the exception of the time it took to ship the item everything seems to be done well .
neutral	i was however somewhat disappointed that you did not have the oxygen_sensor in stock that i needed for the exhaust_system i bought .
neutral	i will use your web_page again because your pricing and shipping policy is better then most of your competition .
neutral	thanks .
neutral	i purchased parts for my car twice at partsgeek .
neutral	on my 0st purchased i needed to return some parts and all the communication was done via_email .
neutral	i almost got frustrated , because even_though the issue was solved , it took more than 0_weeks in order to receive the new parts .
neutral	instead of sending me the new parts i needed to returned them and purchased the parts again , wait for the credit to be posted in my cc and new parts to arrive .
neutral	in the mean time i didn_'_t have car .
neutral	i '_m sure that via phone , these type of issues can be solved faster .
neutral	in every email i provided my phone_number in order to speak with a customer service instead of going back and forward with emails .
neutral	i now have over thousand_miles using this oil and i find it is no better_than any other oil out there ( of course i have not done a oil sample , just seat of the pants ) save your money go with mobil , shell or chevron .
neutral	i use hostel_world a lot as it is very good to be able to have a large choice of hostels with lots of reviews .
neutral	unfortunately i got charged 0 times for the same hostel ( on same date ) and hostel_world would not give me the money back which always makes me worried recommending them whole - heartedly .
neutral	i thought i was ordering a rubber - stamp like product that i had seen in the neighborhood that had house numbers custom - made to be attached to the front of mailbox .
neutral	the price i paid was $ 0 . 00 for a plastic strip that was 0 0 / 0 inches by 0 0 / 0 inches and had my address -- 0 numbers -- on it .
neutral	if i had a big enough tape i could have made it with my label maker .
neutral	i contacted the company right_away and told them i was thinking it would be more for the money and they assured me the label was guaranteed for 0 years .
neutral	i think i am getting longer_than that from the house numbers they sell at home_depot .
neutral	i wish i could buy all my parts from partsgeek .
neutral	i have to shop from other online stores because they ship parts to hawaii that partsgeek don_'_t .
neutral	for example , struts for a 0000_nissan_pathfinder i was able to buy from another online store when partsgeek indicated they cannot ship this part to hawaii .....
neutral	very unclear checkout_process .
neutral	want to make it better , emulate amazon '_s .
neutral	ordered chrome door_handles for my f000 .
neutral	i got 0 of them correctly but the 0th came as a " door_opener ".
neutral	it is a jimmy stick for opening locked doors .
neutral	reported this and reordered stating in the order and to the customer service what the issue is and received a second order , still wrong .
neutral	now i have 0 " door_lock openers " and need my door_handle .
neutral	it has practically disabled my computer .
neutral	but i will keep the basic protection services .
neutral	i like them alot .
neutral	your not allowed to specify a quicker shipping way .
neutral	and i live on menemsha cross road not xrd .
neutral	and it wouldn_'_t let fe change the address .
neutral	the part is fine .
neutral	first time i ordered from bb , made a mistake on my order and i am syill waiting on the correct part .
neutral	we did finally receive the voucher from happy - cars . com .
neutral	they stated they sent it before , but no evidence of it in my inbox anywhere , after several_attempts to find it .
neutral	the negative was trying to communicate with the woman_who did not speak_english well .
neutral	i had to slowly keep spelling things , and was on hold for about 00_minutes .
neutral	computers still were down , so she promised to send voucher .
neutral	it did not arrive the next_day as_promised --- and the rental_agency had to contact me .
neutral	i finally emailed them , and had them directly send it to the agency , so it did get resolved .
neutral	just a hassle , and took up a good bit of time .
neutral	u need improve sms , possibly include its cost on ur bills .
neutral	i observed every message through ur network don_'_t get delivered .
neutral	started with a car where the battery was dead .
neutral	maintenance person wanted to jump the car .
neutral	we were not comfortable with this and demanded another car .
neutral	car we received had tank half full .
neutral	we spent the first 00_minutes trying to find a fueling station .
neutral	i like the price i paid , cheaper_than anywhere .
neutral	i didn_'_t understand the price differance for the same exact part .
neutral	but the shipping took over a week since i ordered !!
neutral	your shipping needs to step it up geeks !
neutral	!
neutral	i ordered a battery_charger for a fuji finepix 000 camera , as it was clear written at the batterychampion order itself , but i have received another completely different .
neutral	after some e_- mais exchanged about a return and delivery of the correct charger procedures , which i did not agree with , batterychampion accepted my arguments , and things became solved .
neutral	anyway some small improvements could be done on those 0 areas !
neutral	the item arrived lightening_fast -- two_days from hong_kong .
neutral	however , the original advert had indicated a " local warranty " and had a copy of the us flag leading anyone to the reasonable inclusion that a usa manufacturer '_s warranty was included .
neutral	in fact , no manufacturer '_s warranty was supplied , only one from digital_rev which would probably mean the need to return a problem item to hong_kong rather_than get service in the usa .
neutral	also , when purchasing with many us credit_cards and extra year of warranty is added to us warranties but not to those from elsewhere , so this protection is lost .
neutral	divital rev needs to make it clear that they are offering their own rather_than a manufacturer '_s warranty where this is the case .
neutral	booking . com is better because you can narrow_down your selection quicker with more options .
neutral	not being_able to select guest numbers straight_away wastes too much time
neutral	ja , i still looking for same dings : over 0 week missing : timing chain for audi 0000 a0 window regulater for audi_a0 0000 rear left .
neutral	please manage this .
neutral	and i like to have all me parts listest with prises in yahoo !
neutral	i requested a car wash and delivery to terminal .... got part two ... but my car was filthy and back bumper corner was scratched ... not as pleased with the service this time around !
neutral	other three parking experiences were perfect ... this one a dud .
neutral	my first order several months_ago went_smoothly and rapidly .
neutral	this one , however , took far too_long .
neutral	first month for $ 0 . 00 .
neutral	now that '_s a joke , if i ever heard one .
neutral	sure there are some units that this applies to , but for the one i needed
neutral	i couldn_'_t get the first month for a dollar .
neutral	plus i had to get insurance for
neutral	this unit , and purchase a lock ( not leave a deposit for a lock ) that i will have no
neutral	use for after my lease is up .
neutral	some public_storage_locations don_'_t offer the first month for a dollar at all .
neutral	as for customer service .
neutral	.
neutral	well , in 0000 , you don_'_t get good customer service
neutral	at many places , and public_storage customer service doesn_'_t up the ante '
neutral	not one bit .
neutral	it seems as if most online casinos are rigged .
neutral	the only_thing that seems not to be is when you actually play real people .
neutral	assuming they are real .
neutral	absolutely horrific customer service , good products and reasonably fast delivery .... tried to get in touch with the company for three_days with little result , my emails with questions on placed order got answered long after the products were delivered ... still the products are all right and represent great value for money
neutral	purchased a part advertised to work with my vehicle , but the electrical_connector didn_'_t fit , so i had to return it .
neutral	i '_m now expected to pay return shipping and the return process is really kind of just rubbing me the wrong way .
neutral	to their credit , they got back to me promptly , but i found the same product for a comparable price elsewhere .
neutral	happy with the ebookers pricing , booking 0 seperate hotels for a good price , but the user_interface is clunky .
neutral	the front_end gets 0 / 00 , but as soon as you go to book and confirm your reservations , the interface is more difficult to navigate ; e . g .
neutral	on the confirmation and payment page ,.
neutral	could be greatly_improved .
neutral	i have no_complaints about the supplements them_selves but some of the bottles are a 00 count bottle and the dosages are up to 0 pills a day .
neutral	that '_s a very short time for the 00 + dollar price on most supplements .
neutral	hopefully as the company grows onnit can become a little more competitive .
neutral	i just can '_t afford to pay that much for monthly orders .
neutral	the issue i have with this service for this price is by the time i get an alert from you , i have applied for a card , received it and used it .
neutral	then i get an alert , which means if i can do that , so can anyone_else ... and for the price i pay i think not only should the notification be faster but you should help freeze use , not just tell me how to do it .
neutral	i am_currently researching other credit services cause this does not seem appropriate though i have had this service for years it might be time to change .
neutral	with technology the way it is , i do not see why i would not get a notice the very day or day after an application is made .
neutral	good and prompt response .
neutral	used these last_year , always seem to have trouble logging in .
neutral	also after getting into my account it cost more to renew than it did to buy a new policy .
neutral	still , best value out there .
neutral	i found the best prices here but the booking process online was extremely slow .
neutral	don_'_t know if there was something wrong with the site at the time but things that i typed into the fields wouldn_'_t show up on the screen until several seconds later .
neutral	made the process of booking very slow .
neutral	made me wonder_if my reservation actually was received but i got a confirmation_email so i guess it did .
neutral	if this is normal , this really needs to be fixed or upgraded .
neutral	i '_m sure the product when it arrives will be fine , however it didn_'_t arrive saturday as expected so was a bit disappointed .
neutral	arrived at toulouse airport at 00 . 00am to be told our car would be a few_minutes .
neutral	an_hour and a half later our " booked car " arrived .
neutral	unfortunately it wasn_'_t our " booked people mover " and we had no hope in fitting in 0 people along with a case each !!
neutral	after waiting in the queue again to speak with the counter staff and arguing that it was definitely not what we had ordered from australia they finally said they would try and find us a people mover van .
neutral	so , after over 0 hours waiting we had our van which proved to be quite an old vw converted van which proved most uncomfortable for those of us who drew the short straw and got the back seat - no airconditioning !!
neutral	we refused to let the van dampen our holiday spirit but it certainly didn_'_t match the mercedes van we had driven the previous year in italy .
neutral	the staff could have been a lot more friendly ( except for the one young girl who spoke_english ) and attempt to lessen our stress and what we were going to do next if they didn_'_t come up with the goods .
neutral	can '_t down load the wallpaper on you iphone
neutral	a little_pricey .
neutral	did not have what i ordered even_though i ordered it the day it was to be delivered .
neutral	substituted plant with another that was very nice but did not ask if the substitution was ok .
neutral	i received an_email_letting_me know of the substitution .
neutral	very prompt delivery and quality plant .
neutral	quick on - line processing of order .
neutral	prompt delivery but one of four parts ordered arrived broken ( item value : $_000 ).
neutral	the shipping box was intact and there were no broken pieces in the box so will assume it was shipped defective .
neutral	submitted service request on - line , received rma promptly but directions says return shipping will not be reimbursed .
neutral	kind of disturbing that i will have to pay for return / exchange after they shipped me a broken part !
neutral	also , the return direction says to make_sure there are no markings on the original parts box that would preclude restocking on shelf .
neutral	why would they say that if the part returned is broken ?
neutral	haven_'_t completed the exchange process so will have to complete 0nd half of survey after all is said and done .
neutral	the book prices were lower compared to other_sites and shipping options were reasonable as well .
neutral	i opted for the expedited_shipping to ensure i had my books well before my class start .
neutral	i received the shipping notification the next_day that all 0 books had shipped .
neutral	the first 0 books in my order arrived within the shipping window and are in great condition so i was happy with my choice , but that is where the good part ends .
neutral	my last book is lost somewhere in the mail system and i '_m not sure which system since the other books arrived by usps and ups .
neutral	the tracking_number for my 0rd book only takes me to the shopping home page .
neutral	i contacted customer_support and they have been very helpful with all my questions and concerns but they show my books were all shipped in a single package and they weren_'_t .
neutral	sadly , as of this review the 0rd book is still mia and now i '_m told there are no replacements available so i will be getting a refund .
neutral	all would seem good after that but i just bought the missing book from their website again with no_problems as it says they have plenty in stock .
neutral	so i '_m not sure where the disconnect is between stock_levels on the website and what customer service shows on their system .
neutral	my first time shopping bookbyte and i am overly pleased and will probably purchase books from them in the future despite this one hiccup .
neutral	i got my first prescription ever and used frames_direct .
neutral	the process was pretty easy and found a pair using the finder and virtual try on features .
neutral	i ordered a pair and they came pretty fast and were packaged safely .
neutral	they were beautiful glasses .
neutral	unfortunately , they did not fit my face the way they looked when i tried them on virtually and i had to return them .
neutral	getting a rma was pretty easy and just note that frames_direct charges a restocking_fee and a 00_% only refund on lenses .
neutral	plus you pay shippong ...
neutral	i knew all of this when i ordered , so no_complaints on the penalty fees .
neutral	but - there are any other_places to order glasses on line that offer full_refund ( even for lenses ) so shop around .
neutral	i won_'_t be coming_back .
neutral	i enjoy the company and how it stands by that if they won_'_t use it , they won_'_t sell it .
neutral	i '_ve been with them since 0000 and like the selection of what they sell .
neutral	with that being said , i did run_into problems that i believe were not properly handled until i contacted customer service myself .
neutral	after emailing customer service and talking to them , the issue was closed .
neutral	still doesn_'_t change the fact that i think its a great company and that i had the bad luck of running into a bad_experience .
neutral	the book is great .
neutral	however i was annoyed to later find out that i could have bought it cheaper if done through one of cewe '_s other_companies .
neutral	as jessops and photoworld are all part of cewe now , the pricing should be the same .
neutral	i have always liked ami because they have an_enormous variety at decent prices .
neutral	their customer service , however , is something to be desired .
neutral	over a week had passed since i placed my recent order , and there had been no updates , the website said my order was still " processing ," as were my previous 0 orders that have already been received ...
neutral	i emailed their customer service and received an_automated_response saying they are working on my order and i will hear back within 00 - 00hrs , but i didn_'_t .
neutral	so i tried_calling customer service , and after being placed on hold for over 00minutes , i was rerouted to some voicemail box to leave a message .
neutral	that happened three_times before i actually got to speak to a live_person .
neutral	then i was told that something happened to my order between the processing and shipping departments so my order was never shipped , but i should hear back before the end of the day .
neutral	later that evening i finally got an_email_saying my order was shipped .
neutral	this isn_'_t the first time ami has screwed_up an order .
neutral	i '_ve received wrong sizes , wrong colors , and when i call customer service , the item i originally ordered is out of stock so i '_m out of luck .
neutral	i think if ami added online_chat support , their customer service experience would be greatly_improved .
neutral	location of the desk was difficult , with misleading directions being provided right up to within 00 feet of the rep .
neutral	the car given us , although new , was larger than that reserved , which gave_us considerable concern relative to road width .
neutral	furthermore , it was an inconsistent ride , with a very lumpy transmission / drivetrain .
neutral	pulling up to a parking spot head - on was nerve_wracking , as the car would actually reverse after proceeding forward , as if on an incline .
neutral	sight lines remained an issue throughout our rental period .
neutral	the return process was less_than satisfactory .
neutral	gatwick airport offers rental returns little in the way of direction ; when at last the proper garage level is found , one is left to conduct the entire return process on one '_s own .
neutral	depositing a key in an envelope and into a clogged metal chute provides no confirmation that timely receipt has occurred .
neutral	a receipt of some sort should be made available .
neutral	finally , the rates discussed and ultimately charged my credit_card did not conform to the amount established at the time of my reservation .
neutral	payments could be made faster
neutral	sometimes troublesome if your plans_change , it is every hard to get refunded by the course or the site , usually impossible .
neutral	however , usually the teetimes are discounted and is a great way to save_money if headed straight to the course , or in the morning .
neutral	very difficult to communicate by phone message or email , as they often don_'_t respond to either .
neutral	company needs to inform when they have shipped and ship in a more reasonable time frame .
neutral	i '_m not sure about my part number and need to call a live_person to help me asap ( and don_' d have time to open a ticket online ).
neutral	otherwise , it will be better to order from the competition .
neutral	if you really want to compete online , then provide an option to include the vin_# to help choose the right part online .
neutral	btw , i '_ve placed many orders online in the past since you have good deals .
neutral	when goods are delivered they arrive very quickly , and are of good quality , but on random occasions nothing turns up !
neutral	trying to get hold of [_name ] is impossible - no one answers the phone , no one responds to emails .
neutral	so the only resort is to raise a paypal_dispute to get a refund !
neutral	**** always use paypal when dealing_with iwantpants !!
neutral	****
neutral	at_least you will have a way of getting your money back .
neutral	i really_liked the lens prescription but the frames were off and needed to sent back .
neutral	unfortunately , the turnaround is not very convenient .
neutral	we will see after i get the new set .
neutral	the customer service folks , though , seek to be helpful .
neutral	it was fast but i only got part of my order and order them at same time no email to say why .
neutral	i need it to get back on the road ...
neutral	got a good price on the book i needed for my daughter '_s college class , paid for expedited_shipping , but the book came 0 days_later than what was expected .
neutral	ultimately not a problem , but paying extra for shipping one would expect actually using a 0nd day air shipper not usps_priority_mail with the package on a truck coming across the continental us which took a fair amount of time this time of year .
neutral	fix the shipping problems and i could give 0_stars .
neutral	i waited one day to confirm my reservation and i missed my window of opportunity for getting a good rate at the hotel i wanted .
neutral	i don_'_t know if that was my fault or if the website had a way of figuring_out i was thinking about reserving a room , but hesitated , and ended_up having to reserve the room at a higher rate .
neutral	i don_'_t know .
neutral	is a web_site that intuitive ?
neutral	after purchasingr borderlands_0 from cjs_keys with paypal , i verified myself in the autokey_system using my phone .
neutral	the verification was completed , but i then recieved an " anti_- fraud " email from cjs asking me to prove that i exist by giving cjs_keys my personal identity information .
neutral	the email asked for things such as my passport , drivers_license , bank statements , etc ...
neutral	i did not give cjs any important information , but instead complained about how absurd this is and i immediately got my product key .
neutral	i would urge_anyone_else who gets this ' anti_- fraud ' email not to give them your identity .
neutral	paypal already has anti_- fraud measurements in place , and i '_m pretty sure it is illegal to demand personal identity information before giving you the product you already paid for .
neutral	even if it isn_'_t illegal , it is bad business and i do not like the way cjs has done this .
neutral	nevertheless , they gave_me my product key after the complaint .
neutral	no questions_asked , and the key worked so i ' d give it a 0 / 0
neutral	great place to find auto_parts , but delivery is slow from the east_coast to west_coast , cuz you dont let customers choose the type of delivery service .
neutral	ie : ups , fed_ex , or mail , etc
neutral	deliveries usually arrive on time but when there is a problem customer service is useless
neutral	cannot_speak to a live_person at any time was sent the wrong parts
neutral	had many comunications problems .
neutral	after payment you stop responding my emails and i got a litlle afraid .
neutral	also did not deliver produt in anounced time .
neutral	however , item arrived in good conditions
neutral	best regards
neutral	happy new year
neutral	a company can pull . a stroke like that unhappy customer ray scott
neutral	.
neutral	i think the order was professionally_handled , but it took nearly two_weeks to arrive .
neutral	good with past orders . last order was incomplete with no explaination . tried to e_-_mail had problems . although resolved , i am reconsidering any more buys . need to better communicate .
neutral	in my opinion the light brown color of the boot is not appealing at all .
neutral	maybe i shouldn_'_t post this just send them back - but then will probalby be a re - stock fee
neutral	these cards are great but not enough options in card covers for kids
neutral	when i use the sound that i speak , my voice don_'_t is reconized by the program .
neutral	i go bye a extern microfone and try a second way .
neutral	sometimes the sound that the program speak is not good .
neutral	we were happy with the experience but our peugeot_000 had bad brakes .
neutral	next time wer '_ll remember that europen cars have very little trunk space .
neutral	the car ws rated " two small suitcases " but we definitely could not fit 0 cary -_ons in the trunk .
neutral	only_downside .
neutral	the website doesn_'_t seem to want to allow you to set_up your own account simply .
neutral	when booking a number of visits i had to keep re - entering my information .
neutral	my account won_'_t function correctly .
neutral	the individuals information about the hours the storage_facility was open was incorrect .
neutral	i do believe the agent at sparefoot did not have the correct info .
neutral	i do not believe he was lying .
neutral	alright , folks were friendly & i didn_'_t have to wait a long time for service to be completed ,{ one new tire purchased , all 0 rotated } the cost was about what i expected . the next_day though , i was disappointed to find that the donut / tire had been thrown_into the trunk , not affixed , and the trunk floor piece had been merely thrown in as well , on top of the emergency tire , which indicated a lack of customer appreciation & a lame work_ethic , from whoever was responsible for the task . basic customer service apparently is not a priority at town_fair_tire .
neutral	happy with product !
neutral	very disappointed with returns_policy as they don_'_t have one had to pay £_00 to return forks !!
neutral	so any saving on price is gone merlin_cycles lack behind there rivals such as <_external link_removed_>
neutral	i had ordered a part for my chrysler 0th ave and waited for over a week to receive it !
neutral	when i did receive the part and spent all the hard work installing it into my vehicle , the part did not work it was a defective and now i have to wait even longer for my car to be fixed , this is setting me back big time !!!
neutral	like i said at_least there is a return_policy plus if you are smart you will get insurance on what you order online !!
neutral	!
neutral	oldies has some of the best prices around on lots of obscure titles .
neutral	however the per item shipping charge for orders to canada gets out of hand when placing large orders .
neutral	i might order more if shipping_charges were capped at some level .
neutral	i order 0 parts from merlin and received order confirmation and tracking_information shortly_after .
neutral	the problems began when i received my package with only 0 components in the box .
neutral	the box included a packing sheet with all 0 checked off and a note_saying that the shipment was split in to 0 boxes .
neutral	i checked the tracking_number and it showed as delivered .
neutral	i contacted merlin to see what had happened to my order and was told to wait for the other parcel to arrive .
neutral	a week_later i have now abandoned the tracking_system and resorted to calling around to the local post_offices to track down the package on my own .
neutral	eventually i found my parcel and was able to secure delivery of the rest of my order .
neutral	i wanted this part to replace a broken right side_mirror .
neutral	price was exceptional , but there didn_'_t seem to be a way to choose the color .
neutral	so , i contacted customer service via_e_-_mail to ask if i could choose a color , and their response didn_'_t help at all !
neutral	they simply indicated i may get one of three different finishes on the part .
neutral	in fact , the part showed online with only two possibilities .
neutral	not only did they not indicate if i could choose , but they added one more color i didn_'_t want !
neutral	the part happened to be delivered in the exact color i wanted , in a timely_manner .
neutral	all '_s well that ends well , i guess !
neutral	checkout was easy and quick using bitcoins , but the published return_policy apparently does not apply to bitcoin purchases .
neutral	no documentation anywhere on the site states that bitcoin purchases cannot be returned .
neutral	customer service lied to me , telling_me that bitpay doesn_'_t allow refunds , but this is a lie , because bitpay clearly_states in their own terms that they do support refunds .
neutral	so , customer service for pc_game_supply clearly lied to me .
neutral	ok so so ok so so
neutral	i do not like when i buy something and it turn out the seller does not have it is very frustrating .
neutral	but i got my money back .
neutral	thank u
neutral	part does not work .
neutral	willing to try another part .
neutral	the local royal_mail sorting_office would be half empty if it wasn_'_t for amazon '_s business .
neutral	but no normal bookshop or retail operation would survive if it only sold what people could identify and name on their shopping list : there is a razor_sharp focus in the search_engine , but the spontaneous browsing element is all but absent .
neutral	sorry guys , but readers often buy books that are shelved by topic near what we thought we might have bought at the outset , if we ever had a title or author to start with .
neutral	non_ho nulla di che lamentarmi tranne a riguardo dei tempi_di_consegna che_sono troppo lunghi
neutral	hi recently ordered a radiator for by 00 benz great price and came quickly however my mechanic said it came damaged but was able to install it two lips on the top were cracked off it wasn_'_t properly packed
neutral	offered £_00 for my phone .
neutral	sent it off and received ok . told my phone cover was broken so could only offer me £_00 so did i want to accept this ?
neutral	i phoned them and said it was in perfect working order when i sent it so could they recheck .
neutral	they emailed me back saying sorry , it was actually all ok so they would give me the full £_00 .
neutral	just wondering how many people would have just accepted the lower amount and if this happens a lot ........
neutral	it works like it was supposed to .
neutral	i reserved a car with high gas_mileage ( 00 mpg ) and received one with much_lower mileage ( 00 mpg ).
neutral	not acceptable .
neutral	ordered my item on wednesday_afternoon , dispatched immediatly but still_waiting for my item to be posted .
neutral	so so experience
neutral	the best value in las_vegas by_far .
neutral	the only_negative i would say is that the customer service agent was a little too pushy and aggressive on trying to get me to purchase the auto insurance_policy for $_00 per day , when the car_rental was only $_00 per day .
neutral	i checked with my insurance company and they told me not to purchase any coverage because i am fully covered for anything that might happen .
neutral	lax - the only time did not care was at a location near airport which offered valet service .
neutral	i don_'_t ever like the idea of leaving my keys with anyone .
neutral	ontario airport - very good location , the service is good .
neutral	one better would be to have the shuttle service which if too early is provided by a local taxi service and taxi service runs late , and are delays .
neutral	i don_'_t know who is suppose to pay for the shuttle run to & from the airport when it is a taxi service .
neutral	thank_you
neutral	i made an order then found i did not need part ordered and tried to cancel but told by email i could '_t cancel .
neutral	after receiving parts noticed order was not filled for nearly 0hour after i sent email canceling order !
neutral	had i not had to cancel service was great !
neutral	we used the big_bus_tours in london on 00 and 00th_july and found the commentaries very week .
neutral	both the live english_language , and the recordings in other languages , were not very informative .
neutral	for example , marble_arch wasn_'_t even mentioned on the live english_language commentary as we drove past it .
neutral	the commentary on the river_boat from the tower of london to westminster was excellent .
neutral	i liked being driven round london in an open double decker bus , but when i do it again i '_ll try another company .
neutral	they beat the box up bad enough to destroy the label .
neutral	they had to get parts_geek to reissue the label .
neutral	meanwhile my package is sitting here in the phoenix area and i can '_t install the water_pump and use my car .
neutral	to parts_geek -- ever heard of fedex ?
neutral	having placed an order for 0 items , only 0 arrived within the 0 - 0 days as stated with an_email_saying the other 0 were ' to follow ' even_though card payment had been taken .
neutral	over a week_later , i received 0 items which were completely different to what had been ordered ( grips instead of string ) and invoiced to somebody_else .
neutral	after calling up , my items were sent again meaning a further delay and i was requested to send back the wrong order with an enclosed label .
neutral	all a complete mess with little apology given by the person on the phone .
neutral	a shame as i have used tennisnuts before and found the service fine but feel an error and delay like this should warrant some form of compensation .
neutral	hasn_'_t everyone moved to craigslist yet ?
neutral	one of the original dot coms that never went away .
neutral	i guess it '_s alright , but its such a dated site .
neutral	haven_'_t bought anything from them in years so maybe it '_s better now .
neutral	hi everything its fine except im still_waiting for my item and its been more than 0 days
neutral	the lens are fine , but im very frustrated as they always send my small box of 00 lens in a large box and it never fits through the letterbox , surely its common_sense to have smaller packaging . i either have to take time out to go to post_office to collect or its dropped with a neighbour if they are in . hoping it can be sorted or otherwise i may have to order elsewhere . sorry .
neutral	unfortunately they had a " black out " period for the groupon i purchased a month in advance of this trip and now i will have to deal with groupon for a refund .
neutral	it said this qualified for free shipping and then it changed its mind .
neutral	this should be explained a bit better , if it qualifies or not .
neutral	not happy about that because i spent time messing_around with it seeing if it would change to free shipping .
neutral	i would love to have my cat_food automatically delivered to my house , but with the shipping_costs it is so much more_expensive than my local_petsmart .
neutral	if you were closer in price i would use your service all the time !
neutral	overall good experience with the website when i used my groupon , although your search was troublesome .
neutral	took me awhile to find blue_buffalo basics turkey cat_food as it wouldn_'_t show up under cat_food when i selected to view by brand .
neutral	had to search a few_times .
neutral	fast shipping .
neutral	wowcher in general offers some good deals , however most of the products are geared_towards the female market .
neutral	thus putting a restriction in the time available to redeem a wowcher wallet .
neutral	i had 00 pounds sterling wiped out of my account as i couldn_'_t find a suitable item during the time available to redeem my wowcher wallet .
neutral	perhaps a longer period of 0 - 0 months should be introduced .
neutral	customer_services were not very helpful either !!
neutral	!
neutral	they did ok got item .
neutral	great place to buy bulk workout stuff from .
neutral	would like to see better prices on shipping , and a wider_range of organic products ; other than that , i am very happy with the site .
neutral	i enjoyed my snicker .
neutral	i do not remember if i saw dimensions , but it was too small .
neutral	i am using it just not loving it as much as i thought .
neutral	this car_park is reasonably_priced and just competitive against others
neutral	even with the naughty booking_fee popped on the end .
neutral	the advertised price should be the end price .
neutral	they can pop_up the price a bit to cover , but ' booking_fee ' just puts people off .
neutral	i bought 0 refurbished laptop one for me and one for my sister , mine is fine but my sisters would not connect to the internet , i have had a boffin look at it and he said wi_-_fi card is faulty , i have bought a new card on e_- bay but this should have been spotted in the workshop .
neutral	price wise a very good deal but customer service is not set_up very well to help customer with problems in a timely_matter .
neutral	my problem with customer service is no one answer the phone and you are directed to send an e_-_mail which take 00 - 00_hours to respond mean while what ever you are doing has to wait for a responds .
neutral	i got an entropay account to make purchases overseas , 00 dollars later and i had topped up my first entropay card .
neutral	after returning the purchased goods , the funds showed 00 dollars balance and 0 . 00 available balance .
neutral	i emailed entropay support and they told me to wait 00 days to get the funds back .
neutral	00 days pass and my funds are not returned to my account , and my account has_been restricted because " i had not provided all the correct documentation ", so i emailed entropay again with the correct documentation and asking why my money had not been returned .
neutral	entropay then emailed me back and said the same response of 00 days .
neutral	then 0 minutes later after that email as i was writing a response to their generic response and how it had not solved my problem ...... i recieved another email from the same support guy stating that he had suspended my account permanently because of suspected suspicious_activity .
neutral	what .
neutral	the .
neutral	hell .
neutral	how is my activity suspicious when i gave you a copy of my card and my drivers_license ?
neutral	your support_team is horrible !
neutral	scam service .
neutral	you '_ll never get your money back .
neutral	update_: after over a month of fighting with entropay , the day after i posted this review , the anti_- fraud support manager emailed me about my account being suspended unjustifiably , reviewed my account , reinstated it , and refunded the 00 dollars to my card .
neutral	finally .
neutral	someone_who understood what i was saying and actually acted on my disappointment .
neutral	i just made a purchase with my 00 dollar card again .
neutral	we '_ll see if it goes through .
neutral	will update later with results .
neutral	why is shipping and handling so expensive and why don_'_t you give reoccurring customers a brake on the shipping and handling , your customer service sucks , but your web_site is cool and your product is good
neutral	my photo stamps were created without error .
neutral	the stamps looked nice , and they were less_expensive then [_external link ].
neutral	but i was dismayed to find that they had stamped their url on my stamps .
neutral	and they didn_'_t put only one , but two urls on my stamps .
neutral	i felt_like i was paying for the privilege of advertising for them .
neutral	if they don_'_t promise to stop that , they will get no return business from me .
neutral	its downfall began when it started to imitate facebook with various activity streams and actions .
neutral	i don_'_t understand how can anyone like to communicate like this with short , simple sentences that mustn '_t be longer that 000 characters or else they won_'_t be published ?
neutral	!
neutral	a bill outlining charges would be appreciated .
neutral	checked the wording to see if a 00 " tv could be sent with damge cover being included , if appeared that it was a restricted item but was able to be sent , however i was later advised that it could be sent minus any cover for being damaged in transit .
neutral	not impressed .
neutral	we made our first order which included some food that needed to be approved by our vet .
neutral	the vet - finder was neat but it does not work on an ipad , so i had to start my order over on my computer .
neutral	i placed the order and was notified that the vet would need to be contacted before the order could ship .
neutral	that was the last i heard for over over two_weeks .
neutral	the website showed that my order had been placed but no information was available on shipping or status .
neutral	i finally contacted the company and asked about the status of my order and they indicated that it took a while for my vet to confirm .
neutral	some communication that there was some sort of delay , either on the website or an_email would have given me a lot more confidence in my first order with petflow . com .
neutral	the bottom was all dented .
neutral	had to hammer that out .
neutral	and i had to put a washer in so the gears would stay together .
neutral	and the drain leaks .
neutral	i love the glasses and so did the kids .
neutral	however they were very cheap quality .
neutral	several pair were broken upon_arrival causing me not have enough for the party and several broke as the kids wore them .... made it very disappointing .
neutral	the website was ok . only problem was locking onto the apartment pictures .
neutral	they kept flying by .
neutral	this made it hard to study them

neutral	i ordered cup holder inserts for my 0000_trailblazer .
neutral	the price was not too bad , but once the shipping was added , the total came out to almost $_00 for two rubber inserts that aren_'_t even chevrolet parts .
neutral	they are small and light .
neutral	i can '_t imagine why shipping was so high , except as a way to boost revenue .
neutral	partsgeek would do well to charge what the actual shipping really costs , rather_than building profit into it .
neutral	delivery was quick , parts were as_advertised .
neutral	they will hold a cup .
neutral	all of my credit_card balances showing on your report were paid off in early_january , 0000 .
neutral	i would think that by now , february 00 , those payoffs would have been reflected in your report on me .
neutral	other than some more current credit_card charges , the only balance owing is the $_00 , 000 on my home equity line of credit .
neutral	it would also be helpful to know how how often my fico scores are updated .
neutral	rather worried that i did not receive confirmation within 0 minutes as_promised in the booking sheet .
neutral	you need to have more mods , maybe some limited_edition " home " made stuff .
neutral	i bet theres plenty of good modders in th uk .
neutral	or some mods from the us , easiwr for us here in finland to order from you than some store in the us .
neutral	i received the timing_belt kit in 0 days at a great price but unfortunately the gasket for the water_pump was missing .
neutral	i had to order it through another website and this delayed my truck being repaired by a week .
neutral	several_times now you have not been able to contact our vet for approval of my dog '_s description diet .
neutral	and you don_'_t communicate about it very well which leads to delays .
neutral	we needed a replacement part sent to us quickly while on vacation .
neutral	we bought the part with babycare . nl because they promised it would be delivered by the date we needed it .
neutral	unfortunately , the part was delivered 0 days_later than_expected , which_meant we didn_'_t get to use it .

neutral	i booked a car for 0 days with europcar via driveaway_holidays picking_up from heathrow .
neutral	due to a sudden family death i was only able to pick_up the car the next_day , meaning that i my car_rental was for one less day .
neutral	i tried to call europcar several_times to advise the one day '_s delay but " all their staff were busy ".
neutral	when picking_up the rental_car from europcar at_heathrow eurpocar said my car had been taken for another booking and i would have to pay them an extra $_00 - even_though the car was now onlky being rented for one less day .
neutral	after almost one hour at the check - in area they agreed to waive the extra_charge but only if i took the smallest car instead .
neutral	so i ended_up with a much smaller car , one less rental day plus all the hassle after my bereavement - all fo rthe same cost .
neutral	driveaway are greqt but never choose eurpopcar - i will go back to using avis who have always been first_class .
neutral	all went_smoothly with the rental , but when i dropped the car off the desk person told me i had committed to a full_tank of gas .
neutral	i thought i had agreed to have them fill up the car .
neutral	since i had only used a half of a tank , i was unhappy .
neutral	i was told there was nothing they could do about it and i had to contact autoeurope .
neutral	i have and am awaiting their response .
neutral	free shipping all over the site but was charged over $ 0 . 00 .
neutral	what gives ?
neutral	had to gall twice to get satisfaction .
neutral	product and price fine - but 0_weeks to deliver longer_than_expected !
neutral	did not like the $ 0 . 00 fee on a little $_00 card .
neutral	00_% markup ?
neutral	why have you started charging " sales_tax " on the final payment screen and not showing it when zip_code is entered ?
neutral	seams sneaky .....
neutral	why are you now charging sales_tax at all ?
neutral	you did not in the past !
neutral	i questioned the contact very closely about the sizing as , being a cyclist , i have very large legs compared to my other measurements .
neutral	based on their suggestions i went for xxl in the nicks - these are way too big ; loose on the legs and waist .
neutral	the chamois is also very stiff and not overly comfortable but this may be to do with the sizing issue .
neutral	the jersey is an xl and fits ok but is rather short for an xl and rides up easily .
neutral	also , the zipper sticks out around 0 - 0 inches from the bottom which looks and feels weird .
neutral	the colours and text are fine for a budget jersey .
neutral	i would recommend the jerseys as they are quite cheap ( in relation to other similar jerseys ) and its fun to make your own design and add text .
neutral	good for a casual jersey / mates team shirt for a laugh .
neutral	its only during the payment process you discover the pictures are of the " larger bunch " which i feel is misleading ( false_advertising ?)
neutral	however the price was still good so i don_'_t understand_why they use this underhand tactic .
neutral	i placed an order that was not all in stock so i was charged for two_separate deliveries even_though they arrived on the same pallet , a pallet you have to dispose of , which was a tad annoying as it was an extra £_00 for what i am not sure .
neutral	the two plants arrived quickly , but they where pot bound and the leaves where yellowing .
neutral	these where not very healthy specimins .
neutral	i have taken a photo of them in case they dont servive being planted out .
neutral	could do better .
neutral	i like the service but it never seems to be very clear for me when i use video ...
neutral	when making the order we were informed that the lights would be delivered between 00 - 00th_december .
neutral	today is the 00st and we have still not received them .
neutral	however we have a big problem as we leave on holiday today untiol 0th january and cannot take delivery .
neutral	we do not know what courier service is used so are unable to contact them to make delivery arrangements .
neutral	we live in a gated community and the gate will not allow access for delivery to us if we are not here .
neutral	please arrange for delivery on 0th january or after .
neutral	many_thanks
neutral	only down fall is the shipping_costs .
neutral	i guess they have to make up for the low_prices on the products somehow .
neutral	the avis girl was pushy and then rude when we decided not to upgrade .
neutral	the car was fine - in spite of what she told us !

neutral	i called , left a phone_number 0 / 00 / 00 and nobody got back to me . my hunting club has
neutral	purchased five unit from kms and i wanted better response .
neutral	called another dealer for odes part
neutral	haven_'_t received my order yet !
neutral	the office was full o f mechanics the front desck person eaten in the office and very poor_english ., i be in mavis before and was better front desck service .,
neutral	products were as_advertised .
neutral	great prices .
neutral	easy to navigate ordering system .
neutral	i would have rated 0_stars if customer service was more responsive and 0_stars if i wasn_'_t missing a part .
neutral	however , i was missing one of my parts and the lack of phone contact slows the response process .
neutral	i filled_out a cs ticket and received a generic response .
neutral	my project is waiting for a conclusive response .
neutral	still need the part i paid for ..
neutral	the glasses fit nicely and comfortable .
neutral	however it took four weeks to get it .
neutral	i read all other comments about " fast service " of framesdirect . com so i did not know why my order took so long .
neutral	the quality of the items purchased was outstanding but the automatic phone system stunk i order one item and got a confirmation_email then order another and never received a confirmation ordered again and then it looked as if it was cancelled and tried to contact over the phone but was unsucceful and then the parts arrived but after i order somewhere_else answer your phone !!!
neutral	!
neutral	if i like the service , i '_ll use it again .
neutral	i '_ll probably be back .
neutral	good prices but shipping should be free after hitting 00 . 00 dollars .
neutral	part numbers should be universal most sites don_'_t like people to compare prices plus the box number should be the same as the site number .
neutral	my biggest problem is lack of people to answer the phone to solve problems .
neutral	00 to 00 extra hours and going back and forth with email will keep the car off the road much to long .
neutral	i had to go to another site to solve my problems .
neutral	i ordered 0 things , you only had 0 in stock .
neutral	i hope i don_'_t get charged for 0 separate shipping fees just because you did not have what i ordered .
neutral	it has also been a long time since i ordered .
neutral	the one item i did receive was good quality , hoping for the best on the rest !

neutral	while ordering the parcel collection i was pleasantly_surprised that there was a collection window between 0 :_00pm and 0 :_00pm .
neutral	too good to be true .
neutral	since it was not stated in the paperwork i did ask back at the customer service .
neutral	after a few email , dan from the customer service did set the collection window between 0pm and 0pm .
neutral	0 :_00pm the parcel was collected and delivery ( to germany ) did take 0 days less then expected .
neutral	surprise_surprise .
neutral	when you sign_up to save_money that '_s exactly_what you get with travelocity .
neutral	that '_s the good points but what you don_'_t know is that you get seats no one wants .
neutral	i '_ve flown several_times and i always get the seats at the back of the plane , noisy smelly and of course the last row the seats don_'_t recline .
neutral	i just got back from hawaii today and my seats were the row before the exit row .
neutral	you guessed it those seats don_'_t recline either .
neutral	in the future i might spend more money for the comfort if i '_m flying more than 0 hours .
neutral	provider gave_us a first car with the car recharger broken so the navigator was useless .
neutral	they took two hours to change the car in a smaller one .
neutral	this second one was dirty and it was missing the boot cover so they let us wait to clean the car and insert the cover .
neutral	we waited at car_rental parking .
neutral	the second provider who gave_us the second car didn_'_t speak_english .
neutral	the navigator provided was a very old garmin who restarted every time we restarted the car engine .

neutral	not a massive issue - just suprising in this day and age .
neutral	your website is easy to work with .
neutral	the delivery was great .

neutral	i sent a email earlier today but have not received an answer which really surprised me .
neutral	i hope they get in touch with me ?
neutral	from ordering to delivery was 00 days !
neutral	first , my order was ' out of stock ' - which i did not know about .
neutral	then i was told delivery would be 0 - 0 days .

neutral	the previous shirts were 000_% cotton and were huge and fit great , while these new shirts i think are 00 / 00 and don_'_t even fit now .

neutral	the parts picture was not correct and the title right hand or left_hand should read driver_side or passenger_side to avoid confusion .
neutral	please_note if you order or get the wrong part you pay shipping it back .
neutral	sometimes when you do a search you are led to websites that do not exist or out of date , does anyone review this
neutral	... i had some trouble with a pre_- order .
neutral	i pre_- orded two copies of mass_effect 0 n0 edition , only to have one processed and sent out .
neutral	there was no conscious communication by the company to inform_me that only one had been dispatched .
neutral	leaving the person_who i was getting the game for with no copy on release day .
neutral	if i had been informed that one had been cancelled due to stock restrictions i may have been able to procure one elsewhere , this wasn_'_t the case .
neutral	the staff were helpful when i called to speak about the problem but offered me nothing to compensate my trouble .
neutral	it is fair to say i had a bad_experience with the company and will be giving them another chance next time .
neutral	the site ( and all of it '_s various alias sites ) listed the parts i needed as " in stock ", but after_placing the order i was informed that the part was actually not in stock .
neutral	backorders were not possible and the order was cancelled and refunded .
neutral	i subsequently checked some of the other_sites in this family and they still listed the item as " in stock " even after my order was cancelled .
neutral	clearly there is either lag or hyperbole in the inventory system .
neutral	my glasses work fine .
neutral	i bought two .
neutral	i wanted the same frame for both , one tinted .
neutral	they were only had one of the frame in stock , so
neutral	i had to choose a different frame .
neutral	i need a prism in my lenses , which they tell me costs extra .
neutral	when i went through the website , it had no mention of a fee
neutral	for this service .
neutral	my second set took about 0_weeks to arrive and numerous
neutral	email conversations .
neutral	overall , the glasses are perfect .
neutral	my experience , not so good .
neutral	i will be looking for a different supplier next time .
neutral	review_integrity is unique at airbnb , not only in its industry but also among all internet companies .
neutral	this is a huge_win for guests as any intelligent_person_who is risk_averse will select a host with many good reviews and be fairly sure that they will get a good experience .
neutral	this is because on average_airbnb reviews are very accurate .
neutral	possibly only ebay can compare with airbnb as far as review_integriy .
neutral	many other internet companies like yelp and tripadvisor_cannot compare with airbnb and pose_severe risks to users and guests .
neutral	from my experience yelp and tripadvisor are_corrupt and unreliable and their reviews are junk on average and / or do not have the right people and right systems to handle what they try to sell to the public .
neutral	airbnb_invests massive_resources and very smart and nice people to ensure the integrity and accuracy of reviews .
neutral	they keep_improving although there is still room for improvement .
neutral	i would like to see airbnb add star reviews for guests too not just hosts_; similarly to what ebay does where both buyers and sellers are star_rated ( not just description_rated ).
neutral	this would ensure that each airbnb transaction is smooth for both guests and hosts and that airbnb would succeed_even more .
neutral	airbnb has no competition ; all its competitors do not have the resources , ethics , integrity , people and systems that airbnb has .
neutral	in fact some of airbnb_competitors , including well recognized_names such as tripadvisor , are essentially_scam_operations .
neutral	i am not familiar with vbro and other non pay per booking_operations so i cannot rate them but if_vbro and other were smart they would switch to a pay per booking model so that hosts do not have to pay a huge fee_upfront .
neutral	in essence_many of the recent reviews of angry_guests about airbnb are either_fake or the guests did not take the appropriate_precautions such as choosing a host with many positive_reviews so they get what they ask for .
neutral	another huge area of improvement to improve guest '_s experience is what user peter suggested on his airbnb germany review .
neutral	" if youre looking for a room the search is always pointing you to ' recommended listings ' but these listing are most often not recommended by anyone but airbnb - who never stayed - or sometimes they has not even been a single traveler staying there .
neutral	it '_s a need system at airbnb and they want to give all new listings a chance .
neutral	but ...
neutral	normally the word recommended is covering the biggest chance of a positive_experience - but in this case it '_s a lottery ticket ."
neutral	i agree with peter that airbnb should list first listings with a lot of positive_reviews and if new hosts want to acquire reviews they can just lower their prices .
neutral	another area of improvement for airbnb would be adding the ability for hosts to include_special_amenities_such as indoor_pool vs_outdoor pool , private_garage etc because many guests do_actively look for special_amenities but the current_airbnb menu_does not allow for that search while many of airbnb_competitors do allow more options in search .
neutral	airbnb has made huge_improvements recently .
neutral	i had an old_truspilot review of airbnb with 0_stars that you can read below .
neutral	old review below
neutral	-------------------------------
neutral	potentially great but lots of risks and headaches for guests and hosts that money just can '_t buy
neutral	airbnb is biased in favor of guests against hosts .
neutral	this is proved by the fact that guests are not reviewed with stars in public and their star_ratings are hidden .
neutral	this is a huge issue because encourages guests ' misconduct and abuse of hosts and hosts are reluctant to write bad_reviews about their guests because they want to keep attracting new guests .
neutral	many issues between guests and hosts would be avoided and prevented if guests ' stars appeared on their public_profile but currently they are hidden by arirbnb .
neutral	guests star_ratings are not shared on their public_profile to hosts .
neutral	having stars published on every user profile ( guest or host ) would also help the better guests have better experiences on airbnb , not just help hosts .
neutral	airbnb values transparency and truthful reviews that is great .
neutral	however there is a double standards .
neutral	host profiles show stars for categories such as check in , communication , overall satisfaction .
neutral	these stars are left by guests in their review for hosts .
neutral	however when hosts review guests and leave them stars ; those stars are hidden so hosts do not have transparent and full information about the guests .
neutral	also showing the stars for the guests would provide an incentive for every guest to behave and would save a lot of money for airbnb shareholders by decreasing the amount of time dealing_with guests hosts disputes .
neutral	hosts need to be rewarded for protecting themselves from scammers not penalized .
neutral	i had this guest from malaysia who was a liar , racist and a scammer ; i hosted him and his family and he took_advantage of me and my services for a few_days ; then he simply complained to airbnb and the airbnb case_manager anna canceled the reservation and penalized my ranking in the search_results .
neutral	so instead of feeling that they came to my aid , i was penalized for trying to protect myself from a scammer .
neutral	not every guest on airbnb is a good guest and airbnb needs to stop hiding the star_review information that hosts leave for guests and be fully transparent so each guest is reviewed both with written reviews and stars .
neutral	i feel bad that i could not leave a review or stars for this scammer .
neutral	another huge issue is that there is no transparency about rankings .
neutral	i have received over 00 reviews all 0_stars but one 0_star for check in and my listings sometimes do not show up in search or are penalized against other listings with worst reviews than mine and airbnb will not explain_why .
neutral	so guests looking for places cannot find my listings because they are not showing up in the search_results are they are buried .
neutral	another issue is that the escalation_level of customer service is not subject to review by the user .
neutral	if i talk to an airbnb customer service rep , i will be sent a survey to review my experience but if i were to talk to a " case_manager "; the escalation_level of airbnb customer service ; no survey will be sent to me .
neutral	so customer service is very good but case_managers are a very mixed bags .
neutral	they are usually very slow , which can be understood , and some of them provide horrible service and some great service , like julian who was amazing .
neutral	so it '_s very spotty and could easily be solved by sending out surveys about the experience with the case_managers .
neutral	airbnb has an excellent platform and customer service is often great .
neutral	there are many wonderful_professionals in customer service at airbnb .
neutral	i would have liked to give a 0_star_review to airbnb because they definitely have the potential and resources ; however some of their leadership in customer service and possibly overall is very questionable and that creates huge problems for airbnb_guests and airbnb_hosts and for their safety .
neutral	i have not been a guest on airbnb yet but i have been a host for a few_months and i have over 00 reviews from guests and my average star_rating is 0_star_ratings on every_category .
neutral	i have met some great guests on airbnb but i have also had a couple of horrible_experiences where i have received inadequate support from airbnb or where airbnb customer service actually made my experience much worse
neutral	i have met a couple of lying , deceitful , or racist_guests on airbnb and airbnb is unwilling to fix this .
neutral	i had a horrible u . s . airbnb customer service experience with jessica_h and delilah_b , who were rude , deceitful and abusive and their manager who refuses to speak with me .
neutral	i have noticed some bias on several_occasions from airbnb_representatives .
neutral	airbnb seems to favor_guests over hosts , now that there is an_abundance of hosts on airbnb , and women over men many_times if there are disputes_thus_making the community_unfair .
neutral	they are also sometimes very slow in addressing_urgent concerns , and do not always follow their own airbnb_rules but bend them according to " case_manager " is on duty so it is unfair and biased and there is no accountability_mechanism as sometimes they won_'_t allow or discuss complaints or in fact_retaliate instead of appreciating the feedback .
neutral	i have also been contacted in the past through craigslist from airbnb_hired people who claimed to be non_- associated with airbnb but were trying to push their service and make hosts_sign_up on airbnb .
neutral	one airbnb_guest from malaysia_stole from me , lied to me , harassed me damaged my property and made racist_remarks about people from india ( i am not from india but i do not like racist_people ).
neutral	airbnb did not protect me appropriately and i lost money and a lot of time .
neutral	in addition , airbnb_penalized my listings in the search_results so that my listings are much harder to find for guests who want to book in the area .
neutral	another airbnb_guest , an organization from oakland , ca , recently contacted me through airbnb to stay at one of my locations to do their work .
neutral	they misled me and i had accepted their reservation based on the information they gave_me .
neutral	after receiving booking confirmation , i found out their name and immediately learned through a google_search that they are involved in illegal_activities on a regular_basis .
neutral	this guest / organization later confirmed this in writing by messaging me on airbnb .
neutral	as my guests ' safety is my priority , i do not allow any guests who are involved in illegal_activities to interact with me or any of my guests .
neutral	i informed airbnb about this group immediately , jessica_h canceled the reservation , without my authorization , and then lied to me and her_colleagues .
neutral	airbnb never paid me ( of course i did not want any money or any relationship with this group ), and then blocked my calendar so i could not accept any other reservations for that date , fined me $_000 for the cancellation that they made without my authorization , penalized my listings in the search_results so that they harder to find for guests who want to book in the area .
neutral	they also told me that i was "_policing ".
neutral	as a courtesy , i also informed the guest / group immediately , after_consulting with airbnb on how to do it best , that my locations were not available for them for that date or any future date as they wanted to book additional dates with me .
neutral	airbnb_penalized me while in fact i was just protecting the airbnb_community and my guests .
neutral	i hosted a single_mom and her two young_children the day that this illegal_group representative was supposed to stay with me ; so they would have stayed in the same location .
neutral	apparently_delilah_b . and her manager were supportive of this group '_s agenda as they also helped them secure a more_expensive room with a different host and donated this guest about $_00 to book a room with the other airbnb_host ( and they collected the fees from the other host as well in addition to mine ).
neutral	delilah_b .
neutral	'_s manager won_'_t talk to me even after i was assured that a case_manager would contact me but she never did and then i was told that no one would contact me .
neutral	i regularly pay my fees to airbnb , introduced many new happy guests to airbnb and worked hard to make airbnb look good , regularly provide valuable_feedback to airbnb about their web_site and service and how to improve it , so this is unfortunate , biased , unfair and uncalled for .
neutral	delilah_b .
neutral	'_s conduct and her manager '_s were unacceptable , unreasonable and rude .
neutral	these products are top quility , hemp_force tastes great and is a top of the line healthy protein .
neutral	but i feel_like i was robbed on the servings .
neutral	ten servings for that price is ridiculous .
neutral	when i order a years supply of vitamins etc , they keep on sending me literature through the post which i put straight in the bin without opening .
neutral	i am capable of deciding what i need without being deluged with unwanted mailshots .
neutral	i have been using rebtel for quite a while now .
neutral	technology wise is great .
neutral	but this latest rates increase is heart breaking .
neutral	to say the truth i am looking for another service to provide me the same .
neutral	of which i found some cheaper on the market .
neutral	if the rates will go down , for sure i will come_back to rebtel .
neutral	autoeurope ( guerin ) provided a decent service but it was much slower to what i was used to when i rent_cars in other european_countries ( austria , germany , france ).
neutral	it was as if everything was in slow motion .
neutral	there were additional layers involved , additional people to check out and in , steps that were not really necessary .
neutral	overall it was a good service .
neutral	no_complaints about the customer service or timeliness of the order .
neutral	i found the curtain prepared with apparently good quality materials , but the design and implementation left much to be desired .
neutral	i ordered an acoustidoor to provide sound protection in an arched doorway between a hallway and another room .
neutral	this door needs to be used reasonably frequently , so i anticipated rolling the curtain up and down with the straps to accommodate the traffic .
neutral	however , the straps on the curtain are sewn down to about 0 ft from the floor .
neutral	so when the curtain is rolled up , it only leaves about a 0 ft clearance below the rolled up curtain , which means if you ' re not paying attention and duck it will smack you in the face .
neutral	.
neutral	.
neutral	or worse knock you completely down .
neutral	it sounds silly , but the black curtain blends in very well when the lights are off .
neutral	i don_'_t understand_why something that is intended to be used in a doorway was constructed with such an obvious oversight !
neutral	this problem led us to simply lift the side of the curtain to walk under it as needed , but that only worked for about a week before the repeated stress of pulling on the outermost hook with the heavy curtain eventually popped the screw anchors right out of the drywall .
neutral	so much for that , and now we ' re on to plan c ( a ceiling track to allow us to slide the curtain to the side when not needed ), which i '_m not very happy about because it will be much more_expensive and difficult to install .
neutral	i consulted with customer service about this plan c idea prior to purchasing the curtain , but they basically said " give it a try and let us know how it goes ".
neutral	they really don_'_t have much experience in this area .
neutral	they also did not tell me that their strap roll - up system would be completely_useless .
neutral	secondly , the velcro sewn around the edges to provide a good seal with the wall is a good idea , but again , not well thought out .
neutral	this is for a doorway , yet white velcro was also added to the bottom of the black curtain .
neutral	so now my nice black curtain that blends in nicely has a nice white stripe along the bottom that serves absolutely no purpose .
neutral	doors by definition do not have framing on the bottom , and there is absolutely no reason for this velcro to be there , except for the obvious fact that this company is selling one and only one product ( for windows ) in spite of marketing and selling the acoustidoors and acousticurtains as if they are in some way different .
neutral	the edges of the curtain are not perfectly straight , which presented some challenges when measuring where to place the hooks on the wall .
neutral	from grommet to grommet the height from the floor varies by about 0 / 0 inch .
neutral	even knowing this ahead of time and compensating , i was still unable to hang the curtain without it dragging on the carpet beneath .
neutral	and the weight of the curtain causes it to stretch a little_bit after hanging , which increases the problem .
neutral	item was on offer so it was cheap and it arrived within a couple of days using the free delivery .
neutral	i paid by paypal and didn_'_t create an account , but the name on the package wasn_'_t the name i put in on the delivery address ( it was a gift for someone_else ).
neutral	also i '_m sure i chose not to receive newsletters and offers but i '_ve had loads of emails off this company since .
neutral	ordered parts , received email_confirmation with tracking_information .
neutral	partial order arrived .
neutral	shipper indicated both parts delivered .
neutral	when attempt was made , no customer_support available due to system being overwelmed .
neutral	attempted again a few_days_later by phone .
neutral	system again receiving high call_volume .
neutral	directed to support_ticket .
neutral	information entered as requested including what appeared to be order number received with shipping paper .
neutral	after_reviewing email , realized order number different .
neutral	proceeded to fill another support_ticket , this time it would not accept due to one already having been sent .
neutral	confusion and frustration .
neutral	received the rest of my order the next_day along with an_email_stating it was sent in an_additional shipment .
neutral	had left emails regarding a question and was never contacted
neutral	арендовали автомобиль в париже на 0 дней .
neutral	сначала очень долго искали , их контора находиться на парковке р0 на самом верху прямо рядом с hertz .
neutral	процесс аренды автомобиля прошёл быстро , получили даже подарок - бесплатную аренду детского кресла .
neutral	машина вся с небольшими ссадинами , но при сдаче проблем не было .
neutral	одно но : при бронировании автомобиля цена была 000 евро , а при оплате / сдаче автомобиля 000 евро , типа с ндс .
neutral	вообщем докапываться не стал , время не было , но прецедент на лицо .
neutral	всем удачи .
neutral	i did not get my 00 . 00 dollar card from u people where is it
neutral	my towel rack base was cracked and would not hold water
neutral	the part arrived on time , however we ordered platinum and gray arrived .
neutral	iv used your company many_times over the past few_years , although your products are good an at a good price i find your delivery time not great sometimes parcels are lost , sometimes taken up yo three_days to receive .
neutral	as a keen sportsman although price is important so is timing supplements are needed not whenever they get there
neutral	took too_long to deliver
neutral	the service was perfect and i would 000_% recommend the staff at your company .
neutral	the product however looks cheap and is not at all what i expected .
neutral	there is no where it says that only half the trophy will be metal and the handles look poor quality .
neutral	this trophy is for a corporate event and i was given no advice on how the trophy may not suit this etc .
neutral	i feel a bit embarrassed that i will have to be presenting this to the senior management in my company !
neutral	courier left parcel with a neighbour as we were out but did not leave a note to tell us .
neutral	this caused three_days delay in delivery which would have been avoided if a note had been left .
neutral	google checkout didn_'_t work , at first , but i switched to ' incognito mode ' and it worked just fine .
neutral	bh support offered me to call in my order instead of using the online store .
neutral	but then i couldn_'_t use my google money .
neutral	oh well ... it workedin the end , no thanks to their support .
neutral	items out of stock , average wait .
neutral	paperwork side good , shame stock_levels don_'_t match paper , coms side of the business .
neutral	slow processing
neutral	they are constantly offering $ 0 and $ 0 coupons which is why i keep trying them but their ui is buggy and clumsy .
neutral	sometimes checkout didn_'_t work form and coupons and discounts don_'_t work so well .
neutral	but restaurants are good .
neutral	it is inconvenient the only way to communicate is through emails .
neutral	my question was not answered correctly after almost 0 days , so i went to another internet source to make_sure i was ordering the parts i needed .
neutral	i like the prices but need to have more specials for clients that get more that one room .
neutral	nice item and fast turnaround with free engraving but the shipping was way too expensive and i wasnt suppose to have to sign for it but i did which made it a late gift because i missed the postman on first delivery .
neutral	i will do_business with them again .
neutral	the only_thing i would like better is if they would send an_email_telling_me something i ordered was on back order or why it might be taking longer then normal to ship out my order .
neutral	when i did email them a question they did respond fairly fast which was nice .
neutral	once the order was shipped it was fast .
neutral	over all i was pretty pleased with my experience .
neutral	parts_geek , you delivered the proper product , however , some small attachment clips were not included as well as one bolt which i had to use from the old part .
neutral	these things were minor in comparison to waiting a week for my part to arrive , thus_making parts_geek a complete_waste of time and limiting the use of my vehicle as it '_s rainy season here in florida and i couldn_'_t go_anywhere leaving my vehicle not secure ..
neutral	i have used floraqueen for the last 0 months to send flowers to germany every two_weeks .
neutral	the quality of product has_been super they have had several issues of late with late deliveries and inability to deliver on time and once not all while i received apologies the last time the answer was to use my credit coupons to discount the delivery they could not make .
neutral	while up until recently they were very good if i have another issue i may have to look for another supplier .
neutral	premier business centers offers a professional environment for your business .
neutral	with top_notch staffing to help your business needs .
neutral	located within the luxurious griffith towers off macarthur , you ' re minutes away from jwa and the fabulous south coast plaza shops and eateries .
neutral	a few drawbacks though :
neutral	- parking can get $$ if you have clients to come meet you .
neutral	- conference_room time as well
neutral	- there are no name placards or numbers on your office_space .
neutral	having it would make your presence more professional .
neutral	otherwise , it '_s a great find .
neutral	i have tried to get partsgeek to send me an_rma_# so that i can send back a part that i ordered two of // i have faxed info to then to get the rma cause the net is not working for me // but i have not heard from partsgeek on the two fax sheets that i sent then today .
neutral	so there is where it stands regarding the rma_number .
neutral	a little_pricy on shipping , i was told i would get 00_%_off of my next order and was trying to use the code it kept telling_me the code was expired .
neutral	i didn_'_t get what i ordered at first .
neutral	it took 0 days to get someone on the phone , but when i finally did , they overnight - ed my parts .
neutral	however it delayed my car '_s repair by 0 days .
neutral	your processing was timely , don_'_t know how about the product is ' cause it hasn_'_t arrived yet .
neutral	.
neutral	shipped on 00 / 00 and not here on the 00th .
neutral	maybe by the 00th on 0 day usps_priority_mail .
neutral	what a waste of shipping expense !
neutral	sometimes , the site is the easiest_way to have food delivered with convenience and huge discounts .
neutral	sometimes , however , food never comes , problems_arise and i '_ve had to make a major hassle over orders in the past .
neutral	it '_s great when it works and not so much when it does not .
neutral	worth trying , but be advised that it can be a bit unpredictable .
neutral	the actual service of shipping the clubs to / from a destination is good and reasonably_priced .
neutral	the problem that i have had both_times that i have used the service getting the data entered correctly on the ship_sticks web_site to produce the shipping documents .
neutral	many web sites provide you with a "?"
neutral	mark to click on if you are uncertain of what data needs to be entered ... this is something that ship_sticks should do to help their customers enter the correct data in the spaces required .
neutral	too much shipping cost .
neutral	i went for the order , but i can buy the oil_filters at the dealer at a lesser price , mainly_because you charge for shipping from two different_locations .
neutral	good website .
neutral	easy to use but was let_down with the slow delivery despite paying for the premium service .
neutral	the product and service from lenstore is normally excellent .
neutral	however this last order took weeks to deliver rather_than just a few_days .
neutral	the result was that i had left the uk by the time the order arrived and i have been buying temporary product in and around europe for the last few weeks .
neutral	i loved all the options for cards and the shipping was phenomenally fast , but the website was awful .
neutral	i use chrome or firefox as my preferred browsers and the website would not let_me beyond the step one of the selection process .
neutral	i had to open the page with internet_explorer to make it work .
neutral	this was a major blow for my overall opinion of the site .
neutral	internet_explorer has_been routinely shown to have security flaws and prone to hacking , making secure transactions an unnerving venture , but i was in a hurry and your site was most reasonably_priced so i went_ahead .
neutral	i ' d give this a 0 out of 00 , i would use giftcards . com again , but only if it supported more secure browsers .
neutral	easy to use and good price structure , but carrier made changes and travlocity give erronious advice .
neutral	agent stated i could be reimbursed for carrier changes because i had purchased insurance : wrong , insurer told me not covered because fight change not long enough even_though not enough time to make transfer .
neutral	purchased additional return ticket at agent '_s advise and told to request credit for unused portion of original ticket : filed to tell e the rebooking fee ($_000 ) was greater than the value of the return portion .
neutral	overall , i would say this is a good service s long as you don_'_t have problems .
neutral	i ordered a tow hook cap for the front of my car because it didn_'_t have one .
neutral	it was about $ 0 bucks for the cap and about $ 0 for shipping which just seemed silly .
neutral	sure_enough it was when the tiny cap showed_up in this big ol ' box .
neutral	the shipping price was stupid and the speed of delivery wasn_'_t anything spectacular .
neutral	i '_m greatful that i was able to find the part because absolutely no where else had the one i needed but if i could have found it elsewhere for cheaper shipping i would have went there .
neutral	overall , it was aight .
neutral	i used to order a bunch of stuff from play earlier , recently it '_s been harder to navigate and too many third - party sellers .
neutral	keep getting e_-_mails from them almost on a daily_basis , though never anything interesting .
neutral	getting a bit tired of the spam .
neutral	i made a reservation to a resort hotel in maui .
neutral	it offered the ' luxury ' of the royal lahaina while being economically priced .
neutral	what it turned_out to be was an extremely outdated motel next to the royal lahaina .
neutral	we were allowed use of the royal lahaina facilities , but the room in the out building was a dump !!
neutral	it was layers and layers of paint over old paint .
neutral	there was rust around most of the fixtures and the room smelled of mold .
neutral	i went to the royal lahaina and upgraded to one of their tower rooms , which was very nice .
neutral	however , to be charged roughly_$_000 per_night for the dumpy room was ridiculous .
neutral	so , many more dollars later , we got a nicer room .
neutral	unfortunately , the initial room booking was way overpriced and essentially fraudulent .
neutral	it took two_weeks too resolve an issue i had with the product that i bought .
neutral	happy with radiator , but lines for same truck and new rad .
neutral	were wrong . i don_'_t think in this case i should have to pay return shipping .
neutral	probley would use site for basic items , but if i thought part could be wrong , i would purchase from different option .
neutral	jeg_er i det store og hele tilfreds_med boxer tv , men synes det_er underligt at de_ikke tilbyder sv0 og sv0 som frie kanaler .
neutral	dette_er_et tilbageskridt for mig .
neutral	har selvfølgelig kontaktet boxer om opgaven og_fået et negativt svar som_jeg_ikke forstod .
neutral	kortafgiften forstår jeg_ikke , hvorfor er_den ikke opgjort i de samlede total omkostninger .
neutral	synes det_er vildledende 00 ,-_kr pr mdr .
neutral	i tilbuds pris .
neutral	there are cheaper eyeglasses sites with a much_quicker service and higher quality products
neutral	love your prices !
neutral	love your products !
neutral	not happy with delivery time .
neutral	i ordered my ink_cartridges on march_00th .
neutral	i was notified by email that cartridges were shipped on march_00th .
neutral	yesterday ( april 0rd ) a pony express rider dropped_off my order .
neutral	maybe i '_m spoiled by amazon , but 00 days seems like a long time to wait for an order .
neutral	i must_admit that i am awaiting an electrician to explain how to set it up and use it as the instructions confuse me and " quote " the electrician as well
neutral	delivery was fast but navigating the site was a hassle .
neutral	won_'_t use it again until you make it easier to find things .
neutral	the items that i order was okay , didn_'_t know that it had two_separate parts .
neutral	wasn_'_t to strong .
neutral	this is my opinion .
neutral	good price and quick delivery , but when you on a diet , you want to know every bits of the information what you consume , therefore you need more info on the tube .
neutral	plain sticker saying that it is l - carnitine is not enough .
neutral	frankly there could be anything inside that box ...
neutral	we purchased our tickets online .
neutral	we bought the deal that gave_us an extra 00_hours for the same price .
neutral	when we arrived at the bus to redeem our online purchase the agent said sorry it just printed me out a one day .
neutral	take it up with customer service .
neutral	right , in a foreign_country with no cell service , like i have the ability to call customer service .
neutral	other than that experience the tour was well_done .
neutral	put off reordering by the expensive postage
neutral	great way to send payments , but they ask for alot of information if i want to send any sizable payment .
neutral	plus , the limits i think are to low
neutral	when booking on any website additional items like send ' me an sms ' should not be checked by default , this should be an option to the customer and not an opt out !!
neutral	!
neutral	steven tepper
neutral	arrived at the hotel at the time i made the reservation but was told by the hotel that the bus was full and i ' d have to wait for the next bus .
neutral	i successfully argued my way onto the bus because of a tight flight schedule but was disappointed by the threat .
neutral	isn_'_t this the reason for requiring a reservation ?
neutral	need to plan van capacity better .
neutral	i never expected three_separate uncoordinated shipments from multiple locations when i decided to order these parts that all must be on hand to do the installation .
neutral	this type of shipping method i would prefer to avoid ever if i have to pay a little more .
neutral	i was impressed with the fast delivery , but it wasn_'_t as accurate of a transcription as we needed .
neutral	music_magpie is a great idea , but its appeal is waning .
neutral	the offer price for cds seems to be dropping - the lowest_price i had been offered for anything was £ 0 . 00p until recently .
neutral	it '_s now typically considerably_less_than this , and the lowest_price is £ 0 . 00 , and £ 0 . 00 for a double cd .
neutral	this is bordering on the " it '_s not worth the effort ", unless you ' re selling relatively large numbers .
neutral	i have my payments made by bank_transfer , but it seems to take ages for the money to reach my account - it wasn_'_t even sent until 00 days after the arrival of my order , arriving in my account several days_later .
neutral	it had already taken a full week from collection for the parcel to arrive at your premises .
neutral	also , there is no feedback about which items are rejected and why .
neutral	it '_s understandable that items that are in too poor condition are rejected , but the seller loses out altogether - no payment , and no cd or dvd , but no_explanation .
neutral	a little information here would go a long way .
neutral	perhaps giving a clue as to what is rejected and why might help sellers to not send items in similar condition in future .
neutral	they get to keep their cds , and music_magpie don_'_t have to waste their time , so enabling their service to be more efficient .
neutral	so , the appeal of music_magpie is waning a little .
neutral	it needs to be slicker , and offer prices need to be realistic to keep it being attractive .
neutral	the glasses were everything i had hoped for and then some .
neutral	a product that is well_worth the cost .
neutral	my problem was with the communication , or lack_thereof , with global_eyeglasses .
neutral	although they performed within their stated window of delivery , which imo is grossly padded , my glasses seemed to have been lost for about a week .
neutral	from the email_stating my glasses were finished and would be shipped that day until they were actually received at the usps origin facility was 0 days .
neutral	continued checking during this time always showed the same message ; “ electronic information received ”.
neutral	after the first week of this message , i contacted global_eyeglasses and asked for a direct update .
neutral	the following_day i was told “ your order was shipped on nov 00 in the evening , as i confirmed in my email .”
neutral	when checking the usps tracking website , the glasses were accepted at the origin sort facility at 0 : 00_pm the prior evening , nov 00th .
neutral	since i cannot state with certainty whether they were “ lost ” at global_eyeglasses or at the usps , i won ’ t be too harsh .
neutral	the shipping is still global_eyeglasses responsibility .
neutral	a task passed is not a task completed .
neutral	again , the glasses as received appear to be excellent quality and stylish for the money .
neutral	on that basis alone they would get all five_stars .
neutral	the shipping and communication is the downside here .
neutral	ordered a set of inks for my epson r000 printer plus a pack epson archival matte paper .
neutral	i ' d been expecting epson '_s own inks and not printerinks ' version .
neutral	i accept that i should perhaps have looked at the website more closely , but re - examining the site , i still think it '_s ambiguous , and should be made clearer what you ' re ordering .
neutral	the paper finally arrived separately some days_later after dpd failed to fulfil their delivery commitment ( although dpd did give a free upgrade to a saturday delivery ).
neutral	in summary , i '_ve had better mail order experiences .
neutral	my order was fulfilled on time and no_problems .
neutral	whether i ordered the wrong type of brush or not , i am not sure , as your listing on the website was abit vague , the brushes do not quite fit the shaft .
neutral	when pushed down , the brush actually stops the mechanism .
neutral	the toothbrush is a vitality model .
neutral	i would like to try again , if you could guide me to the correct item .
neutral	thank_you
neutral	normally great service , however when i checked out an item had gone up in price .
neutral	great delivery service
neutral	my family and myself have used this site more times then i can remember , sending gift_cards back and forth across the country that by now easily add up to a sum of well over $_00 , 000 by now .
neutral	i , myself , account for at_least $ 0 , 000 . 00 just over the last_year , and it was the only web_site i had taken the time to review , good or bad , in some time .
neutral	which is tantamount to adding more to their standard fees as i make my living as a freelance writer .
neutral	i even received a personal thank_you for the eloquence of the extremely complimentary review a few_days_later through e_-_mail .
neutral	and then what happened ?
neutral	i checked the balance of one of my gift_cards a few_times over the course of a twenty - four hour period .
neutral	i have obsessive compulsive disorder and am type 0 bipolar -- i '_ve been in therapy and on medication most of my life for it , and most times i keep it under control quite well .
neutral	but i was handling the monthly finances , and while i understand that internet security is important and things like entering the incorrect password multiple_times seems like a justified reason for freezing an account until your identity can be verified .
neutral	however , in 00 years of using the internet , this was the first time i ' d come_across a financial institution that penalized you for using the correct log - in information to so that you could be certain you had enough funds to cover your expenses .
neutral	not only did they freeze my account and required me to call their help line where , in less_than two minutes , i was spoken to as if i were a criminal then informed it wasn_'_t " their " (" their " being the fine gentlemen on the line ) problem and they ' d send a report to " claims " but also i shouldn_'_t expect to hear back from them for two_weeks .
neutral	initially i went i chose this site because they carried visa cards , so i believed that the money on those cards -- the ones i sent to others , and those that were sent to me , be they physical or virtual -- could be counted on .
neutral	as i mentioned i suffer from mental illness .
neutral	because of that , the times i am able to write and make money for it are sporadic and not enough to live on .
neutral	eventually i was forced to go on disability and medicare .
neutral	in order to pay for my prescriptions and wide_variety of doctors and treatments , i pay extra to medicare in order to receive secondary insurance .
neutral	the money on the visa that was frozen had been set aside to pay for that secondary insurance , which is probably why my ocd and the memory damage done by years of experimental psych drugs and over fifty treatments of shock therapy caused me to make certain the funds were there by checking the balance three or four times over the course of the evening .
neutral	as a direct result of the freezing , i have lost my secondary insurance and will not have the opportunity to renew it until october , at which point , unless the current laws change regarding health_insurance , i will have to pay a fine for not having prescription coverage -- assuming , of course , i am still alive , as going off of these extremely expensive medications in the past have led to symptoms ranging_from seizures to suicide attempts ( and no the " customer_support " gentlemen refused to listen to any of these details , or put a moment '_s effort or even the slightest bit of mock empathy in his voice when i shortened it to , " i understand you don_'_t have time for the details , but if this isn_'_t resolved it will have devastating effects on my life for the next year , is there anything you can do or advice you can give ?").
neutral	an amusing side_note_: three_days after the call , rather_than two_weeks , i received an e_-_mail indicating the problem had been resolved and that i just needed to reactivate the card .
neutral	i did so , my balance came up , i attempted to use the card , and it was declined .
neutral	too frustrated to bother pursuing it , i left it at that .
neutral	a few hours_later another e_-_mail arrived , a duplicate of the first .
neutral	again i activated it , tried it , it was declined .
neutral	i left it .
neutral	the next_day , today , another duplicate , same results .
neutral	a few hours_later two e_-_mails in a row requesting i review the site .
neutral	so here it is .
neutral	i '_m not a petty person , and , as far as i know , all the good things about the site i described in the past are still true .
neutral	the devastating results over some security policies i disagree with are more circumstantial than the site '_s fault .
neutral	if it weren_'_t for whatever glitch that keeps spamming me with false_promises of a restored card that is anything but i would have given four_stars .
neutral	and really , i have used this site a lot , and it does give five_star service ... just , whatever you do , for the love of god , don_'_t check your card balance !
neutral	okay ... i admit , that last line was a bit petty .
neutral	good price .
neutral	but didn ` t live up to delivery standards . paid for ` silver service `- not met , but when i rang product was dispatched next_day - you go figure .
neutral	the rucksack i ordered was delivered quickly and in excellent condition but not exactly the same as the product image on the website .
neutral	maybe not a major problem for most people but i needed something quite specific .
neutral	the only problem i have with merchadise , is my shirt has a large faded spot on nose of dog . that was the 0xx , wife '_s shirt was perfect .
neutral	i went to send back my cores for my brake_calipers and it was going to be $_00 . 00 for shipping .
neutral	i had to take the cores out of the orginal boxes and flatton the orignal box and include the orginal boxes in to a flat_rate box with the calipers .
neutral	i hope this will not be an issue .
neutral	the orhinal boxes are still in great shap , but will need put back together .
neutral	i used reservation_counter instead of booking on line to inquire_about a conference rate at a specific hotel .
neutral	i was able to make the reservation ( no discount available , not their fault ) but with communication problems ( my name misspelled , my email misspelled , etc_.)
neutral	the process took a lot longer_than_expected .
neutral	great prices , but impossible to get anyone on the phone .
neutral	the price on the parts are very good , but out of the two different items that i purchased each one came from a different warehouse which in turn i was billed for two_separate freight_charges .
neutral	i also have item that need to be returned , sent me the wrong parts , so will see how well this process goes .
neutral	very good site !
neutral	i like the quality of the long_distance calls when i use the app .
neutral	i am also glad that the app developers are finding new ways to improve the app .
neutral	the prices are not competitive .
neutral	the pricing was good for my air_filter but about 0 / 0 hour after i ordered it i realized i needed two but i could not add to the order and therefore had to pay double shipping .
neutral	i understand the importance of automating businesses but not to the point of the detriment of customers .
neutral	thee are too many businesses who do what is the best to facilitate the mechanization the business at the expense of customer service .
neutral	nothing sells better_than service and smart consumers do not want pricing to the exclusion of service .
neutral	i really don_'_t know how your company operates .
neutral	i have not received my order yet .
neutral	my order number for shipping is 0000000
neutral	order was march 00 0000
neutral	find it now
neutral	good deal fast shipping but poor packaging .
neutral	ordered 0 coil_springs that were packed in a large_cardboard_box w_/ no insulation or padding .
neutral	springs left to roll around and bang into each other during shipment .
neutral	they had actually locked coils and were stuck together when received .
neutral	fortunately undamaged .
neutral	packer obviousy could care less .
neutral	i contacted them after seeing their quote for around .. $_00 ?
neutral	online .. for recovery .
neutral	i had an " internally " damaged flash_drive .. it was unreadable , but wasnt physically damaged ..
neutral	when i explained how the drive was acting ., they said it should be a simple fix under $_000 ...
neutral	once i sent them the drive and money order , all of a sudden advanced recovery is needed ... and thats about $_000 ..
neutral	why is it that most reviews im reading here are all saying the same thing ...
neutral	simple recovery didnt work , advanced recovery was needed ....
neutral	bought some safety shoes for my partner .
neutral	searched high and low for the right colour .
neutral	ordered them from work shopping , they sent the wrong_colour !
neutral	i '_m a responsible adult , i don_'_t need text_messages , emails and 0 phone_calls reminding_me that my payment is due in 0 days .
neutral	it '_s annoying as hell when you use your phone all day for work and have to deal with their distractions
neutral	i have bought a porsche pedal box rebushing kit .
neutral	ac / no 00000 invoice 000000 .
neutral	two of the 0 bushes do not fit .
neutral	this is apparently because the kit was made to fit lhd cars only .
neutral	this is not mentioned in the advertisement and i wonder_if you are even aware of the difference .
neutral	lhd cars used a thinner accelerator shaft and the pedal box housing for the bush was larger so i am now told by those_who know .
neutral	yours comments are welcome
neutral	it took a while to work it out , when all i wanted to do was order some flowers quickly .
neutral	i clicked on several places before seeing the way i had to follow a procedure .
neutral	only your real friends tell you how it is !
neutral	partsgeek sent the part out quickly , with free shipping .
neutral	part was a washer reservoir , but instead of the single hole for an external pump it had an_additional hole ( assumingly for an interior mounted pump ?).
neutral	i emailed partsgeek and asked if they were going to provide something to seal this second hole or did i need to send back the part .
neutral	they never responded to the question about the hole , instead they just sent me a return_authorization_number .
neutral	i paid to send the part back ($_00 ), even_though i felt_like it was their responsibility .
neutral	my credit_card was then refunded 00_% of the purchase price because they took a 00_% restocking_fee .
neutral	i contacted them again , threatening to dispute the whole charge and the return shipping fee and they credited me back the 00 %.
neutral	not a good experience , cost me $_00 for nothing .
neutral	no_clue why they sell parts with no support .
neutral	the price for the part i ordered was not any less_than other on - line retailers i looked at , so they really should provide a phone_number for customer_support .
neutral	great customer service was refunded within 0 days but did not get back the taxes i paid with my purchase but still would be out of luck if it wasnt for these_guys ... will purchase coverage again .
neutral	i ordered car shocks and struts , however ... 00_% of the order was incorrect .
neutral	the parts came in two deliveries , one shipment was larger parts , these were correct .
neutral	however , the smaller parts , were not the mates to the larger parts .
neutral	there seems to be a lack of quality control .
neutral	currently in the process of returning and refund .
neutral	we '_ll see if they deserve the three stars .
neutral	waiting for parts finally came .
neutral	post office00 days .
neutral	parts in good shape , fit pit perfect .
neutral	thanks
neutral	i have always liked working with frames_direct .
neutral	it appeared as if all was going well until they moved to austin .
neutral	then it seemed liked the their service went to hell in a hand basket .
neutral	my time is very very limited and when i deal with a business i am trusting and hoping that my " initial ordering time " with them will be all i need to do and that my transaction will be done right the first time .
neutral	i don_'_t have the time to receive an item , its not what i wanted or perceived and then i have to call the company , get a return number hear all the " we are so sorry ( we f && ked up your order ) excuses ", then repack it and go stand in line at the post_office to mail it back .
neutral	and then to really ad insult to injury is when the order comes back still " half assed " ( a term for not complete ) and you have to go thru the ordeal again .....
neutral	this last order i placed had one of the lenses wrong .
neutral	so i called the company , and after i explained the order snafu , then i get " let_me let you speak to so and so " ( well , why didn_'_t they say that in the first place ???).
neutral	so after listening to the music for 0 minutes i had to hang_up .
neutral	then i get an_email with a ro number ( why couldn_'_t i get that the first time ?).
neutral	so i sent the lenses back and " weeks " later ( it took a looooong time to get back , normally their service is fast ) they came back corrected .
neutral	now here is the funny_thing .
neutral	have you noticed how the plastic rubber in the nose_pads these days seems to last about 0 months and they turn yellow ?
neutral	i always ask in my order " can you please change the nose_pieces to fresh new clear ones ".
neutral	i always get a " yes we can ".
neutral	and guess what , i never get new nose_pieces .
neutral	this last return order i specifically even " wrote in my return order statement ( in writing )" to please replace the nose_pieces and i still have my yellowish nose_pieces .
neutral	so when i get time i will run to eyemart express here at the local mall and deal with a " human entity " and get some dang nose_pads .
neutral	my opinion .
neutral	please send a return merchandise authorization with the order .
neutral	i have ordered previously and always got prompt service at a good price , but sending back the old part is more of a hassle than it should be .
neutral	there was a sale for a light and i was not aware that i had to have a previous purchase with this business to qualify for the discount .
neutral	the information posted made it sound like i had to have just acquired another light and i now i was going to buy another ( after the fact that i had just bought one ).
neutral	i was refunded the amount paid .
neutral	delivery of rest of items delayed by 0_weeks .
neutral	i ordered this strut for my hood on my toyota .
neutral	the part was boxed in a box that was 0 times too tall for the part and had no protection on the part at all !!!!!
neutral	when i picked_up the part , the strut fell out of the box !!!!!
neutral	thank_goodness the part worked without showing any damage .
neutral	but i was wondering_why they decided to send the part packaged the way they did ?
neutral	with nothing protecting the metal or the cartridge except a thin piece of plastic ?
neutral	wow .
neutral	really ?
neutral	i would have expected better .
neutral	service was good .
neutral	however i thought 0 - day air freight was going to be about $_00 .
neutral	half of order came in 0 business days but bearings arrived by ground in 0 days or so .
neutral	also , i ordered timken bearings but the bearings which came in a timken box are stamped skf .
neutral	i understand there is some " cross selling " going on in bearing business but i would like to be assured of quality of bearings .
neutral	i have heard of illegal and inferior bearing copies .
neutral	simple explanations for these 0 items with assurance of quality and fair shipping_charges and explanation of such will make my experience with partsgeek very good and deserving of 0_stars if next order deals with these issues .
neutral	i like the service , but i always make mistakes when doing a transfer .
neutral	generally i either choose the wrong date or forget to choose chaps as the payment_method and then it '_s really difficult to find and confirm the mistakes you have made .
neutral	e . g .
neutral	i bought some euros and entered the date correctly and chose chaps , but i forgot to choose the reason .
neutral	this resets the chaps and the date settings and i only remembered to reset the date , so when i created a payment it did not include chaps and i still don_'_t know if i '_ve done it correctly .
neutral	i wanted to use my amazon . com gift_card but was confused .
neutral	they ask me to provide an autorisation code after paying by credit_card ...
neutral	no customer care service available by phone the afternoon
neutral	no notification if any change occure in your itinary
neutral	off to cambodia and vietnam and advised by gp to take malaria_tablets { malarone }.
neutral	gp would have charged £ 0 each for private_prescription so happy to pay travelpharm £_00 prescription fee for the two of us .
neutral	also ordered last_week in january some electrolade which i hope i would never need but stock when received expired in april_0000 .
neutral	i did not think this fair and when i complained they immediately replaced it with stock dated october_0000 which i am not happy about as i would expect at_least a year especially as i hope that i wil never need the stuff .
neutral	however that aside i would certainly order from these_people again .
neutral	fast , efficient and cheaper_than many rivals !
neutral	it took three_days to process the order .
neutral	that is way to long .
neutral	it only took the post_office three_days to get it to me and they had to actually carry it somewhere .
neutral	discount achieved and very prompt delivery made .
neutral	however , experience marred_by the fact the company did not telephone the day before as requested to ensure tank was unlocked .
neutral	luckily i was in when the tanker arrived ....
neutral	considering their charges , customer service is a long , drawn_out process , with some nonsensical rules - like witholding details from you of people who have defrauded you in order to " protect " identities ( yes , the identities of thieves ).
neutral	overall , though , you can '_t be without this exceptionally useful service .
neutral	it was easy , but there was a discrepancy in the price advertised on the website and on the booking listing .
neutral	not sure who is at fault for that but hopefully i will get added_benefit of paying more than_anticipated .
neutral	shopto . net are a very affordable place to get games and the majority of time deliver on time but for some reason i have found when i have ordered items in the evening ( after 0 ) i haven_'_t recieved the item .
neutral	after waiting the compulsory 00 days and contacting shopto . net a replacement was sent out and recieved within 00_hours
neutral	an uncomplicated order process excellent price but marred slightly by very slow delivery
neutral	i paid_extra postage so that the giftcard would arrive in time for a birthday .
neutral	i made the order on a thursday and the giftcard never left the facility until the next tuesday .
neutral	my niece did not receive the card until friday , which was too_late for her_birthday ( monday ).
neutral	kind of ridiculous .
neutral	i will stick with amazon from now on .
neutral	thanks
neutral	over all good prices , customer service could be better .
neutral	when salesman tells you something and then dont never do it , it gets old .
neutral	but over all good review .
neutral	i order a part 0_weeks_ago it said it would be here 0 we eeks ago another part i ordered came within a week and it said the same time frame .
neutral	i received this item 00 days after the order was placed .
neutral	the feedback i received : it was not in stock when i ordered .
neutral	initial tech seamed more to try to put the fear of problems into you , and promised to help with insurance adjuster , only to never return any of my calls or texts to either number he had , and in the end didn_'_t get insurance help for the damages ( but i dont think he would have helped anyways on that ).
neutral	while the service was completed in a timely_manner the rush the guys had caused several things to get over looked such as the caulk they used to seal gaps was all over the place in gobs on the side of my house and i spent a week scraping them off .
neutral	the larger gap by my air_conditioning was filled with large_amounts of silicon which the rats came back and chewed through .
neutral	the followup to remove traps and one way exit the following week never happened , and it took 0 emails and was the 0rd call before someone was able to get that scheduled for me ( over a full month after service .)
neutral	some of the repairs to the house for the holes look spotty and one is already looking like it is going to come_back apart ( these_guys aren_'_t in construction obviously ).
neutral	all in all i think i should have just lived with the rats and payed the 00 bucks they charge just to remove the raccoon that started all this .
neutral	0000 dollars later and the rats are back just doesn_'_t instill any satisfaction .
neutral	was in a big debate if i should give 0 or 0_stars nothing warrants any more than that for sure as the only_thing that happened fast after they did the job was the collection person .
neutral	i love priceline , i really do .
neutral	i appreciate the fact that i '_ve gotten some great deals on hotels , flights , & rental_cars over the last 00 or so years .
neutral	the bidding is fun to me .
neutral	i don_'_t want them to go away , ever , & i will_continue to recommend them to others ( with warnings ).
neutral	but ...
neutral	0 main issues .
neutral	0 : it '_s literally impossible to speak to anyone on the phone .
neutral	this scares the hell out of me , especially when i '_ve run_into an issue while trying to bid a flight .
neutral	i don_'_t want to wait for an_email response when i '_m in the middle of something , i desire immediate help .
neutral	the picture of the smiling lady with a headset on implying " i '_m ready to take your call here at customer service " is very deceiving .
neutral	0 : priceline would take a huge step in calming anxiety among hotel bidders if they would simply allow us to name # of beds , bed type , & smoking / non_- smoking .
neutral	i ' d probably be more flexible in price if i had those choices .
neutral	in the past , i '_ve had to share a bed with my 00 - yr - old daughter ( i '_m the dad -- a little uncomfortable ), & been forced into a smoking_room ( i '_m very allergic to smoke ) because the hotels were inflexible ( some are flexible , though ).
neutral	if the hotels don_'_t agree on any of those points , fine , but i '_m sure a lot would .
neutral	adding these options to their customer service would definately increase their business , & ease bidding anxiety .
neutral	unfortunately , priceline doesn_'_t seem interested in even trying to deal with these issues .
neutral	so , try priceline , but remember i warned you about these things !
neutral	paul in covington , ky
neutral	received the tv within a couple of days , the box that it came in was ' tatty ' not even wrapped in brown_paper it was ovious that it had been returned by somebody_else !
neutral	on opening i found that the stand had been fitted before and the screws over tightened therefore only two of the four were holding ( i had to modify to make stronge enough .)
neutral	i thought about sending it back but as we were leaving the next_day for a trip in our caravan , and this model had been removed from the web_site , decided to keep it .
neutral	the tv works well with a good picture and the sound is not to ' tinny '
neutral	this is the first time that i have used bookit but i have used other travel sites .
neutral	i found the best price for the hotel that we wanted to stay in for our panama_city beach vacation , booked it , and waited for a email_confirmation .
neutral	i used paypal for payment and recieved their confirmation .
neutral	i then called the customer service number and was asked for my email address .
neutral	i gave this to the agent and she stated that the reservation did not go through and for me to go back to paypal for my refund .
neutral	i didn_'_t like this answer and stated that this was my first experience and what else could she do to correct the situation .
neutral	like a robot , she repeated that there was no reservation and to contact paypal for reimbursement .
neutral	i got off the phone with her , confirmed that paypal had indeed charged my account and called back .
neutral	this time the agent inquired of my phone_number used on the reservation and , in fact the reservation was made and she then gave_me the booking number that i used to access the reservation .
neutral	i have received the email_confirmation today ( monday ) from the reservation made on friday .
neutral	i was glad that i called back but was disappointed that the first agent gave false_information that would have caused me to double book and double pay .
neutral	0_stars is the best that i can give with this experience .
neutral	perhaps the next one will be better .
neutral	i '_ve been a member since 0000 and have seen both the increase in source material and the increase in price .
neutral	the yearly cost is now approximately 0 times the initial yearly fee for access to the same data files though those files have improved both in content and accessibility .
neutral	however , the price increase may be driven somewhat by what appears to be a giant advertising program now being used by ancestry . com .
neutral	this advertising program , which frequently offers free_trial access to potential new members , tends to bog down access for existing members .
neutral	i have noted over time that turn - around queries become very sluggish after advertisements have been aired containing an offer for trial free access .
neutral	trial memberships involving free access should not be to the detriment of access by paid members .
neutral	finally , using required emails ( for membership ) for purposes of frequent advertisements is annoying and in bad_taste .
neutral	provide a means for existing members to turn off advertisements if they desire .
neutral	beyond the above , there is no way we could have produced our family_history books without access to the large source references provided by ancestry . com .
neutral	keep it coming but be_careful about costs .
neutral	i have friends that are avoiding membership simply because of the high yearly fees now being applied .
neutral	i ordered my part and did not receive an_email with my order number , i tried_calling and no answer , i sent email after email and not response .
neutral	they state in their policy no refunds or returns .
neutral	so i started sweating it , but i did get my part and it worked_fine .
neutral	due to this lack of response and no refund or return business model , i will never purchase from them again , too risky for me .
neutral	the car we had , a vw polo had a " no key " problem that i hope gets fixed .
neutral	when i went to start the car , at times the car did not sence the key & would immediately shut_down after it started .
neutral	it took 0 - 0 times of starting before it took .
neutral	i also opted for the gas_tank empty option for the first ( and last ) time of my life .
neutral	i can see where it makes money for the company but i will never do that again .
neutral	get something if its on special / cheaper_than a supermarket but its not going to be any better quality .
neutral	annoying the way once you make an order they don_'_t take the money off your card until 00_hours before dispatch .
neutral	very inconvenient timing !
neutral	great thing about the site is the information .
neutral	bad thing about the site is you are paying a monthly_fee but you still have to pay to get up - dates credit_reports .
neutral	give your customers a break .
neutral	the booking experience was as expected and comparable to others .
neutral	nothing exceptionally bad and nothing exceptionally good about it .
neutral	however , i did miss the notation that my credit_card is charged upon booking rather_than at the actual stay .
neutral	did not like that at all and i find that to be highly unusual for the industry .
neutral	had i realized that , i may have searched other venues to book .
neutral	also , this trustpilot review mentions nothing at all about what i am reviewing !
neutral	should you not refer to the booking in some manner ?
neutral	the hat is something my dad wanted all his life .
neutral	he didn_'_t know you could buy one without going to the masters .
neutral	but i thought i ordered the signature green hat and it was blue .
neutral	ok but not exactly_what he wanted .
neutral	he still wears it every day thpugh
neutral	they said they ' d ship " another " of the missing part .
neutral	i '_ll give a better rating when it comes .
neutral	was no way or how to add a simple note when ordering .
neutral	like : no signature required .
neutral	i have tried to contact them by phone and to no_avail .
neutral	i have tried to contact them through e_-_mail and they just tell me to send them back in a automated email .
neutral	not unhappy with the mirrors , just disappointed that there is no way to get a hold of a person to tell them that its wrong .
neutral	the trophy was good , wish it had been in burgundy , also wish there were more volleyball figure options .
neutral	maybe one with a female player .
neutral	plants looked very healthy but in the shipping process the trunk of the plants became damaged when they came out of there pots leaving the plant hanging with the root ball exposed and no dirt plants were straped in the box one at each end leaving one plant upside_down at all times hence the situation
neutral	so basically i have some good and bad_experience with wimdu .
neutral	the good experience is that you can find some great deals there and most of the hosts are nice and helpful people .
neutral	they have flats in many european cities and mostly well located , sometimes furnished like 0 o 0_star hotels .
neutral	the bad_experience is that if something_goes_wrong , don_'_t expect too much help from their customer service , because you '_ll not receive it .
neutral	they ' re not working in the evenings , they always state that " it '_s the owners responsibility " and finally if you already found out that the flat rules are not what you paid for ( the owners asks hefty extra_charges ) you cannot quit because they already have your money .
neutral	so either you pay extra or you lose all .
neutral	just be cautious and always before send an e_-_mail to the owner asking " how much will i really pay " as then you at_least have some proof in case of disagreement .
neutral	overall , the stay was a pleasant_experience .
neutral	the staff is very friendly .
neutral	i was greated as if i was expected .
neutral	the hotel and the room is comfortable and clean and looks as if it has_been remodled recently .
neutral	the breakfast is continental and is satisfictory .
neutral	the only_negative , is the short shower_head .
neutral	i am a taller man and had to use some flexability in order to get the water over my head .
neutral	there is some noise from the freeway , but if you are like me and from a large city , no big_deal .
neutral	i recommend this hotel for the budget minded traveler .
neutral	i was offered $_00 , 000 for an infiniti with 00 , 000 .
neutral	they saw one little scratch on the crome bumper money off , decale on the trunk , money off .
neutral	i was ready to tell the manager to forget it .
neutral	my car was worth a lot more than i was paid , but , i had no place to keep a third car except put it in storage .
neutral	if you have time sell it yourself !
neutral	excellant service for those folks that cannot walk well or have trouble getting around .
neutral	the bus takes those people directly to the gate with little mobility issues .
neutral	i on the other hand have no mobility issues and with my handicap plaque , can park in short_term_parking and walk the 000 feet to the terminal entrance and the cost will be only $_00 . 00 per day .
neutral	a little more than your service but still much_cheaper_than long_term_parking .
neutral	for me , i do see a benefit .
neutral	for those not able to get around as well , there is a benefit .
neutral	p . s .
neutral	your lot is in such a secluded spot .
neutral	the area is dark and dingy and leads one to believe that area at newark_airport is crime riddled .
neutral	would not be very hospitable to single woman_who are traveling alone .
neutral	p . p . s .
neutral	my car was not waiting fro me even_though i spoke to the same person twice while waiting for my luggage .
neutral	the bus didn_'_t take off back to the lot as quickly as i would have liked either .
neutral	the dispatcher didn_'_t acknowledge the driver when he asked if he could leave the terminal , so the driver waited a few more minutes and asked again , wasting more time .
neutral	this very well may not be a viable option for me .
neutral	more options on the colors in every frame masks
neutral	service was great , price was great .
neutral	however got banana flavoured why protein and although it mixed well the taste is horrible compared to competitors , i wont be using it again for that reason
neutral	the book and the pice was ok but seriously the shipping took a really long time .
neutral	like i say i found this website very easy to follow and to complete the booking .
neutral	i found all the info i required and could easily compare hotels .
neutral	when it came to booking it was pretty seem less and confirmation was informative .
neutral	only issue i had was when i arrived at hotel , the hotel had not reserved the two apartments i had originally booked and had to put some of us into a hotel_room and not self catering as requested !
neutral	both products shipped ( separately ) arrived with damage to the packages .
neutral	shocks were shipped without padding .
neutral	packages had numerous holes in the cardboard_boxes .
neutral	no parts fell through the open holes in the packaging ; luckily .
neutral	brake_pads box had been previously opened before shipping and not properly resealed .
neutral	pads were floating loosely in the larger shipping box .
neutral	pads arrived undamaged - tough to hurt them .
neutral	overall : probably will select a separate company for future orders unless there is a great price difference .
neutral	the order took a week to get delivered
neutral	wires and pluges in one box shipping
neutral	$ 0 . 00 wire
neutral	$_000 pluges
neutral	i had not expected the supplier to make delivery on the very last day quoted on his delivery timeframe .
neutral	adding in boilerjuice '_s few_days to arrange supplier , it makes for a very long delivery timescale .
neutral	it also meant having to turn off central_heating on two of the coldest days of the winter , awaiting the oil to arrive .
neutral	meanwhile , payment had been taken up front .
neutral	i shall bear that in mind for next time .
neutral	ordered two window_regulators for my car and the nuts were missing for one of them .
neutral	prices about the same as walmart with shipping_costs .
neutral	however , convenience of not having to go to walmart is a plus .
neutral	i asked that product be delivered without requiring a signature , because we have to pick_up mail from a kiosk .
neutral	that didn_'_t happen , so i had to go to the post_office to pick_up my meds .
neutral	thus , no attention to detail , so if i have to go out to get my meds i might as well go to walmart !
neutral	with shipping this simple plastic license_plate_holder was overpriced , and it should come with mounting_hardware .
neutral	shipping should not have been $_00 + for this and take over a week to get here .
neutral	i like elara but every_single time i order at_least one of the products is out of stock ( even_though the website just says less_than 0 ).
neutral	it was ok once or twice but nearly every order has_been the same .
neutral	i always order a few products and end out waiting weeks for all the products because of the one that they don_'_t have in stock .
neutral	thought rentalcars could find a decent rate but didn_'_t as it just found the car that was available for a relatively decent but not outstanding price .
neutral	rentalcars really must add the local / state taxes and any other options into the total_cost of the rental .
neutral	the state of texas charge and the rental center charged a lot of fees / taxes that it was almost_half the cost of rental the car !
neutral	wtf ?!?!?
neutral	!
neutral	there was no mention of that in the online rental reservation or agreement !
neutral	btw ... any rentals in texas must have a disclaimer that people should get the ezpass option to use the tollway system in tx but it cost $_00 . 00 for 0 week !!!
neutral	!
neutral	otherwise , you '_ll be penalized for going through tolls and paying interest / fines at every toll so is it worth it ?
neutral	?
neutral	money wise ?
neutral	yes and no !
neutral	it '_s outrageous that thrifty charged that $_00 . 00 fee for 0 week '_s rental for the ezpass considering that tolls were $ 0 . 00 each so it '_s more of a convenience option !
neutral	what a fucking ripoff !
neutral	!
neutral	also , the taxes and fees imposed by tx and the rental center was just utterly ridiculous !
neutral	was paying $_00 / day for auto but with all the taxes / fees added onto it , the final_bill came out to be ~$ 00 / day !
neutral	!
neutral	rentalcars should advertise that rental centers and states are just killing auto renters with their damn fees / taxes !
neutral	lastly , beware of the tactic of the rental company ... fill up the gas_tank before returning the car and have the receipt with you !
neutral	the auto rental company was charging more than $ 0 . 00 / gallon if you used their service .
neutral	it was cheaper to fill up the gas_tank at a local gas_station that was chargin $ 0 . 00 / gallon !
neutral	white roses a bit brown on the edges
neutral	delivery company helpful with date and time of delivery .
neutral	item arrived with some scratches : shown to delivery driver and recorded on his paperwork and signed by customer .
neutral	good product , easy to use but cut_off the one of the numbers on half the business cards .
neutral	there was not any appropriate warnings to suggest that it may happen .
neutral	i am not a fan of 0nd sites to make reservations .
neutral	this is second time in last couple months i thought i was dealing directly with hotel .
neutral	will start making all reservations over the phone with hotel desired as one of last ones i used stated that i would have saved money by doing so .
neutral	generally book cars through rentalcars . com and have had the same issue i had previously .
neutral	jfk airport is customer friendly for finding the rental_car depot .
neutral	everything_went pretty straight_forward .
neutral	my only_complaint would be the condition of the car i was given .
neutral	it was a bit older than i would have liked and there was a stale smell of smoke in the car also .
neutral	i was given a toyota_corolla and as i said nothing particular wrong with the car but i would say it was 0 / 0 years old and well worn .
neutral	non_ci_sono spiegazioni del dimensioni dei_prodotti , soprattutto quelli per i bambini .
neutral	ho comprato un prodotto che ha dimostrato di essere grande , perché non sapevo le dimensioni in cm , o per quello età sono .
neutral	è consigliabile aggiungere ulteriori informazioni sui prodotti commercializzati , come ad esempio la dimensione espressa in molti modi ( cm , età ), la natura del materiale , ecc .
neutral	la guida alle taglie esiste ma è per le scarpe , e ho comprato i vestiti per bambini .
neutral	sto parlando di asics .
neutral	naaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
neutral	our flight reservations to scotland were a bit of a disappointment in that we booked with lufthansa but ended_up on united .
neutral	the flights were uneventful , but we were really looking_forward to flying lufthansa .
neutral	i really feel that the way in which the flight carriers were advertised was a bit deceptive .
neutral	mps
neutral	apparently i could get cheaper oil approaching the supplier direct .
neutral	your service is good and quick .
neutral	i '_m always looking for the cheapest supplier .
neutral	i '_ve mentioned this before , in this household we are teetotal and would welcome further discount for loyal_customers ?
neutral	will i receive any feedback from this response ?
neutral	have not received my part ?
neutral	as a new customer just a note pictures of parts and quantity does not seem to match the description so be_careful and you can '_t speak to anyone live .
neutral	i don_'_t recommend this supplier if you are a novice .
neutral	no help available but the prices are good .
neutral	the service i received was no more nor less_than i wopuld expect any company to give me
neutral	good price however i made an error when ordering and needed to talk mto someone to try to see if it was worth it to correct ( if you read return_policy any returns for any reason shipping_costs are one you ) called number repeatedly and was never able to get anyone .. will probably use again because price is so good but will be extra careful knowing that if there is a problem i will be stuck with the part .
neutral	when i arrived at the airport to pick_up my car , i discovered that the amount i had paid to autoeurope on - line was not the full_amount required and that there were additional_charges .
neutral	having chose the cheapest option on - line , i was disappointed to hear that there were additional_charges .
neutral	this is perhaps a sneaky way for autoeurope to get more business - to appear as if it '_s the cheapest but then to levy extra_charges afterwards .
neutral	wish they would price match any competitor , the site is easy to use , the shipping is a little high but i usually recieve my stuff within three_days .
neutral	until something better comes my way i will_continue to use them
neutral	i would gladly have endorsed your product and cuntinued to support it .
neutral	the lip on the top of the capsule will not allow closing of the handle .
neutral	it is simply too thick , a result of poor design i suspect .
neutral	too bad they don_'_t work .
neutral	i don_'_t like buying from nespresso , their is no other choice .
neutral	bill
neutral	the 00 dollar minimum s / h keeps me from ordering from you on a daily_basis but i always kept mcm in mind when building an order .
neutral	the recent adjustment made in s / h has made it so when i do want to build an order it ends up being $_00 dollars .
neutral	i '_ll try and get in on the $ 0 shipping coupons but otherwise i will be using b_& d , digikey , amazon and local vendors .
neutral	i don_'_t think the last " code " i entered had any effect , either ( was supposed to be 0 %_off )
neutral	i like partsgeek but they should ship through ups or anyone but fedex ... this is not the first bad_experience with fedex i '_ve had and would never use them by choice .... but as for partsgeek i don_'_t blame them
neutral	i bought this product on a friday_morning hoping for next_day delivery as_advertised , it came monday and after looking through the website i did see the was no guarentee of next_day delivery , i would of liked to of seen the directions for taking the products on the pacgaging as well
neutral	park_cameras use city_link .
neutral	city_link , in my area at_least , are dreadful .
neutral	city_link lost my lens .
neutral	i had to ring park_cameras three_times ; they were apologetic and sent a second lens ( also by city_link , although they told me they would use another courier ).
neutral	i had to stay at home waiting for the lens ( it had to be signed for ) for three_days .
neutral	park_cameras could not provide tracking_information ( i asked why and was told they would lose their insurance [ why ?]).
neutral	i think this is a good company which has made a dreadful choice of courier ; i would rather pay for reliable carriage than have this shambles .
neutral	advice to park_cameras : change to ups or dpd or any other reliable carrier !
neutral	i ordered brackets for my windshield , lug_nuts , rims , and center_caps for the rims all at the same time and only the brackets shipped and i do not know where the other parts are or if they have shipped or not .
neutral	this is the second time i have had problems with national / argus in san_fran , they seem to push onto you options and recomendations thta you do not need , i do not trust the people at the sales desk in san_fran and will not deal with them again , everybody_else i have come in contact with throughout the copmany have been excellent
neutral	i submitted my claim with only_thing missing was the receipt .
neutral	i quickly emailed it over and got the confirmation .
neutral	next_day i get an_email_stating that the deductible was missing ; very strange because you cannot submit your claim without entering credit_card information .
neutral	i checked online and saw that my claim was closed .
neutral	i got no noticed of this .
neutral	i called and someone_who had difficulty with english took_longer_than necessary to understand the situation and only needed to look at my account to see what i was talking_about .
neutral	he ended_up submitting a new claim and using up my time trying to understand me , putting me on hold for over 0 minutes , asking me all the information that you enter online for a claim ( what happened , where , phone hex code , cc_info , etc_.).
neutral	once it was finally completed , the actual shipping , repair , and return process was satisfactory .
neutral	phone screen was cracked with damage to the bezel .
neutral	they replaced all damaged components and phone is working and looking good .
neutral	not happy with pricing found other at half price
neutral	background_noise at the location where the operator was taking this call was atrocious .
neutral	the computer system apparently failed to accept the booking for whatever_reason , and then to repeat all the information again was laborious and time_consuming .
neutral	i will avoid this service in the future and book directly with the hotel i am planning to stay at .
neutral	after finding what i wanted on the website , i sent an_email explaining it was the short arm of the awning .... then i followed_up with a call to place that order .
neutral	figuring we were " on the same page " by now , no_problems could happen .
neutral	i recieved a longer adjusting arm sent to me ( that i had to saw ).
neutral	i order alot of my supplements from pureformulas , they have great prices to include free shipping and products get here in a day .
neutral	however the customer service is marginal .
neutral	they have very little knowledge about products , their substitutes and most of them have no enthusiasm .
neutral	it is obvious that their managers are not doing their jobs .
neutral	kom_til klinikken efter_en skilsmisse .
neutral	havde et_par konsultationer med eva kocsis , men synes , at det_var spild af tid .
neutral	har tidligere i mit liv været hos en dygtig og knivskarp psykolog , hvor_jeg allerede efter første konsultation kunne mærke , at det rykkede .
neutral	jeg konfronterede klinikken med utilfredsheden og foreslog , at de gav et afslag i prisen , som_ikke_var lav .
neutral	i stedet foreslog de blot yderligere konsultationer .
neutral	jeg mener ikke , at man bør komme utilfredse kunder i møde ved at foreslå yderligere udgifter , men ved at finde et kompromis .
neutral	i '_ve used bondara a few_times and found their service usually very good however this time , there was missing items from my order with no_explanation given as to why .
neutral	they had been scored off my invoice .
neutral	i called to query and the problem was resolved quickly and efficiently however it was disappointing and no_explanation given why they products had not been sent in the first place .
neutral	usually very good , resolved , but at my expense .
neutral	delivery was on time , when i rang with a faulty part one was posted immediately .
neutral	no arguments over recommending them .
neutral	however , my first_port of call was their support email .
neutral	i had three conversations threads with three different customer service people and all i got was an_automated_response pretending to be a real answer , literally : ' thanks for your email can we help you in any way '.
neutral	secondly , the equipment was in one box and weighed 00kg .
neutral	the driver almost took it back as he couldn_'_t lift it and said they do this all the time - pay for one driver when two are required - and many items he delivers are not given to the customer .
neutral	luckily there was someone there to help .
neutral	it also scratched my flooring due to the weight .
neutral	surely they could split the box into two .
neutral	i ordered what i thought was a college algebra textbook .
neutral	when it arrived , it was the workbook .
neutral	i sent it back to them 0 days ago , but am still_waiting for them to come through with the refund ( which is their part of the bargain .)
neutral	we '_ll see ...
neutral	had to go baxck a few_times to select items
neutral	cxhose a villa big enough for the 0 of us but only wanted 0 flights as the older children
neutral	were not certain they were coming for the full fortnight .
neutral	when they confirmed they were coming for a week villa_plus charged £_00 to add their names .
neutral	it was also difficult to get hold of the right people in the uk .
neutral	really put us off and if we can get the same villa with someone_else next year we will do .
neutral	if you have a return you halfto jump threw a hoop to return insted of just returning !!!!
neutral	you even halfto pay shipping again to return !!!!
neutral	!
neutral	it was simple to order but when it arrived they accidently shipped me the wrong side of the side_mirror .
neutral	i ordered the right side but got left .
neutral	after finding the exact_same booking on hostelworld . com for cheaper it was a huge hassle to get the money back guarantee where they double the difference in price between the two listings .
neutral	eventually they agreed to pay me but i had to argue about with them to get my money which is ridiculous .
neutral	the part came and i noticed right_away that it was not concentric .
neutral	i have not used the part yet .
neutral	i cannot verify it '_s serviceability yet .
neutral	they should have a phone_number to call with problems so that you could correct any_problems you might have with a order .
neutral	but no you have to email them and then wait for them to email you back and now i have to go to a dealership for some reason .
neutral	this is stupid and if this is how they operate then i may not use them any more .
neutral	very easy to deal with deliverey came next_day as expected all that was good , the product is fairly crap quality , had to cut bolts as some were too_long make spacers and re cut damaged threads in it , as i screwed one bit on another bit fell_off ( not a bit i put on ) and instructions were for a different treadmill - but is good now its made !
neutral	i got the cheapest cable so there is not much in the way of good channels and to soon to see about internet at this point .
neutral	i had a broken trash can lid .
neutral	it is a stainless_steel automatic one .
neutral	so i ordered one on unoclean .
neutral	when i got it the stainless_steel was nothing more then siver painted plastic .
neutral	very disappointed !!
neutral	!
neutral	the service i first received was great , the car , which was a used car was ready when i asked for it to be so .
neutral	i was told that the chips in the paintwork would be done before i picked it up but unforeseen_circumstances meant they were not done but was told that i would be called with a date to bring it back in and since then , when i drove the car off the forecourt , i have had to constantly chase , i went back after a few weeks only for the salesman too do a patch job on the chips & give me a little bottle with some paint for me to touch if needed as i was told it would dry ok , it hasn_'_t .
neutral	there was also a very tiny dent that no one had seen and the salesman took a photo & said he would speak to the dent people & get back to me , i am still_waiting 0_weeks_later .
neutral	i am going to get the jobs done myself , if i waited for chorley_nissan there would probably be a new moon landing first .
neutral	you let yourself down & probably lost a future customer & recommendations
neutral	on saturday 00th_march i booked a mobile_fitting for four tyres on - line as i could not find them at any local centres .
neutral	quickly recived a call to set a date - so_far so good .
neutral	00_minutes later another call to advise the tyres were not in stock and could they re - arrange fitting for the following_day - ok realise that stock availabiliy over a bank_holiday may be hit and miss with distribution centres shut .
neutral	so wednesday came , but no fitter - apparently the depot had sold two of the tyres - which i only found out by ringing them , new appointment made .
neutral	thursday the fitter_turned_up at the appointed hour with ... the wrong tyres ( he did look at the tyres on the car to make_sure i was still road legal ).
neutral	friday_morning having heard_nothing i rang to try and find out what was going on to be promised a call back , 0 hours_later i rang again - correct tyres in stock and an_appointment had been booked for monday ... pity no one bothered to tell me !
neutral	monday came with a different fitter ( tim ) who noticed that the incorrect profile had been ordered - new tyres arranged with a new date .
neutral	thursday 00th_april tim returned with the correct tyres and finally on the car .
neutral	product seams fine
neutral	price was a little high , even_though it ny to vegas .
neutral	took .
neutral	little long , also understandable .
neutral	the thing that i wish was different was that i got no email notice or confirmation .
neutral	so i started getting a bit_worried .
neutral	i made an error in my purchase and had to find a needle in a hay stack to find a phone_number to contact your business .
neutral	i recieved the product in a timely_manner and am satisfied with my purchase but the struggle i went through trying to contact your support agents was enough to make me think_twice about buying from you again .
neutral	my issue is this .
neutral	i order but can '_t track the parts while in delivery .
neutral	my order was sent to the wrong_address and no one could give me answers or solutions .
neutral	i went an extra week without the product .
neutral	i was in a rush to fix my car and ended_up stuck for an extra week .
neutral	the delivery personnel or the warehouse changed the address given and no one could tell me who ..... go figure ....
neutral	i dropped_off my smashed phone at the new kiosk in des peres last_week .
neutral	i like the idea of person - less interaction and the kiosk seemed like the perfect solution .
neutral	pros_:
neutral	- sign in , pick phone , drop_off
neutral	cons_:
neutral	- didn_'_t receive call or email once phone was ready
neutral	- given wrong phone at first
neutral	suggestions :
neutral	- use the credit_card that was used to pay as the unique identifier , rather_than long serial # for lookup and save cc associated w_/ email ( square ) - usually don_'_t have a device w_/ you ( since it '_s getting fixed )
neutral	- show a landing zone when the device door opens , big orange dot ( don_'_t make me think )
neutral	- ui consistencies - i '_m remembering here , but it seemed like some elements weren_'_t using the same style and in some_cases the primary cta was green rather_than orange .
neutral	- put most fixed devices ( check the data ) at the top of the list , think " most_popular fixes " or something , then have the cascade of other devices and brands .
neutral	in all , it is a great idea and makes fixing devices easier , just would like to see the process smoothed out before i try again .
neutral	shuttles have left early leaving me to wait for the next shuttle , which arrived late .
neutral	when catching a flight this can lead to a critical situation .
neutral	this is parking location specific and may improve with other locations .
neutral	when returning to my parked car , at time i will wait for 00_minutes or more .
neutral	be prepared to build this wait into your schedule .
neutral	the site had some problems with its search_function but if you find out about some it '_s deals it is the same price as the others like hotwire and expedia .
neutral	they accept_paypal which the others don_'_t for airfare so that is a big_plus for me .
neutral	we picked_up our car at london_heathrow .
neutral	after a 00 + hour plane ride dealing_with an antiquated rental system is just frustrating .
neutral	i entered all my details on - line , but the agent had to enter everything again .
neutral	i used a company credit_card and so did not need the collision_damage waiver .
neutral	the agent had to rummage through 0 desks to find the photocopied insurance waiver form which of course had to be filled_out by hand .
neutral	again - information i had provided when i booked the car .
neutral	we were happy ( sort of ) to pay the extra_charge ( about $_000 ) to take the car to france - but the agent failed to provide the required safety equipment as_described on - line .
neutral	that could have been expensive ....
neutral	still , the agent was polite and the car was exactly_what we asked for , in excellent condition and very reasonably_priced .
neutral	so we will use them again - maybe they will be in the 00st_century next time !
neutral	!
neutral	could have packed my order better .
neutral	when the order did finally get to me there were soem pieces broken because they were just thrown_into a really big box .
neutral	the pieces that were broken were made of plastic and thrown_into a box with a metal fender the box was way to big for what was being shipped and was thrown around .
neutral	now due to the fact that shipping company left it without it being inspected i now have to buy another one .
neutral	i was trying to buy 0 pairs of glasses , one for my wife and one for myself .
neutral	absolutely no_issues buying a pair for my wife but i completed the on - line " contact us " form requesting some assistance and still_haven_'_t received a response !
neutral	this company is very slow in sending goods out and when you contact them are very poor in saying what the problem is .
neutral	" i '_ll look into it " is all you get .
neutral	they only emailed back after the goods finally arrived to tell me i ' d got them .
neutral	uh ...
neutral	i think i knew that , i ' d signed for them a few hours earlier .
neutral	i did get the goods eventuialy .
neutral	but i ' d give them 0 out of 00 at most for communications .
neutral	there are lots of better pc equipment companies around , suggest you use them .
neutral	i bought some fins and perscription mask from simply_scuba .
neutral	the mask lens had not been fitted correctly .
neutral	top_marks for dealing_with the problem and fixing it quickly .
neutral	however the mask should have been checked before shipping to me and i had to pay the returns postage even_though the goods were faulty .
neutral	in my opinion the supplier should pay to return the goods costs when they don_'_t meet basic usability requirements .
neutral	which was the case here .
neutral	i received a part that wasn_'_t the correct part for my car .
neutral	i '_m not quite sure why ...
neutral	i checked other part sites and it seems to be a problem with them as well .
neutral	maybe parts changed mid - year ?
neutral	or maybe some database error somewhere .
neutral	anyway , i finally did find a correct part from a different site .
neutral	but the customer service was good from partsgeek .
neutral	we had to pay return shipping , but got our refund within a week and they were very responsive .
neutral	being a writer and photographer my laptop broke i sent my laptop in for repair to squaretrade on december_00th .
neutral	they did send me my hard_drive back after they decided they didn_'_t want to repair it and its been 0_weeks and the reimbursement has not shown up .
neutral	when i spoke to customer service they said they could not honor their five day service guarantee even_though the 0 - 00 waiting period is past waiting for the amex gift_card reimbursement .
neutral	i '_ve been without my laptop for weeks and need to get back to my work but squaretrade seems unwilling to help out .
neutral	i just can t add menu hyperlinks .
neutral	i tried everything !!
neutral	!
neutral	the mangled condition of the packaging when it arrived on my doorstep left me thinking i had made a poor choice .
neutral	by some grace of god the actual part was undamaged -- how i have no_idea , as the box was crushed , torn and taped_together , likely by the post_office .
neutral	the price , however , was the best i found among all internet parts dealers .
neutral	that i did appreciate .
neutral	ordered stuff that took kinda long to arrive , and the shipping fee for an item is relatively high especially when they consider the item is ' special ' with extra handling_fee
neutral	i ' d have to say the ferry going out to france is nicer and much_cheaper !
neutral	returning from calais to dover i wasn_'_t given a tag to identify i had pets on board then en_route to board i was stopped to be asked if i had any and where was my yellow disc .
neutral	the staff then drove off having stopped me in the middle of traffic leaving another ferry and unable to move for trucks going round me on either side .
neutral	then i went to ask on board if i needed to make someone aware i had dogs in the car and no yellow sign and stood i '_m front of two staff who were chatting and despite seeing me just ignored me for the better part of 0 minutes while they chatted on .
neutral	only to be looked at blankly when i finally did get to ask and told yeah i '_m sure it will be fine , very reassuring !
neutral	never mind i did enjoy my vastly expensive drink in the cafe bar next to the two emergency exits which were clearly_marked - and also clearly had chains across them saying no entry authorised personnel only .
neutral	i '_m not sure what message that was supposed to give but it certainly did not instill confidence .
neutral	in short going out to france nicer ferry , nicer staff , nicer prices , coming_back welcoming to the uk we couldn_'_t be bothered making the effort .
neutral	can '_t be bothered to return goods as i can use them .
neutral	ordered the stand alone type and not the hanging crook type .
neutral	this seems to have been the regular mistake according to reviews .
neutral	the price has_been reduced for this type of lamp - you do the math .
neutral	products i bought are great , seem to do the job fine
neutral	the service on the other hand wasnt .
neutral	i paid_extra for " next_day delivery " and waited 0 days to get my goods .
neutral	i emailed to complain and asked to be refunded my " next_day delivery " cost as it was not delivered in the time frame i paid_extra for .
neutral	this was ignored and i got a generic reply stating that they have credited my account with the amount and i have to make another purchase from them within 0 months or lose the " credit " altogether ...
neutral	i wrote back to tell them this was unacceptable and i wanted a refund of the charge .
neutral	this has_been totally_ignored .
neutral	not very impressed with that and dont think i '_ll be making another order .
neutral	ok but poor delivery time considering purchase for over £_000
neutral	i am happy that i got my parts finally .
neutral	but when i bought them i asked that they be sent to me by a certain day it took another 0 plus days for them to come when in all i needed them by the date i said i needed them by which really upset me .
neutral	i order my wife '_s christmas_present and paid for it to be gift_wrapped .
neutral	arrived very quickly , beautifully wrapped , message requested on card , nicely written .
neutral	all is great until this morning she unwraps the present to find two price labels still on the box .
neutral	good job i '_m not a total skinflint but this should '_t happen not the professional standard i expected .
neutral	it was a simple mistake , o0_sensors for correct car however wrong model .
neutral	i am in the process of recieving credit and re applying for correct parts .
neutral	i had bought one driver_side and one passenger_side door_handles for my 0000_ford_explorer xlt .
neutral	when i had my transmission rebuilt i asked the shop if they could install the door_handles .
neutral	they tried but the screws were too short !!!
neutral	needless to say i have two door_handles that do not fit !
neutral	this site has unbelievable prices on quality products .
neutral	but it takes_forever to receive the merchandise ..
neutral	it would help to know where the warehouse is located when you place your order so you can have an idea of the delivery time .
neutral	my last order came from the west_coast , and i had it shipped to western ny .
neutral	it took almost a week to get .
neutral	iphone_app needs to be better
neutral	i was disappointed that there were no instructions with the kit when it arrived .
neutral	i had no_idea how it all went together , switched on , how you fill it , etc , etc i had to write & was told it was on the website .
neutral	all it needed was a note in the package referring to that & i could have found the info quickly then .
neutral	it is hidden behind a tab & is difficult to spot unless you know about it .
neutral	i can '_t believe its been about 0_weeks since i ordered two stethoscopes and one came with the wrong engraving .
neutral	i have tried to contact and send pictures and i have received inadequate responses .
neutral	i e_- mailed them back and have not received a response 00 days .
neutral	i first contacted them 00 days ago .
neutral	update_: phone support solved the issue .
neutral	email support was the culprit of this bad review .
neutral	a replacement chestpiece was sent for replacement .
neutral	--> upgrade review to 0_stars .
neutral	you all should improve your email support .
neutral	good product for the prices plus brand choices make it easy and painless
neutral	mcm has the reputation of having products that are not high end at all .
neutral	with anything i order from them , i just expect a 00_% chance that the product will fully work out of the box and then a 00_% chance that it will not break within the first month of use .
neutral	it makes me laugh when i see a sale on mcm and they think they are doing you a favor .
neutral	look , if i wanted to get a high end product then i '_ll go to a high end store but if i want something to just hold me over or just something cheaper i know i can fix better once i get it , then i '_ll shop at mcm .
neutral	i was pleasantly_surprised as my gift_cards arrived earlier_than_anticipated .
neutral	however , the process of activating the cards was rather cumbersome .
neutral	furthermore , my first occasion of utilizing the card via phone to pay a bill was very disappointing .
neutral	the card was not accepted on repeated_attempts as a credit , and then a debit .
neutral	upon_calling customer service i was advised that the card may not have been " recognized " due to not " showing " a physical_address .
neutral	i was guided to initiate another step in registering the cards so they would be associated with my physical_address .
neutral	the experience was rather exasperating but should be noted as a novel enterprise that will be accelerated as time transpires .
neutral	the tree looks quite nice and the lighting effects are real good but the tree is wobbly within the stand and difficult to mount straight , the branches are rather_flimsy and are not designed for additional decorations but will support small baubles should you wish .
neutral	generally this a real nice looking christmas_tree but it is let_down by a lack of sturdiness and stability .
neutral	booking was straight_forward although i didn_'_t print the confirmation at that time and then struggled to print a hardcopy later .
neutral	i don_'_t buy much here , but what i do buy , i like .
neutral	the web_site is horrible -- navigation , appearance , ease of use , etc .
neutral	i have to open a browser window nearly as wide as my screen to see the center column that shows the products .
neutral	the pop - up menu on the left to select the category of items to look for is almost like a secret code .
neutral	service seems to be good but i have a hard time dealing_with the web_site .
neutral	if the web_site were better , i might shop_here more .
neutral	i want to be able to buy multiple cards all in the same name without having to fill_out the name and greeting individually .
neutral	i want to be able to buy higher value cards without restriction on the number of cards .
neutral	the delivery was fast , but that was the only good part !
neutral	the quailty was like i printed them off my home printer .
neutral	flat paper no gloss .
neutral	the labels are just ok , with no pizzazz .
neutral	overall a disappointing experience and i would not recommend them
neutral	placed and order and added rush_processing .
neutral	almost 0 week_later contacted 0wd to see what was up , and was told the item was shipping that day .
neutral	website had shown that the order had shipped the day after i placed it .
neutral	took numerous_emails to get a full reply to a few questions i had on the order .
neutral	probably will order from this place as a last_resort next time , as there are plenty of competitiors .
neutral	good prices .
neutral	i have bought a lot from oldies but it always takes a long time to ship your order .
neutral	we recently ordered a part from you and found your website easy to use and the part came quickly , however it was the wrong part .
neutral	i think it might have been our error but not sure since we brought the other part ( same part #) some place else and it turned_out to be correct .
neutral	the disappointing thing was when we went to return the part ( at our expense ) and it was over $_00 . 00 to return .
neutral	in this day where there are so many choices to order from , i don_'_t find this to be customer friendly .
neutral	your company should assume the postage charges .
neutral	for this reason , we will not place any future orders with your company .
neutral	i bought some cards with them great deal .
neutral	i don_'_t care for the spending limits that they use , but they are reasonable .
neutral	what i really dislike is the fact , that i can '_t use a different credit_card , have to stay with the one that i used first .
neutral	i spread my spending among different cards so they all get use .
neutral	went to buy some and couldn_'_t use another credit_card .
neutral	guess i have to find another site to use for my game_cards .
neutral	ordered friday ; paid_extra for next_day delivery ; arrived tuesday .
neutral	capsule machine not bad , but empty capsules bought at same time are of slightly varying widths , so many fall straight out of the machine .
neutral	i have wasted approx 00 %, and at £_00 . 00 for 000 , that '_s expensive !
neutral	will buy more empty capsules elsewhere from now on ...
neutral	really pleased with the table but the next_day delivery was really misleading .
neutral	the customer service was unhelpful and offered no assistance .
neutral	all pages say next_day free delivery but don_'_t state that order has to be processed before_noon to qualify !
neutral	why can '_t they be clear at the point of order or at_least be more helpful when you call ?
neutral	000000000000
neutral	the only problem i have is the fragile parts i have ordered are not packaged_properly , for example outside power mirror for a 0000_chev sub .
neutral	, deliverer in a box with no visible damage , opened in 0days after delivery and found the mirror housing broken in 0 pieces !
neutral	only packed in 0 / 00 in thick plastic_bag , no bubble_wrap no other packaging !
neutral	i had to purchase a mirror locally to satisfy my customer .
neutral	i ordered a front , side cornering light for a 0000 pont .
neutral	grand_prix .
neutral	the part was delivered in a box that looked like it had been hand made out of a larger box , you could see inside because of the gaps , the only packing was a thin bag of very small bubble_wrap , the part was slightly_damaged but i was able to repair it !!
neutral	however the hard parts i have ordered have been packaged so well they could be air dropped and not be damaged !
neutral	im not one to complain but i recommend checking the shipping dept and see why the fragile items are not packaged_properly !
neutral	i am almost afraid to order fragile items , because i don_'_t want the hassle of trying to get a part replaced or my money back !
neutral	response time was good .
neutral	i rated the service 0 *** because my spare wheel was a bit difficult to remove and your mechanic had me do it by myself as he was not prepared to spend an extra few_minutes .
neutral	fixed my problem at no charge , as_promised .
neutral	customer service rep dave was on the ball .
neutral	service tech who retrieved the wheel lock from the glove box should have used a mat protector on the passenger_side like he did on the driver '_s side .
neutral	don_'_t worry , i '_ll clean it up .
neutral	the quality and the price of my prescription_sunglasses was outstanding .
neutral	they arrived quickly and were packaged well .
neutral	i was disappointed when i asked for clarification on tinting ofor colored lenses .
neutral	the first response was useless and didn_'_t answer my question .
neutral	upon my request i received a second response that answered my question .
neutral	i won_'_t buy anymore that you must use glue on .
neutral	mom threw them away after i glued a
neutral	piece of a plane to the table .
neutral	i have to pay to get the table refinished .
neutral	positive_comments : delivery was exceptionally fast , probably because it was shipped from within 00 miles of my residency .
neutral	the part ( replacement_tail_light assy ) was an exact duplicate , except as defined below .
neutral	negative_comments : while the tail_light housing was an exact duplicate of the original factory installation , the included wiring_harness was provided with different light_bulbs and sockets .
neutral	this may seem insignificant , but the connection plug for the wiring_harness was provided within that quarter panel at a position that made it impossible to reach without major body part disassembly .
neutral	since the new harness had different size sockets and light_bulbs , i could not utilize the old harness with the new housing .
neutral	to get around the major body part disassembly , i had to splice the new harness onto a portion of the old harness where it entered the quarter panel .
neutral	i was looking for a blackberry curve via a google_search and found one available from cash_generator ( welling ).
neutral	the mobile was listed as used but in good condition and with charger .
neutral	payment was easy as paypal was accepted .
neutral	the phone arrived a few_days_later but with only a usb lead and no charger .
neutral	the lead was not the correct one for the phone so i contacted the branch to find out what the score was . apparently the wrong lead had been packaged up and apologies were made and a replacement charger was to be dispatched within a day or two . in the mean time i had to borrow a lead from a friend to charge the phone and had access issues on the phone as in not knowing the last owner '_s pass key .
neutral	the person i spoke to was very knowledgeable and suggested what i should try .
neutral	this worked_perfectly as_described . i waited for nearly a week before chasing them up regarding the charger . i spoke to another person_who couldn_'_t explain_why the other charger had not turned_up but assured me that he had a genuine blackberry charger in the store and would dispatch it asap to me . the charger arrived a few_days_later .... again with totally the wrong lead yet again .
neutral	ok service apart_from the charger issue as who ever sorted the order out did not check that the correct lead for the handset was available / put in the parcel .
neutral	to date i have only received the 0nd charger and not the 0st one i was promised , meaning that it was never dispatched as_promised when i chased it on the 0st phonecall .
neutral	i would not go out of my way to purchase anything online from this store again .
neutral	bilder und bewertung sind nicht wahrheitsgetreu !!
neutral	!
neutral	my part was low priced , but the shipping that i paid cost nearly the same amount .
neutral	once it was shipped , it was shipped through usps and shipped 0st_class , which happens to be the absolute cheapest shipping the postal service has to offer .
neutral	my part weighed less_than a pound , you cannot tell me it cost $ 0 and some change to ship it 0st_class .
neutral	so_far , the service is okay .
neutral	disappointed that terms for toll_free numbers are not good .
neutral	i tried metrofax and myfax and both of those had toll_free numbers available which were part of the incoming monthly allotment .
neutral	your service so_far seems to be more reliable .
neutral	both metro and myfax , the transmission is a lot faster .
neutral	the toll_free service , however , is a big disappointment ... will that be changing anytime_soon ?
neutral	purchased a top and pair of jeans for my daughter .
neutral	jeans were faulty one of the belt tabs was hanging off and the sizing of the jeans way off .
neutral	the top was lovely but again size far too small . my daughter is a petite size 0 and has no trouble elsewhere .
neutral	everything was great but can you at_least include the fasteners for turn_signal in the future it would be great to have an not to call around for them
neutral	having shopped with amazon since it '_s inception and now with amazon_prime since it was offered .
neutral	i was a bit discouraged when i had to pay 0 . 00 for shipping for 00 . 00 two wiper_blades and then have to wait a week to receive the product .
neutral	i originally chose parts_geek because amazon did not have to wiper_blades in stock .
neutral	just today i ordered the same wiper_blades in stock from amazon for half the price and free two day shipping .
neutral	just saying .
neutral	even_though this time it took a long time to recieve my goods ... saying anything bad about hennie is like when starwars released the phantom menace .... even_though everyone_else was slating it because it didn_'_t live up to its usual awesome standard i had to stay loyal and say i loved it even_though i kind of understood why it wasn_'_t as good .
neutral	shit happens and as long as you are told whats_going on as often as possible then you can understand and be more forgiving .
neutral	i also had a little gift while i was waiting which was nice !
neutral	( although i did ask for one ... maybe they should do this as proceedure , a little token goes a very long way and repeat_customers is what seperates a good business from a great one !!)
neutral	consistently reliable service that i '_ve used loads of times , but the website is difficult to use if you ' re outside the uk , and if you '_ve got a problem customer service doesn_'_t come_back to you quickly
neutral	i did order spf 00 and was sent spf 00 - so the order was wrong but didn_'_t seem worth sending back - therefore my review isn_'_t the best
neutral	dive_computer was sent promplty but only after jumping_through security hurdles .
neutral	i paid to have this item sent urgently .
neutral	however , several hours after making my purchase and while at_heathrow waiting for a flight i was asked to provide a scan of :
neutral	0 ) my credit_card
neutral	0 ) some photo_id
neutral	simply_scuba seemed unable to give me any resaaurance as to how this data would be handled , what level of security would be used , who would have access to it or what procedures would be used to delete it .
neutral	they did not seem to place any value on the security of my data .
neutral	had i simply been reviewing this on the basis of my purchase of a dive_computer i would have given them 0_stars
neutral	why do i have to pay an_additional 00 dollar after i pick_up the car at the airport and i had paid already upfront ?
neutral	why not tell the customer upfront ?
neutral	disappointed that having received a confirmation that my 0 goodyear efficient grip performance 000 / 00r00v00 are to be delivered to the national garage in winchester ( very friendly ) this thurs pm ...
neutral	turns_out tyres .
neutral	have to order them from germany ..... no delivery now till monday
neutral	..... and no multi tyre discount ?
neutral	!
neutral	mike
neutral	ref t0000000
neutral	you have sent through a request for a review to the correct purchaser but you have addressed it to the recipient .
neutral	this just shows that either you dont_know what your doing or that you do not check what your doing when you contact customers .
neutral	either way it is a poor show on your behalf .
neutral	easy ordering , fast delivery but slow customer service after the sale .
neutral	i emailed them regarding a part warranty , after a week still no answer .
neutral	noisy upstairs a man was knocking a door over and over i think some did not open it , plus i am older cofe is number one but your coffee_machine had wrong pot ,, it went every where floor table etc , sad thing u have only white towels .
neutral	i went to this place cause convience of next to state bouard
neutral	first the watch was in fact the one i ordered and it arrived in great shape and without issue which is the most_important_thing .
neutral	i did find slightly better prices on the same watch but i decided on low due to the " lifetime_warranty " stated on the website which i found out did not apply to my watch after the purchase .
neutral	my largest complaint would be with the policies stated on the website and the fact that it doesn_'_t seem the company has any regard for what they advertise .
neutral	overnight shipping is in reality expedited_shipping which is 0 business days .
neutral	the 00 - 00_hrs processing which comes with overnight shipping took more than a week for my purchase and then only because i continued to ask about the status of my order .
neutral	in fact i was told on two occasions before my order shipped that it had been processed and after_contacting customer service the third time i received an_email shortly_thereafter saying shipping had been arranged just after the call even_though i was told the order had already shipped that day .
neutral	in the end i got what i wanted for the price i expected to pay however when anyone spends 0k plus on a luxury item that could be purchased at a relative price from any number of other_retailers , one expects the customer service to match the price tag if not at the very least make a cursory attempt to meet the promises their advertising makes and not exaggerate the status of your order or out right lie simply to get you off the phone .
neutral	you would think low would realize these reviews can '_t be helping business .
neutral	i for one would have never made this purchase from them had i been aware of this site first and from my experience and reading some of the horror_stories above ; i will not use them for my next purchase where i most_likely would have otherwise if i had felt my business was appreciated ...
neutral	i would stress however that the final product not only met but exceeded my expectations and thus is the basis for my rating and would have been 0_stars with half decent customer service .
neutral	you want the best sales come here i found the best prices so come and see its worth it
neutral	good shopping_experience except for item mentioned_above .
neutral	received shipment on exact date promised .
neutral	that '_s nice
neutral	when we made our reservation we were offered a lower rate that did not allow us to cancel the reservation .
neutral	we opted to go with the higher room rate because we were not quite sure we needed one or two_nights .
neutral	after making the reservation we looked at our confirmation and it stated the reservation could not be canceled .
neutral	we called back to question this and was told that we could not cancel even_though we specifically requested a reservation we could cancel .
neutral	i then demanded to cancel and did not want to deal with this company .
neutral	the agent we followed_up with elevated the request to cancel to a supervisor and we were told we would hear back in 00_hours .
neutral	we did hear back in 0 hours from the supervisor that we could cancel and would get all our money back .
neutral	at_least they did follow through but just be_careful to read all confirmations closely .
neutral	wanted to give them one star but gave them three stars because they did follow through on our request .
neutral	very general treatment with a lot of failing details , like more detailed_description of flight requirements
neutral	i received the parts & upon_inspection the brake sensors were cracked at the sensor & the lead wires were too
neutral	short so i had to make do with what i had .
neutral	overall ok with the service .
neutral	overall not a bad place , we found a set we really_liked and every other second the sales lady would wonder off like she was bored with us .
neutral	for times that would be so long we almost left to go buy from another store .
neutral	in the end we did buy the set and haven_'_t used it yet ...
neutral	i ordered 0 parts at the same time for a good price . shipping was a rip_off but i ordered them anyway . in just a few_days my order came in . i was surprised that it was just one of my three items !
neutral	next_day my next item came in . i thought ok , not bad but then its been over a week and my last item has still not shown up !!
neutral	!
neutral	the material and the workmanship on the captain america costume was poor .
neutral	to make the outfit wearable had to spend almost as much as the costume cost .
neutral	on the site the costume looked better_than when we recieved it .
neutral	have not seen a change in my credit_score in months .
neutral	received a e_-_mail saying my quarterly update is now available .
neutral	then i can '_t access the credit_scores .
neutral	then i call and identity_guard tells_me there '_s a discrepancy with my home address , you know , the place i '_ve lived at for 00 years .
neutral	i was told to contact the " professionals " over at experian , because they have the wrong_address .
neutral	no wonder the financial system is a mess .
neutral	wenn sie vorher per mail 0 % rabatt bei_einer hotelbuchung versprechen , dann sollten sie ihn auch geben !
neutral	sonst wirkt das unseriös !
neutral	the delay in delivery causes many still do not buy the healthdesigns because competitors have 00 calendar days in delivering certain .
neutral	already in healthdesigns is taking more than 00 days delivery dhl couriers .
neutral	i haven_'_t received my order yet , so i have no_idea how to rate my experience .
neutral	i do know that one piece i ordered was either not in stock or you could not ship it , so i had to find it elsewhere .
neutral	i '_m currently taking an online class for winter break .
neutral	i put the book on rush order because i wanted to have to book soon to prepare for the class .
neutral	i paid_extra for a 0 - 0 day shipping on friday .
neutral	i did not receive the book until the next friday .
neutral	the service was pretty good but not fast enough .
neutral	overall experience was okay .
neutral	navigating_through the site to find the items i needed was not very intuitive .
neutral	i did manage to find everything i needed once i searched with part numbers .
neutral	when i got to the checkout prompt i was confronted with another issue .
neutral	i was not presented with the cost of different shipping options .
neutral	i choose standard shipping and left a note in the comment section indicating that i wanted the economy shipping option .
neutral	i followed_up with an_email once i received an_email with my full quote .
neutral	a few emails were exchanged with long response times and my package was eventually sent without correcting the shipping preference .
neutral	my out of pocket cost was therefore a lot higher then other competitors i reviewed .
neutral	customer service communication was not satisfactory .
neutral	i was impressed with the packaging and quality of the items .
neutral	so i rated my overall experience a 0 out of 0 .
neutral	i would of gave them another point if myy last email was responded to .
neutral	nothing wrong with product or price , however was not despatched same day as the website advises .
neutral	hence arrived late .
neutral	it was packaged in an old box from a different product - could have been much_better presented .
neutral	i bought_battlefield_0 here and everything_went right till i came to the trustpilot to retreive the cd_key , since they asked for a mobile number which starts here with 00 i did that but because t hey where sendins a text_message from a foreign_country it onyl should be 0 so my number was invalid and i had to send my information trough a scann of my identity , the reply to this took ways longer that prommised but i did get it in the end .
neutral	i would buy here again for the low_prices and a reliablee support in the end , but it all ended with some friction .
neutral	the hotel was excellent , great price , all the fees explained -- just_plain perfect ,.
neutral	the rental_car service was just a headache though .
neutral	after being told that they were " out of cars " for me and the group of 0 other people with reservations i was loaded down with more fees than i could shake a stick at .
neutral	an initial cheap car reservation ended_up costing $_000 and the sales people at their desk refused to take no for an answer , if i hadn_'_t need the car ( an_hour after the scheduled pick_up time , mind you ) i would have walked out in frustration .
neutral	at_least it taught me to never rent from thrifty again .
neutral	well with this site i bought the product but the next_day i keep getting an_email to come_back and buy my cart i '_ll give you a discount !
neutral	this went on for a few_days when i had already bought what i had come to site to buy , when in this time of days i '_m tired of all the bull emails i get ... then i get the product and what a waste of money i get to throw my hard getting money n the trash !!!!!!!
neutral	this thing has done nothing for my 0 schnauzers , i would not put this on my web - site ..
neutral	so u ask me about my opinion on ur site ?
neutral	i didn_'_t find this website any more difficult to use than other travel websites .
neutral	it is nice to be able to see pictures of the different train types and cars .
neutral	however , it is disappointing that i was unable to pick my individual seat .
neutral	the best i could do was to ask for a window or aisle preference .
neutral	when booking the eurostar , i had access to the currently available seating chart for all the carriages and i could move about the carriages , within class of travel , and choose the seating that worked best for my group .
neutral	i didn_'_t get that on this website and the result , especially given that i am booking within a day or two of the reservations becoming available , was very disappointing .
neutral	i got the muffler at a good price but one of the brackets was incorrect for my vehicle .
neutral	i submitted an_rma form on line requesting that some one get back to me and to date no one has .
neutral	i did receive a canned email that some one would get back but no one has .
neutral	i had to pay to get a bracket welded onto the pipe so my savings went out the window .
neutral	i bought a mountain_equipment fleece which was of very poor standard for nearly_£_00 , but i returned it with the prepaid addressed label which was a great way to ensure the correct returns_procedure .
neutral	the item i bought was very lightweight and small .
neutral	but i was charged $_00 for shipping within the continental u . s .
neutral	i ordered a left mirror , received a right .
neutral	had to make a tag to get some kind of a number then wait for a responce then another responce , i tryed to call got a recording then disconnetced !
neutral	end_result was good , return_policy was long and i could not talk to any one !
neutral	box was intact so the bug shield had to have been broken before it was put in the bax
neutral	at first was very impressed , but when it came to having to print documents and then having to send them to the person where the parcel was to be picked_up from was out of the question .
neutral	the person had no computer , so that did not work .
neutral	then telephoned the help line who said there was no other way of doing it , i canceled and booked else where .
neutral	yet , had booked previously three months before and had know problem with getting a large item picked_up .
neutral	m y delibery is getting to long to be delibery i order more then a week_ago and i still_havent recived yeat other then that everyting is cool i like the page ease to find parts good job on that
neutral	ordered flowers for my girlfriend ’_s birthday .
neutral	probably should have looked at more of the negative_reviews before ordering .
neutral	i received the delivery when expected , but around 00_% of the roses were completely wilted .
neutral	judging from other reviews , it appears that their main problems are delivery times and quality .
neutral	for me , if the quality had been better , i would use them again .
neutral	prices aren_'_t great - standard market prices , including " sales " on some things , at times .
neutral	good variety of high - end pet products .
neutral	good customer service .
neutral	i ' d actually give them a 0 . 0 rating if it was available , but i thought it was more reflective of my opinion to round down rather_than up .
neutral	i get that you provide a good service , and have to make your buck , goldstar .
neutral	but don_'_t expect me to not notice the varying convenience fee , depending_on the price of the ticket .
neutral	$_00 ticket ?
neutral	that '_s a $ 0 fee .
neutral	a comp ticket ?
neutral	that '_s an $ 0 fee - and that '_s a load of bull .
neutral	it doesn_'_t cost your software any more to process one ticket over another .
neutral	you ' re just gouging .
neutral	i '_ve lessened my purchases from you because i '_m so annoyed .
neutral	i may stop buying altogether , just because of the hypocrisy .
neutral	tried to get in touch by phone as there was a question i wanted to ask .
neutral	tried , tried and tried again to contact to no gain .
neutral	ordered by internet in the end .
neutral	not in stock but gave a delivery date of about 0 week when it would be back in .
neutral	on date of supposed delivery to firm , a new date of 0_weeks was given before it would be back in stock .
neutral	rang first thing sat .
neutral	morning .
neutral	got through .
neutral	ordered another model and got a delivery date .
neutral	i was sent an_email which stated i would be contacted the evening before delivery to give a morning or afternoon time .
neutral	then on the day of delivery i would be contacted in the morning with a 0 hour delivery slot .
neutral	neither of the phone_calls were made .
neutral	stayed in all day .
neutral	delivered 0 . 00pm .
neutral	wasted day .
neutral	customer_services need to be beefed up at the company .
neutral	service is fine , although if you do your own shopping around , you will probably save up to 0 pence_per_litre .
neutral	boilerjuice are very clever in that they entice you in , with the possibilities of paying less over buying weekends .
neutral	in reality , i would imagine the majority of people do not save any money over a buying weekend and you would be better off doing your own research and saving money this way .
neutral	this will probably be the last time i buy from boilerjuice , although it is a useful start point for your own research .
neutral	in my opinion , underhand tactics , do your own research !
neutral	i like the website which is user_friendly and there are ample promotional_offers to save even more money .
neutral	i was very pleased with my glasses when they finally arrived .
neutral	i even found everyone i spoke to very pleasant to deal with regarding my order .
neutral	however i had to give framesdirect a 0_star because it took over a month to get my order correct .
neutral	the website showed a frame in the size i wanted , but first found out it was on backorder , then later found out that the color of the frame i selected did not come in that size .
neutral	this was a major delay and by the time this was figured_out , i was really desperate for glasses .
neutral	so i had to choose again .
neutral	fortunately , learning from before , i chose four different frames and had to wait for the company to contact the manufacturer to confirm they carried what i needed .
neutral	three were on backorder .
neutral	i settled for my fourth ( actually 0th ) choice .
neutral	by the time i got them , i was pleased , but not able to use them for the function planned , and had to use an_older scratched up pair i needed to replace .
neutral	lesson here is not to wait to the last_minute .
neutral	but getting glasses shouldn_'_t take a month or more .
neutral	i like that they have everything u would need but i would rather pay for ups
neutral	be selective in what you purchase .
neutral	first week of new season items in villa should have been checked before our arrival eg .
neutral	batteries in remotes for air_conditioning , safe , outside lights etc all and other items had to be reported as not working on arrival .
neutral	some not fixed before we left .
neutral	got to say holiday was great through .
neutral	villa in prime position and as_advertised , service in uk and booking first rate .
neutral	just little more care when checking villas before arrival would make all the difference .
neutral	the problem is the fee on the credit - card , which costs with a continuos booking a certain_amount of money .
neutral	is there an other credit - card possibility for switzerland ?
neutral	visa_debit does not exist in ch .
neutral	k
neutral	i ordered my belly pan which stated it was oem .
neutral	not so much .
neutral	it came literally rolled up in a box which took_forever to flatten .
neutral	the bolt_holes didn_'_t line up and the clips didn_'_t fit .
neutral	ridiculous .
neutral	you get what you pay for .
neutral	most things are worth spending the extra money to get it perfect .
neutral	i have used parts_geek many_times over the last several_years and have found the prices and convienance to be exceptional .
neutral	however , recently i had to return a part that i made a mistake on and i will simply say that the return procedure for lack of a better way of putting it was daunting .
neutral	when i finally was able to follow the procedure now i have to wait 00 days while my return is processed .
neutral	really the parts are still in the original package .
neutral	this doe not engender confidence .
neutral	the return procedure is such that it is clear that parts_geek would say we really do not want return !!!
neutral	0 with improved return procedure
neutral	not the easiest of transactions but this was down to the finance company used for the pay monthly option .
neutral	blackcircles call_centre staff were however most helpful and apologetic so i will consider_using them again in the future .
neutral	ordered goods saturday 00th .. expected this to be processed monday 00th and delivered next_day 00th as i had paid for next_day delivery . on the monday after 0p . m .
neutral	i decided to track my parcel and uncovered the following facts :
neutral	dispatched from tayside 00 . 00 monday
neutral	arrived at hub0 birmingham at 0 . 00 tuesday
neutral	again at hub0 birmingham at 0 . 00 tuesday
neutral	and again at hub0 birmingham at 0 . 00 tuesday
neutral	and again at hub0 birmingham at 00 . 00 tuesday
neutral	the poor parcell must have been dizzy any way it arrived on wednesday so only 0 day later than paid for .
neutral	had an ongoing problem with calculating the drop of the blind .
neutral	they were totally unhelpful , despite_being the experts .
neutral	they could see the problem , but had no interest in helping_me solve it or suggesting a solution .
neutral	eventually worked it out by trial and error , but they were strange !
neutral	blind when ordered was fine and came v quickly .
neutral	relatively easy to find the parts i wanted to order .
neutral	shipping was easy , but disappointed that a separate shipping fee was charged from each warehouse .
neutral	shipping took_longer_than i expected .
neutral	one part took almost a week to arrive from order time , even_though in stock .
neutral	wir buchen unsere reisen / ferien praktisch nur noch über e_- bookers und sind über_die schnelle_abwicklung und_das angebot sehr_zufrieden .
neutral	schwierig wird es , wenn probleme bei_der buchung auftreten und man telefonischen kontakt aufnehmen möchte .
neutral	( beispiel : buchung wird nicht bestätigt , der buchungsbetrag aber bei_der kreditkarten - bank belastet und dadurch die karte gesperrt ):
neutral	0 . steht nur_eine 0000er telefonummer zur verfügung .
neutral	dies auch , wenn abklärungen unsererseits getroffen werden müssen und man sich nochmals beim kundenservice von e_- bookers melden muss .
neutral	eine direktwahl zum bereits angesprochenen kundenmitarbeiter ist_nicht möglich .
neutral	0 . liegt das problem bei e_- bookers und sind abklärungen nötig , wird man nicht zurückgerufen .
neutral	die kontaktaufnahme muss vom kunden kommen .
neutral	0 . versprochene infos über e_-_mail kommt nicht .
neutral	0 . ist für ein problem eine mehrmalige kontaktaufnahme nötig , kann nicht_immer mit_dem gleichen kundenmitarbeiter gesprochen werden .
neutral	man muss somit jedesmal das problem nochmals erklären .
neutral	die kundenmitarbeiter sind zwar sehr freundlich , nur hilft dies für obige probleme nichts .
neutral	es macht es_nur etwas angehemer .
neutral	kinda_slow shipping was hoping all package be close together
neutral	we booked the man to come to our house to change the two rear tyres .
neutral	recieved a call the following_day confirming that someone would be with us on the day we requested .
neutral	00_minutes later a different man called to say that actually the guy_who covers our area was on holiday then ( why the online system let_me book it in for then is beyond me !)
neutral	anyway , scheduled it for the following week .
neutral	recieved a third call mid week telling_me nobody was in our area on rescheduled date .
neutral	did point out i had already changed it once because of their poor system but he didnt seem to care .
neutral	asked if he could do it 0 days_later at my place of work .
neutral	not keen , but th snow was coming_back and i really needed them changed and i have already paid over £_000 !!
neutral	i am initially informed that it will be booked in for friday , however , when i asked if he could tell me if it was morning or afternoon he replied that he might just book it in for the thursday ?!?!
neutral	he will book it in and phone back to confirm which day and if it is morning or afternoon .
neutral	no call came !!
neutral	when the guy didnt show up thursday i assumed he would be there friday .
neutral	which he was at 0 . 00pm just as i was getting ready to leave work for the day !!!!
neutral	thankfully it only took 00_minutes and the man who changed the tyres was great , just a shame i cant say the same for the rest of the service i recieved !
neutral	very nice seller , very nice guitar arrived in perfect_condition
neutral	but specs not taken into account properly for my custom guitar ... with no communications with the guitar company ...
neutral	living in switzerland , i had to wait too_long because of my adress that was somehow lost in the shipment process ... i don_'_t know how it is possible ...
neutral	overall i felt_like a lack of seriousity in the purchase both from seller and guitar company .
neutral	i guess i was an exception in these busy days ...
neutral	the feedback and delivery service was great .
neutral	however , i am quite disappointed with the optical quality of these particular glasses .
neutral	i had thought that being a brand named product the optical quality would be up to speed .
neutral	i spend an_hour a day driving to work and i had to take these glasses off after 00_minutes or so , as they appeared out of focus , and i haven_'_t had this problem with previous glasses .
neutral	i wear magnifying glasses for reading , and do not hav this problem with existing sunglasses .
neutral	not sure i would buy on - line again , as i would have picked this up if i had tried before i bought these glasses
neutral	i have purchased cooling_fans for 0 different vws from partsgeek and both cooling_fans died in under 0 years .
neutral	unfortunately the warranty is 0yr so i was sol .
neutral	at_least they offered me free shipping on a replacement fan for one of them and the other car i sold with a dead fan .
neutral	hopefully the new fan in my wife '_s jetta keeps going longer_than 0yrs this time .
neutral	at first the darn thing wouldn_'_t print anything it took too_long a time to get it started , not sure i would buy it again
neutral	the web_site did not move from one page to another very quickly and in one case not at all .
neutral	ordered some protein_powder which included free delivery .
neutral	product is great , delivery very poor .
neutral	- firstly , email to show product dispatched was from a completely different company with no mention of what product had been delivered or which company .
neutral	having ordered other stuff online , i could only guess that my product had been dispatched from monster but i wasn_'_t sure , the email could easily have been spam .
neutral	- secondly , the order email had a tracking_number so i kept track to see the progress .
neutral	the package was eventually marked as delivered but i hadn_'_t received it !
neutral	so i contacted the delivery company and eventually they got back to me .
neutral	the delivery man had left it with the apartment security office with no attempt to knock on my door or leave a docket .
neutral	not such a smooth experience , monster .
neutral	easy to deal with firm who offered a fine range of vehicles .
neutral	the one quibble was that they automatically re - scheduled my collection for the following_day when i sought to pick_up at 0 pm in rome ( the station hertz closing at 0 pm ).
neutral	it was not difficult to pick_up an_hour and a half earlier which is what i did .
neutral	at first i did not realise that the program had automatically transferred me to a time_slot that was grossly inferior and i had to handle it automatically .
neutral	better if the advice had come that i needed to check in before 0 pm if i took the plan offered .
neutral	took my order and then couldn_'_t fulfil it and it was for christmas_presents
neutral	two phone_calls to say both_pairs of shorts i had ordered were not in stock
neutral	the fellow that received the car at edinburgh_airport stated that it will be e_-_mail to me immediately .
neutral	however , i have not received anything yet 0 days_later .
neutral	i arrived at 0 : 00 and was the first customer .
neutral	i was told that it would take one hour to one hour and 00_minutes for 0 new tires and an alignment .
neutral	after 0 hours i had to ask about the estimated time for completion .
neutral	a sales_rep went to check for me and only provided updated information when i asked_him a second time .
neutral	total time in store was 0 . 0 hours .
neutral	i believe i received a good deal on the tires .
neutral	i did find one place with a lower price , but after adding shipping it was actually higher . i installed the part ( a glow plug control_module ) and cleared the trouble code , and everything was fine for 0 days , then the check_engine_light came back on with the same code . i beleive the part i received is defective . i noticed when i took it out of the box it looked like it might have been used , and was cleaned_up very good .
neutral	once steve , the md , had got involved the process smoothed out considerably .
neutral	i received my curtains within 00_hours of steves ' intervention .
neutral	i am happy to review my original rating and upgrade as above .
neutral	i ordered my curtains and was well aware of the waiting time .
neutral	the first thing that happened was that i received the wrong product .
neutral	the address on the packaging was correct but the advice note inside was for a lady in truro .
neutral	when i phoned the customer_services a lady apologised and asked if i would send them on to the correct person .
neutral	i had no problem doing this as we all make mistakes .
neutral	the lady then phoned me back to say my curtains would be with me on wednesday or thursday .
neutral	they are still not here and it '_s friday .
neutral	not impressed
neutral	shipping is not free as_advertised .
neutral	generally overall service was very good .
neutral	good website .
neutral	good range of spares to choose from .
neutral	however when brought online i checked the next_day to see my order had been received but the payment had not gone_through and the item not yet desptached .
neutral	i immediately ( without thinking ) went on line and gave my payment details again .
neutral	then i realised i had now ordered two !!
neutral	apparantly the payment is stated as gone_through only when the item has actually desptached .
neutral	i thought it was waiting for my payment before it would despatch !
neutral	!
neutral	i rang up the call_centre number and spoke to a guy_who said he would cancel one of the orders !
neutral	great i thought - jobs a good un until the next_day when two items turned_up !
neutral	also checked and found the amount had also been taken twice .
neutral	good job it was only a spare slider unit for the showere head at £_00 and not an actual showere unit itself !
neutral	have kept the second item as a spare !
neutral	i prepaid for parking ..
neutral	upon my return , i landed early .
neutral	got my luggage quickly too .
neutral	but by the time i got to my car , they said i exceeded my grace_period and charged me another $_00 or $_00 dollars and were rude with their explanation so i just let it go and left .
neutral	nothing wrong with the store '_s service , or the product .
neutral	but i received an_email_saying my item would be delivered on the friday , and that this was guaranteed .
neutral	i waited in all day , but it did not arrive .
neutral	it arrived on the following_monday_afternoon , with no apology or explanation for its lateness .
neutral	disappointed with winter plant selections .
neutral	narcissus variety especially sparse .
neutral	no calamansi trees .
neutral	i started with half the recommended dosage of alpha_brain and took it once in morning and night .
neutral	all it gave_me was terrible headaches that inhibited my focus and i couldn_'_t think about anything accept the headaches .
neutral	it could be the high dosage of choline and huperzine a .
neutral	not sure but i quit taking it bc of headaches .
neutral	shroom_tech on the other hand is amazing and i love it
neutral	in the automotive marketplace on time performance and turn - around time is important .
neutral	part of keeping a business moving everyday is cost control parts , payments , returns are an every day occurrance and vendors are measured on all accounts .
neutral	thanks for the great parts and service , now work on a realistic return_policy and timeline .
neutral	they had multiple listings for the item i wanted .
neutral	i emailed to find out why .
neutral	i was eager to get the glasses and the response seemed to take a bit so i tried there online_chat .
neutral	rep told me the 0 item numbers were different and told me which was the one i wanted .
neutral	an_hour later my first e_mail was responded to saying that the 0 item numbers were exactly the same and it didnt matter which one i ordered .
neutral	i let them know about the conflicting stories and was told its impossible for them to know what is what because they have so many products .
neutral	really ?
neutral	i have received my product and it is damaged .
neutral	i have not contacted them yet to resolve this .
neutral	i recieved an e_mail requesting my opinion on this site and another .
neutral	the other site does not offer the option to write a review ??
neutral	?
neutral	site is not very user_friendly very hard to find products and codes keep changing
neutral	while i have yet to install the new parts , they appear to be correct .
neutral	i am disappointed however to discover that there was no receipt sent with my order .
neutral	it is important to me to keep records of maintenance done on my vehicles .
neutral	now i am going to have to make a call and attempt to contact someone that can help me .
neutral	i paid nearly $ 0 to ship my items .
neutral	when it finally arrived days late , the box noted " 0 day priority_mail ."
neutral	your website indicated may 00 as expected arrival_date .
neutral	it arrived two_days after that , may 00 -- a full week of shipping time .
neutral	also , one item , an oil_dipstick , is useless to me ... it is too large for the tube enclosure on my volvo .
neutral	on balance , i was satisfied with the prices of the other items .
neutral	however , i will likely not use you again due to these problems ... i don_'_t feel that i got the shipping service that i paid for and one of 0 items is worthless to me .
neutral	i would return the useless dipstick with a request for a refund , but that is more time and expense to me .
neutral	perhaps you might consider a partial_refund of my expenses as a result of my negative experience .
neutral	i would consider that reasonable .
neutral	otherwise , as i stated , i will likely use one of your competitors ( i '_ve used partsgeek in the past ) for future_purchases .
neutral	unfortunately , my review is not very positive , but it is true and candid .
neutral	sincerely , bill spahr
neutral	i placed an ordered on 0 / 00 / 00 for one item and i am still_waiting ... it '_s now 0 / 00 / 00 still_waiting .
neutral	shipping from tx to wa should only take 0 days ??
neutral	?
neutral	it has taken way too_long to get the order from wisconsin to the west_coast .
neutral	everything was supposedly " in stock " yet it wasn_'_t sent out for a week & now , 0 - weeks since it was sent ( 0 - weeks from order date ), it still_hasn_'_t arrived .
neutral	will shop elsewhere in the future !
neutral	only had my glasses a couple of weeks and the nose rest fell of , there screwed on and the screw fell out , looked at all my other glasses and there all riveted , so super_glue to the rescue !
neutral	!
neutral	é a segunda bateria que mando vir e são de exelente qualidade .
neutral	já o tempo de envio é_muito demoroso , quase 0 meses .
neutral	fora isso foram respondendo ao meu contacto .
neutral	product does what it says on the tin !.
neutral	when ordering i was told the product was in stock .
neutral	it turns_out it was not .
neutral	i was given a delivery date which came and went .
neutral	no communication from go - electrical .
neutral	my phone_calls to them charged at more than local rates .
neutral	when product eventually arrived it was well_packaged and in good order
neutral	return date was wrong so national would have charged us for 0 extra days if i hadn_'_t noticed .
neutral	also we reserved a mid - sized car which was supposed to be vw_passat or similar .
neutral	they offered us an audi_a0 which is significantly smaller than a passat so we had to pay more to upgrade to a larger car .
neutral	due to the glitches noted above the whole rental check out process took 00_minutes to 0 hour .
neutral	just ordered a dorman window_regulator motor and took door apart ... again for simple install and found 0 of the 0 screw receptors will not accept the screws that seem to seat just fine in the old part .
neutral	kind of frustrating to say the least .
neutral	good selection of products but once i paid for my order there was no follow_up .
neutral	i didn_'_t know that my handle had shipped but not my suitcase .
neutral	i tried to track my suitcase online but ran_into a dead end on the website
neutral	i wish if you can make the pictures of the dresses with same color of the dress !
neutral	in the past i have received all the travel_insurance information including a wallet sized card with policy number and phone numbers on it .
neutral	this time i was lucky to get the policy number and i got two of those !!
neutral	i called customer service at both travelocity and the insurance company and got no help .
neutral	the competition sent the insurance information as soon as i booked my flight .
neutral	i guess i '_ll go with them from now on .
neutral	excellent service to the easy places . expensive to anywhere out of that zone .
neutral	have recently got into road_bikes so just starting to get kit together one of my orders is still outstanding , what would have been nice would be the offer of a like for like replacement or the next similar product , have no_idea when i '_ll see my delivery so maybe a follow_up e_mail , would be better .
neutral	overall pleased with what i have received .
neutral	logo to small and in an awkward place on the pen
neutral	the price was good and the service acceptable .
neutral	there was one bad part about the whole_process .
neutral	i placed my order around 00 : 00 on a monday_morning and paid almost $_00 for overnight shipping so i could get my car running again as quickly as possible .
neutral	sadly , they were closed for memorial_day and no shipments went out until the next_day .
neutral	i had folks lined_up to help me with my repair , but i didn_'_t have the part .
neutral	when i sent an_email_asking about it the reply was terse and offered no apologies .
neutral	at the very least , they need to let customers know when they are not working .
neutral	we didn_'_t like having to leave the terminal in phoenix and then re - enter a different terminal in order to catch our connecting_flight .
neutral	we had to wait nearly an_hour to get through tsa !
neutral	after the wrong dates kept going in , it seemed to make the arrival dates up . it all worked well .
neutral	i ordered with the request to deliver on a monday .
neutral	this was apparentlu not possible because all shops were closed !
neutral	this is something that is known on beforehand and should be mentioned before ordering .
neutral	flowers were delivered on the next_day after consultation & approval of myself .
neutral	still effect was gone
neutral	i am tired of this game everyone ( meaning companies and retailer ) who want to set a password account .
neutral	i never desire or want a password to do purchasing .
neutral	if you want me to reorder eliminate the passover fiasco
neutral	love the clothes however , i have had continual problems with the website .
neutral	i can never log in and when i '_m re - directed to the password reminder page it never works .
neutral	when i called baracuta direct to purchase a jacket and although the customer service team were very polite they didn_'_t return my call and then took my address down incorrectly !
neutral	great staff in your covent_garden shop will_definatley re - visit them again instead of using the website .
neutral	it took 00 days from the date i orderd my items to arrive .
neutral	i got what i order but seemed slow getting here .
neutral	the item is fine , but i paid a lot for saturday delivery , but the package didn_'_t turn up till tuesday .
neutral	this wasn_'_t directly the fault of showerdoc , but ultimately it was their responsibility to get the item there on time .
neutral	they have now refunded the delivery cost , so this has_gone some way towards sorting the issue but we were still without a shower for a number of days as a direct result .
neutral	our family spent two_nights at fairfield .
neutral	we found the rooms and beds small for our family , but the room / bathroom was very clean .
neutral	the front_desk was friendly and helpful .
neutral	during the day we stored our_luggage in our room .
neutral	someone opened my wife '_s suitcase and moved items .
neutral	a phone charger was taken from the wall .
neutral	housekeeping says that a new housekeeper cleaned our room and did not realize that we were staying ( seems like the luggage might have been a clue ), so s / he took our charger and shampoo to the gm '_s office .
neutral	no problem .
neutral	the motel promised to pay to have our items shipped to us .
neutral	i then received a call from ups stating that i would be billed for shipping since i had left the items at the motel .
neutral	i really believe the housekeeping issue was a legitimate mistake .
neutral	the shipping chargers were pretty tacky .
neutral	i would not stay there again , but not because of housekeeping .
neutral	the rooms were just too small .
neutral	for my money , i would go with comfort suites over fairfield every time .
neutral	twice_now i have received coffee from this vendor that was not the coffee advertised .
neutral	jamaican blue mountain coffee at $_00 / lb seemed like a good price but what arrived was not jbm .
neutral	no aromatics no sweetness just awful .
neutral	i have had navy coffee that was tastier than that mess .
neutral	likewise , an order of mocha java was extremely variable .
neutral	definitely mj for about 0 . 0 lbs then the coffee nature changed dramatically to less aromatic and more acidic .
neutral	having consumed mj as my daily coffee for over 00_yrs , i know what it tastes like and sometimes there is mocha java in my cup and some days not .
neutral	today is a " not " day .
neutral	i do not know whether it is this vendor committing the fraud or his supplier .
neutral	but be warned .
neutral	today is an " on " day .
neutral	however , it is because the pound of java estate is simply divine .
neutral	i mixed it with the old variable mocha java at precisely 0 mocha java to one java estate and it produces a marvelous ... cup of coffee , tongue coating , aromatic and complex with little " bite ".
neutral	thanks pete !
neutral	hello .
neutral	when the clock came my wife became very glad .
neutral	it took some time but what i can understand the problems were
neutral	from usa .
neutral	ordered and received in good condition a behr fsu part for my 0000 000i .
neutral	there was no notice in description that this part from a long time german company is now made in china .
neutral	who_knows_how long this part will last or if it will function at all ?
neutral	shipping and handling for delivery of this part to honolulu was $_00 . 00 .
neutral	usps shipping cost was $ 0 . 00 .
neutral	eeuroparts ordering system needs upgrades to generate more accurate s &_h cost .
neutral	eeuroparts would not provide a partial credit for excessive s &_h cost .
neutral	package came in good time but the boxes the parts were shipped in were destroyed .
neutral	not sure if the parts are ok yet .
neutral	my mechanic will let_me know next week .
neutral	prices appear to be good , but when you factor in the high shipping_costs they were honestly not as competitive .
neutral	i ordered two different_kinds of wines that apparently came from two different distributors , and each charged a shipping fee .
neutral	i understand how that business model works for them -- no carrying cost of inventory and they pass the shipping cost along to the consumer - but they need to understand that their competition is priced very competitively and typically includes free shipping with a certain minimum purchase .
neutral	as a result , since my purchase i '_ve spent nearly $ 0000 on wine , 000_% of it from other online sources , and i ' d estimate that better_than two - thirds of those purchases were also available from saratoga wines .
neutral	i do not expect to use saratoga wines again except as a reference point when evaluating the prices of other online wine offers .
neutral	the gaskets i ordered ( and were in stock according to website ) didn_'_t ship with my order and set me back a week .
neutral	they did credit the cost back to me but with no_explanation .
neutral	the muffler was poorly_packaged and has dents all over it , and surface rust on the flanges .
neutral	the threads for attaching the tail_pipe have surface rust so it '_s hard to thread a bolt into them .
neutral	the tail_pipe mounting_holes are shaped so that a gasket won_'_t seal properly .
neutral	my advice is to take the time to find direct fit products from a specialty distributor specific to your vehicle .
neutral	the only benefit here was price , but as they say , " you get what you pay for !"
neutral	even_though the driver new it was only my daughter at home he just made her move the cars , dumped the doors on the floor on a palet and left , a little help for my daughter to take each one off and put them in the garage would have been nice
neutral	i '_m happy you had what i needed and were a few cents cheaper_than the next online store , but i won_'_t be ordering from you again because of how long it took to ship and receive my items .
neutral	i know you don_'_t have control over usps , but you do have control over your order processing .
neutral	price kept changing .
neutral	too many sheets printed out when hit print confirmation ( only need reference , times / dates and directions
neutral	the tour_guides were excellent - knowledgeable and fun .
neutral	however our day was tainted by first of all a guest handler and a bus driver having a heated argument in front of me and my family when i asked a straightforward question , and then a very long gap_between buses leaving us getting wet in the rain , together with some of your staff stretching the truth a little as to the reason , and then getting timings very wrong ( due to one of the drivers stopping for an inordinate time to chat to his mates ) meaning that had i not made some calls to delay start of the ghosts of london tour we would have missed that as well .
neutral	the delivery was quick but a lack of tracking_info .
neutral	the mirror was not of the same quality as the original .
neutral	the mirror vibrates badly making it hard to see vehicles clearly behind me .
neutral	too much hoopla . just not my fave . way too hard to uninstall . i use unthreat . i think that is one of the best .
neutral	not as good as it used to be , has_been really overshadowed by fb
neutral	the service from the staff was very good but the 0 seater people carrier we were given was getting on a bit and the air_conditioning needed re - gassing , which made travelling in the heat of the day very uncomfortable .
neutral	the game of quoits which we ordered is still to be delivered .
neutral	my order was not shipped for 0 days after it was placed .
neutral	total time to receive parts was 0 days
neutral	was not given the car - type reserved .
neutral	could not fit 0 - suitcases in trunk as per website .
neutral	fuel_tank was less_than half and not noticed so i ate most of the cost ( 00 euro ).
neutral	lots of damage on the car not noted on contract .
neutral	long lines at both pick - up and drop_off at florence downtown office .
neutral	i would not rent from this location again .
neutral	average booking .
neutral	i am very much interested to see a flat_rate plan on any given country .
neutral	fast shipping .
neutral	the hertz location in monza was certainly not centrally_located in town or near public_transportation , but a 00 minute_walk from the train_station at a auto_repair yard .
neutral	before going to pick it up we called ahead to say we were on on way .
neutral	when we arrived there was no one there , it was before_noon time .
neutral	we finally called aon the phone , and the man said he would be there in i0 minutes .
neutral	he had none of my information on his computer , and seeing that he spoke no english we were in for quite a session .
neutral	i was then told that there were no compacts available and he gave_me a station_wagon , which of course was most inconvienent as parking in italy is a problem and the price of gas is very high .
neutral	the car was presented very unclean both in and out .
neutral	the gentlemen was gracious enough when i returned the car to give us a ride to the train_station .
neutral	gerald e . clare
neutral	other than that fine
neutral	because your website indicated you don_'_t ship to alaska , we had to have the part sent to an address in texas and then sent to us in a flat_rate box .
neutral	we don_'_t have the part yet .
neutral	it would be a big benefit to us if you could ship to alaska .
neutral	it is not any harder to ship here vs other_places in the usa .
neutral	the guy from kwik_fit spoilt the experience by only putting 00psi pressure in all the tyres .
neutral	he was close with the front , they should have been 00psi but the rears should have been 00psi !!
neutral	!
neutral	as century00 we used to work with another printing . com agent .
neutral	since the change the quality of leaflets purchased has deceased ( lower gsm ), not prices .
neutral	we ordering the same paper leaflets , but the paper is thinner and we have no other choice .
neutral	delivery prices are still expessive also .
neutral	although the delivery was prompt , the name was not put on the address_label and therefore as it was delivered to a work address , it had to be opened to find out who had ordered it .
neutral	in addition the number of tablets that arrived was incorrect ( short by 0 tablets ).
neutral	we had the same experience on the previous time we ordered tablets .
neutral	i had auto delivery & tried to change it but couldn_'_t figure_out how - there was no one available to live_chat with me so it said email & we will get back to u .
neutral	no one did & the auto delivery came before i could change it .
neutral	there goes the convience of auto ship .
neutral	the prices are good the shipping is fast - unless it '_s a small package & coming thru the regular mail , then it '_s really slow .
neutral	i was looking for the product i have bought and this is the only page i have found that had it .
neutral	apart_from the cost of the product , in spain was 00 € cheaper , i don_'_t have any comments .
neutral	the product was delivered timely in fact sooner_than i expeceted , but due to the packing job performed it was slightly_damaged .
neutral	it was still able to be used , but when i order something i expect the product to be treated better .
neutral	i have ordered lots of parts / if quality is an issue ergo last a long time / go elsewhere .
neutral	if not great place to buy
neutral	ordered 0 dresses from boohoo both did not look like the pictures i saw on - line ( material was a bit odd for my liking ) so decided to return both and obtain a refund .
neutral	the process was pretty simply i just had to let them know i was returning the items and send them back via the 0nd_class postage enclosed .
neutral	there are a few things i would change such as provide 0st_class postage i understand it costs more but providing a quicker exchange process would mean better service .
neutral	a lot of on - line retailers such as asos and new look are allowing customers to post return items via collect plus which is great as it allows you to return the item via newsagents , petrol stations near you and you can track the item to .
neutral	also a acknowledgement email_informing_me the item has_been received would be helpful and allows me to know everything is in hand and refund will be processed shortly .
neutral	and finally the £ 0 . 00 per item re - stocking_fee is a bit of a rip_off no other on - line retailer does this not sure why boohoo feel the need to charge this as well , they might want to look at asos as they offer free standard delivery , allow customers to return items via collect plus offer exchanges and best of all their email communication to keep you up to date is great .
neutral	i wont be purchasing from boohoo again too much hassle have to pay for delivery , slow returns process and the £ 0 . 00 re - stocking_fee is just a little too greedy for me .
neutral	very good products at the best prices
neutral	the service is great , customer service and the places available to order from are also excellent but the website leaves much to be desired and is not as good as competitors ' sites .
neutral	i bought some radio_knobs for my escalade .
neutral	even_though the box says they are for an escalade they are , in fact , not for an escalade .
neutral	the tune knob doesn_'_t even come_close to fitting .
neutral	the prices are definitely the best on the web with many closeout_deals on high end brands of supplements , however , the shipping_costs are outrageous and they have a big thing allover the site about a low or free shipping scam from other_companies , but i used to use ebay a lot and shipping a product that is compact and weighs 0lbs does not costs $_00 .
neutral	also they are big in " free " samples , for every little . 0 oz packet you add to your cart they add another $ 0 . 00 to your shipping .
neutral	even_though their shipping_costs make me sick to my stomach , some of their closeout sales always bring me back .
neutral	the car was in good conditon .
neutral	however there are couple of things that can be improved :
neutral	0 .
neutral	it took more than a hour to get the car : waiting in line , processing the various forms , and checking the car .
neutral	0 .
neutral	i expected to get a new car that is used only for short time .
neutral	i got quite an old car - at_least two years old .
neutral	booked online for collection next_day , courier never turned_up , contacted interparcel to see what happened , they spoke to the courier then told me the courier never received the booking , breakdown on the part of interparcel , asked me if i would like to re - book , the item was time sensitive which is why i went with a tracked service , told them it needed to be there day after tomorrow , had to then be put through to a manager and complain to her before they agreed to upgrade to overnight delivery for no extra_charge , this should have been offered from the off , i shouldn_'_t have had to argue the point . item got there on time but only after the hassle of having to wait in all day for 0 days waiting for collection , 0 day i expect , but using both of my days off sitting around is not what i expect , will go back to using [_external link ] in future
neutral	foirtunately one of the locals saw our plight , told us where the hertz facility was , and pointed_out the taxi stand .
neutral	if not for him we would still be waiting at the train_station .
neutral	i believe to enhance the buyers ( me ) satisfaction you guys should taylor boxes to specific types of fisherman .
neutral	for me i '_m a bass fisherman .
neutral	i feel_like we should have an option to choose certain types of lures we " d like to see in it every month
neutral	i was a little surprised when i did not receive the item i purchased after a week of waiting .
neutral	i called and talked to them about it and they said they don_'_t state whether the item is in stock or not ...
neutral	true , they don_'_t .
neutral	but they had a problem with their supplier having the item ordered in stock .
neutral	i finally received the item ( they did upgrade shipping to fedex next_day ).
neutral	still not best practices in online shopping .
neutral	i was dissapointed that cruise_finder did not spell out the time to pay the balance after the deposit was paid .
neutral	to say the balance is due is the very next_day is not acceptable ,
neutral	there was an element of " readers digest selling " that is not to my taste , i find that annoying , however the overall experiance was ok .
neutral	regards
neutral	howard moore
neutral	great coat when you get the right colour size and sex but why does the customer have to chase when superdry make a mistake why aren_'_t you trying to delight your customer with service when you get it wrong instead of making them wait another 00 days yes 00 days !!!!!!!
neutral	unless customer makes lots of calls .
neutral	shipping was slow , didn_'_t receive it for a week
neutral	i find it '_s difficult to navigate the iphone_app , just wish it had the same functionality as the website .
neutral	the range of items in stock seems to have diminished recently , however what they do have in stock is really good quality at amazing prices .
neutral	my issue with 0000rpm is their customer service .
neutral	everything has to be done on a ticket service and it '_s just too slow !
neutral	they claim to answer the tickets in 00_hours but it seems to be closer to 00_hours .
neutral	i had ordered inks , they sent me the wrong colours , 0000rpm apologised and said they would send out the correct ones free of charge .
neutral	they kept their word but this time sent out the right colours but the wrong_size !
neutral	000_% smaller !
neutral	after waiting another 00_hours , i called them to explain the problem .
neutral	once again , very apologetic and promised that the problem would be rectified so here we go , fingers_crossed for third time lucky !
neutral	mind you , i have to admit , i '_m currently on their website filling_out another order form , so even_though this time has not been an amazing experience , i am and always will be a loyal_customer !
neutral	this site is the perfect choice for cheap car parking .
neutral	perfect if like me you do a lot of cheap flights a year with all the budget airlines , this site has come out the cheapest every time .
neutral	simply good what you need more
neutral	re / voucher # 000 - 0000 , we were told that you would send a credit of $_00 . 00 .
neutral	we appreciate your adjustment to this rental .
neutral	coolshop appears to be as good a shop ( on - line ) as all the others .
neutral	competitive_pricing means you will sometimes be directed there [ from the comparison site is use ].
neutral	maybe it '_s just me , i '_m still_waiting on my current order .
neutral	one of my previous_orders went missing and they replaced it reasonably quickly .
neutral	i had then to give a full explanation [ twice ].
neutral	fair enough , you would say but six_months later they contacted me again to repeat the process of investigation .
neutral	[ incidentally , the game bought was not very good so much ado over nothing !].
neutral	so , i '_m sitting wondering_if this order will appear ; fingers_crossed it does !
neutral	!
neutral	two for price of one filter is a value play ... delivery time may be a problem ...!
neutral	i send in a natural bi color sapphire , natural ruby and a natural heat treated pink sapphire a few_months_ago for appraisals .
neutral	i ask to get the place of origins for each one and it was not included in my appraisal paperwork .
neutral	i also ask if they still offer free engraving on un mounted stones and they said yes but they never did it .
neutral	thats the only reason_why a give them 0 out of 0 starts .
neutral	they did update me on my stones frequently and they did give me the best appraisal than a local jewellery store with no lab would ever give me .
neutral	i bought two tires from town_fair_tire about 00 months_ago .
neutral	my expectation was that 00 to 00 thousand_miles from then i would go back to replace those tires .
neutral	the fact is that i '_ve been back three_times because the damn things won_'_t hold air !... once for one tire and twice for the second .
neutral	the second tire went completely flat on the road and aaa had to be called .
neutral	i have to say that all the front people at town_fair have been over the top nice and helpful , but there seems to be a problem somewhere .
neutral	it '_s okay .
neutral	site navigation could use some work .
neutral	from my standpoint , getting charged $ 0 . 00 twice for shipping was a real shame when the single $ 0 door_hinge rebuild kit could have been thrown in an envelope and definitely shipped cheaper .
neutral	my order being shipped from two locations looks_like a way to make up for good pricing to make money off of shipping .
neutral	i will use parts_geek in the future , but paying double shipping won_'_t happen again .
neutral	i '_ll order the part ( s ) which are at another warehouse from a diff .
neutral	company and give them the extra shipping dollars .
neutral	booking on - line a bit unclear re : location of job & home address .
neutral	arrived very close to 00 . 00 on the day and i was worried that job would not be finised in time .
neutral	it was .
neutral	would have been good if wheels were cleaned after the job .
neutral	alloyes were left pretty dirty woth what looked like oil
neutral	not competitive with parts bin or ebay .
neutral	horrible return_policy and if you change your mind on a part after you place an order but before it ships out doesnt_matter your still screwed .
neutral	takes to long to get a refund , restocking_fee , etc etc .....
neutral	even if you get the wrong part you are still responsible for the shipping .
neutral	the flowers got there ............. 0 hrs later ( paid for 0hr express delivery ) :((
neutral	the furniture is good however when we received the furniture the packaging takes the height and width to larger than you can get in your door , we received two large display cabinets which are very nice what spoiled it was that the delivery people could not get it in the house and yes i know it says they can not take the packaging off because of there schedules but a few_minutes of there time would have saved me waiting hours to get someone to help get the furniture in my house .
neutral	if i was buying anything large again would i go to oakland then probably no because i have larger items in the house such as a fridge and the delivery people took it out of the packaging which helped .
neutral	people traveling with their pets can '_t afford to be choosey about their accomodations .
neutral	this was acceptable considering the circumstances .
neutral	overall the site was easy to use but i objected to dealing in euros and having to pay conversion charges afterwards .
neutral	i ordered a headlight mount but the piece would , not accept the stock light n pins would not hold it in and mound was too flimzy
neutral	goldstar is the first place i visit to find shows in los_angeles and it '_s surrounding areas .
neutral	the web_site is nice and easy to maneuver .
neutral	the only problem i really have is how much they charge for their service .
neutral	how can they charge a 0 dollar service fee on a $_00 dollar ticket and a 0 dollar service fee on a comp ticket ?
neutral	it is absolutely insane and frustrating .
neutral	at_least ticketmaster '_s charges are universal .
neutral	goldstar '_s service charges are incomprehensible and reek of pure greed .
neutral	so , as a customer , we are still paying 0 bucks on a free ticket ?
neutral	that is no_longer free and i ' d rather just pay full price at the door at that point out of pure disgust with this site .
neutral	make it the same charge for every ticket .
neutral	like 00_% for example .
neutral	if you can '_t afford to put up comp tickets , then don_'_t post them .
neutral	charging us for free tickets is pretty cruel .
neutral	satisfied for all except the parts that did not fit my 0000 allstate .
neutral	i tried to ship back for credit but , package was returned about 0_weeks_later ; apparently was never received .
neutral	shipping_costs was almost equall to what credit would have been .
neutral	when ordering from u . s . it is important to get the right parts .
neutral	sip seems to have been willing to give credit but still not sure how that would have worked .
neutral	i am sastified with the storage_unit , have never had any_issues .
neutral	the only_thing was the price increase after i was there after 0 year , you would think my fee would stay the same when newer rentals prices were increased .
neutral	i guess its there way of saying now that we have you here its gonna cost you more .
neutral	it would be nice if you could talk to a real_person if needed .
neutral	the part i found on the site was not actually the part i needed .
neutral	the return process has_been easy so_far but i should not have to pay to return something that was incorrectly listed .
neutral	never could get the burner to work without leaving black carbon soot all over the logs .
neutral	talked to customer service and tech_support but no joy .
neutral	it '_s as if there should be a different orifice or a gas / air mixer where the natural_gas comes into the burner .
neutral	it was a great surprise to get all thing on time with great professionalism .
neutral	the worst part was to discover the " handling - and payment costs " wich were almost 0 / 0 of the price .
neutral	i appreciate the great prices but dont like to see the large cost in shipping .
neutral	i especially dont like it that the shipping goes up after i add some of the free products .
neutral	on some of my previous_orders i have received some of my powder items were open and all over everything and i needed to spend time cleaning them up .
neutral	powder products that come in bags should come in plastic_bags to prevent this .
neutral	the whole big_bus staff was very friendly and all our questions were answered very polite .
neutral	but there was no communication between the bus staff and the boat staff .
neutral	we were not informed , that the water is too low for the boat .
neutral	we were told which way to walk to find the boat , but nothing about the problems there .
neutral	we also were not informed when we arrived , that the boat will not be able to come .
neutral	we wated nearly 00_minutes and were only informed when we asked how long we will have to wait anymore .
neutral	beacause of this story we lost nearly one hour .
neutral	the next big_bus we cached stopped after some minutes and the driver told us he will have a breake .
neutral	so if we want , we can ask an other big_bus or walk !
neutral	so , we asked an other big_bus and were told , if we do not want to wait 00_minutes , we have to walk .
neutral	result : we spent one day in london and missed about 0 hours of this day because of big_bus communikation problems and were not amused !
neutral	a good experience overall , but lost 0 hours wandering_around the frankfurt - weisbaden area trying to find the right road ( s ) to saarbrucken .
neutral	also needed to know where to drop_off car at paris ' gare du nord .
neutral	could '_ve used more help with a good map / directions in each case .
neutral	one lesson_learned : drop_off car in suburbs in paris , near a metro line , to avoid inner - city congestion .
neutral	fast service but either they sent me the wrong part or the one i got was faulty because after installing part i had the same problem so i spent twice the price and bought the part from a factory authorized parts dealer and problem was solved .
neutral	this is an update .
neutral	i received the rest of my parts today - so i am happy .
neutral	now if partsgeek would just man some phones ...
neutral	anyway , i am upping the rating by one star .
neutral	if i had been able to talk to someone and get a prompt answer to my questions , they would have gotten all 0_stars .
neutral	my previous review on this order
neutral	i received some of the parts i ordered immediately .
neutral	my other parts are still in limbo .
neutral	i made a single order for several parts .
neutral	the email detailing the tracking of my order was confusing .
neutral	there were 0 tracking_numbers .
neutral	the 0 tracking_numbers were repeated for each set of parts i ordered .
neutral	when i checked the tracking the same day that i received the first parts , one tracking_number indicated they were delivered , the second number came up as n / a , the third indicated that the parts would be delivered in several more days .
neutral	due to the fact that the tracking_numbers were repeated for each set of parts , i could not determine what tracking_number applied to what delivery so i just have to assume that i will receive the parts as indicated by the third tracking_number and they are not lost .
neutral	i tried to contact partsgeek but you cannot call them about a problem you can only use the online trouble ticket program and then you have to wait for 00 to 00_hours to get an answer .
neutral	i did receive an answer but it was not all that helpful " thank_you for contacting and informing us of the issue .
neutral	we apologize that you haven_'_t received your entire order and we have sent an e_-_mail over to the manufacturer to request the location of the remainder .
neutral	we should get a response today , but it can take up to 00_hours to receive feedback from them .
neutral	if the distributor is unable to locate your packages , you will be issued a refund upon approval .
neutral	claims such as this can take up to 00 days to settle , but generally do not .
neutral	we apologize for the delay ."
neutral	hopefully , i will receive my parts tomorrow .
neutral	if not , i will buy them from a local store where i can actually talk to someone if there is a problem .
neutral	overall , i would say that i am not inclined to order from partsgeek again because you cannot contact them by phone and talk to a person directly when there is a problem and the format of the email with the tracking_information is not clear at all .
neutral	i was worried something went wrong .... it appears that everything is just alright now .
neutral	yours faithfully
neutral	lucas madrid
neutral	i placed the order on 0 / 0 / 00 and as of 0 / 00 / 00 the order has not been received .
neutral	i made and order through paypal and received it in a couple of days .
neutral	i gave the tail_light 0_stars for fit and finish and 0_star for aesthetics for an average of 0_stars .
neutral	the tail_light i replaced had a center section with 00 red led '_s behind a clear lens .
neutral	the replacement i bought from parts_geek has an incadescent clear bulb behind
neutral	a red lens .
neutral	not even close .
neutral	i do intend to buy another tail_light from parts_geek to replace my remaining original tail_light when i get my income tax refund so thet '_ll match .
neutral	the price for 0 parts_geek lights is a lot less_than 0 toyota light .
neutral	sweet .
neutral	at normal price + transport it is cheaper to buy in a shop .
neutral	i ordered 0 pieces and received 0 still_waiting for the 0th piece .
neutral	had .
neutral	very fast service but order not complete !
neutral	i have sent several emails .
neutral	still_waiting on reply .
neutral	please call a frustrated customer at 000 - 000 - 0000
neutral	you accept money from customers , but you do not provide a conduit to facilitate correcting errors with the credit_reporting agencies .
neutral	i see that as only half a job .
neutral	one more item ... you report the " credit_score " developed by each credit bureau .
neutral	each agency has a different set of standards so comparison is sketchy at best .
neutral	multiple standards make for unreliable / inconsistent results .
neutral	why not report the fico score , which i believe is more widely used by more creditors to actually make credit decisions .
neutral	bought a game card online for gift .
neutral	zynga card could not redeem even after watching video . i feel if you let consumers know that it is the same as a store card it might help .
neutral	and to those that have never used a card i believe if you disclose that you only use the last 00 digits on the code .
neutral	i emailed and all i got was take a screen_shot and send it or make_sure its used in the states .
neutral	your key has 00 digits and only the last ten are to be used .
neutral	maybe i missed something on your site that said that .
neutral	i finally looked at an old gift_card and saw 00 digits .
neutral	i informed the person i sent it to try the last 00 and it went right thru .
neutral	i will use you again cause its easy to send in like 00_minutes now that i know how to use it .
neutral	still an awesome way to send gift_card .
neutral	this is a very nice facility and a great price ..
neutral	the only issue is the lighting only stays on for 0 minutes .. very annoying .
neutral	the motion light sensors are supposed to be adjusted ... been waiting weeks ...
neutral	the mirror i purchased vibrates at highway speeds
neutral	flowers were lovely if not a little worse for wear after being in the van for eight hours .
neutral	nice and clear homepage where it ’_s possible to make customized watches , a funny idea i just have to try .
neutral	i was looking very much forward to receive my new “ own design ” watch and i received the watch and was eager to unpack the package .
neutral	firstly , no warranty or instruction was followed , the strap was wrong and i have choose a glass backside , but something had went totally wrong as i could see the battery was fastened with a white piece of plastic ?
neutral	?...
neutral	after communication , i returned the watch for repair and even as twice the forwarder noticed them , it was not picked_up and there were no one home at the delivery address .
neutral	finally , it was picked_up and 0½ week_later , the watch was returned repaired and ok ( but still no warranty was followed )
neutral	so now i only need to have the refund of returning the package with the defect watch , but no , this is too time - consuming , i think i will just buy somewhere_else next time
neutral	i ordered two new mirrors for my truck .
neutral	one of the mirrors was broken when i opened the box .
neutral	the box looked like it had been used before .
neutral	it has staples brand tape on it where it has_been resealed .
neutral	it also had another shipping_label on it where it had be shipped to another customer and apparently was returned for some reason .
neutral	i have been offered a refund but then i have to reorder the mirror again and pay for shipping again .
neutral	why can you not just send me a new mirror and i will return the broken one ?
neutral	and not being_able to talk to a person by phone it a pain .
neutral	did not meet expectations of working with obi .
neutral	they had an excuse for each time why it wouldn_'_t work .
neutral	i have used the obi for 0 years with google_voice with no_issues and they blamed the ip the router , anything .
neutral	i asked for my money back and ran back to google_voice .
neutral	you parts were correct but you shipping cost are way too high .
neutral	i guess they do ok but cannot really explain or help with credit_reporting agencies .
neutral	if something went bad i am not so sure they would have my back !
neutral	the site is easy to use , has a great selection of products all in one place .
neutral	shipping needs to go out faster .
neutral	it took 0 business days for my order to be shipped due to no supply , they did upgrade me to 0 day shipping to try and compensate but was very aggravating not knowing if it would take another 0 days or 00 days to get my order through .
neutral	if it happens the next time i order i '_ll be looking elsewhere for supplements .
neutral	my order arrived on time , however , a pair of boardshorts i ordered was missing and in its place was a woman '_s tank top .
neutral	i called and was informed the shorts had been discontinued and they would send the replacement pair when they arrived .
neutral	overall , the service was good but would give 0 . 0_stars because if the item i ordered was discontinued , this situation could have been avoided if the website were updated to let the customer know .
neutral	i bought the stater pack as most people do , along with a choice of 0 flavours .
neutral	i chose menthol .
neutral	i found that this was far too powerful and made me cough quite a lot .
neutral	maybe it '_s just me , or should i have gone for the tobacco flavour ?
neutral	decent software does what you need it to without a bunch of hassle .
neutral	would def recommend
neutral	the system kept telling_me i didn_'_t have the country , city , state entered in for the billing or shipping address when i did .
neutral	then reset all fields for all .
neutral	this happened thrice .
neutral	happy with the outbound service .
neutral	inbound less good , called from luggage hall as instructed , but had to wait 00_mins for car at_heathrow - driver ( very polite , not his fault ) said , he ' d seen us arrrive as he was dropping_off previous car , then he had to return to base to get ours - seems they were very short of drivers !
neutral	is this how they keep cost down ?
neutral	cost - v good , v competitive but ' meet and greet ' should be the priority - we wanted a quick getaway after a day '_s travelling , and didn_'_t get it !
neutral	everything about the product and the purchasing experience is top quality , the graphic itself was easy to apply and is of a very good quality and should prove to be durable .
neutral	the email_updates regarding the progress of my order were great and the skin arrived swiftly .
neutral	my only_gripe would be the cost - at nearly_£_00 i do feel it is a little_pricey , a tenner would be more acceptable .
neutral	having said that , you could argue that you have to pay that little_bit more for wanting your gadget to look a little more unique .
neutral	the website is nice but the continue shopping process was tedious .
neutral	check out was slow because it kept flipping back and forth .
neutral	i had difficulty resuming my order .
neutral	good products and prices , generally good service .
neutral	i was a little_bit " put off " because i didn_'_t receive any call regarding my collection in store also they refused me to pass me my item because i didn_'_t have the purchase card on me ...
neutral	i have other two id '_s and cards with me ... ( procedures ).
neutral	eventually i '_ve been 0 times until i got my stuff ...
neutral	i would normally have given a higher rating but i was recently called to try to get me to use " autoship ".
neutral	if i wanted this feature i would check one of the many boxes that pop_up when i am ordering online .
neutral	bad move on your part .
neutral	i have been trying to return a part for about two_weeks and have not talked to anyone regarding this , it would be convenient if it were possible to contact a customer service number instead of waiting for them to call
neutral	i waited a week and had to call to see where my product was .
neutral	they said they would email me a tracking_number later that day .
neutral	took two_days to get the number .
neutral	and the tracking wasnt created until that day so it seemed like my ordrt had slipped under the carpet
neutral	i ordered a grille and it came in a decent_amount of time due to the hurricane . when i received the grille the box it came in was large enough to ship 00 grilles in and there was very little packing_material in the box causing the grille i bought to be damaged .
neutral	not damaged to the point of not usable but damaged none the less .
neutral	but overall prices are great shipping is quick but packaging skills leave little to be desired .
neutral	may not work for everyone . google worked better .
neutral	i ordered two taillight assemblies .
neutral	although the light were the right size , the clips to plug in the lights were not .
neutral	i reused the old clips from the lights i replaced but was disappointed to not be able to use all the parts shipped .
neutral	the only flaw in this system is the roi .
neutral	i have not received one phone_call or email from the advertisement package with datasphere .
neutral	i am locked into a one year contract for a service that is delivering zero results .
neutral	the data shows that people are viewing or looking at my ad and or coupons , but no one is using them .
neutral	i have tried several different coupons and still no results .
neutral	the experience with the team from the sales call to set_up was excellent , but knowing what i know now , i would not have used this service .
neutral	the shipping and pricing were great .
neutral	in fact , i could not believe_how quickly i received the product .
neutral	unfortunately , the filter did not fit my 0000_honda_pilot .
neutral	not sure if it was due to the fact that the pilot has a tray that the filter sets in , or just that the part doesn_'_t fit the 0000 model as_advertised .
neutral	i would probably buy again , but maybe call first to speak to someone .
neutral	the ordering_process was easy , but the shipping took way to long .
neutral	to many hands touching the package , before it get '_s to my house .
neutral	one part shipped fedx the other shipped ups , but neither company delivered the parts , then were both droped off at my local post_office for them to deliver .
neutral	took 0 - 00 to get to me .
neutral	not sure if i will order from you again .
neutral	it was very easy to sign_up initially just hate to see the fine_print after purchasing stating that there will e an_additional_cost .
neutral	at 00 $ per day plus 00_% tax it '_s quite a bit extra i '_ll need once i get to las_vegas when checking in .
neutral	i ordered a pair of glasses that took a couple weeks to arrive .
neutral	they had a flawed lens .
neutral	customer service was fine about returning them and provided a postage paid overnight return_label .
neutral	now , it took another couple weeks for the glasses to be sent back with a new lens ... no expedited processing or shipping .
neutral	no communication or replies to my emails inquiring the status of the glasses during this wait .
neutral	my wife ordered a pair of glasses recently and was not notified the frames were on back order until after the order was fully placed .
neutral	fortunately , they were back in stock in a reasonable period of time .
neutral	small pocket_knife purchased for someone_else for christmas was " engraved " with their initials .
neutral	while it looked nice right out of the box , it did not look like the letters were engraved very deeply , if at all .
neutral	more like the letters were just " printed on " the knife .
neutral	we '_ll see -- if the lettering is just_plain gone in a very short time of being in their pocket .
neutral	hoping i '_m wrong .
neutral	i used to love target and did all of my major shopping there for paper towels and the like .
neutral	would load up once a month with non_- perishables .
neutral	then i read that the money i spent there was being funneled to support far right causes and i stopped shopping there .
neutral	now , they get to know why .
neutral	really , that is the only issue i have with them and would still be spending my money there if not for that .
neutral	now i mostly use amazon .
neutral	well i was told about your web sit from a friend and i was in need of a starter so i checked partsgeek out and rely liked the prices for sure so i ordered from the sit with no problem .
neutral	when i had a question about free shipping that my starter had said was free shipping because i got an_email_saying that my item qualified for free shipping but you have to fill_out this form to go to some second party i was confused so i opened a support_ticket to ask what to do because i thought it came with free shipping , very simple question right .
neutral	well the support people could not answer my question and gave_me this stupid reply that had nothing to do with the free shipping question , so i tried again , and again , three_times and no one there could just give me an answer to my very , very , simple question so i gave up .
neutral	i don_'_t think the people there no how to read english and or just don_'_t give a crap and they could not even give me an answer to my question it all .
neutral	how stupid do you have to be to work there ? if you cant read english and give a reply back that has to do with your question then i ask you what good are you and your support_ticket crap ?
neutral	, even_though the support_ticket is a bunch of shit since no one there can answer simple questions i can over look stupidity since the prices are so good threw partsgeek i will order from them again but someone there needs to get on the ball and give english classes to the support_team , makes you wonder_if they even have green cards or wonder just how much pot there smoking before , during and after work , my question could of been answered by a 00 year_old it was so simple of a question but your team just couldn_'_t do it , o - well i will still buy from them even_though because of the grate prices they have on parts .
neutral	waiting a week and saving a $_000 , it '_s still worth the aggravation you will have with there support_team so if you do order from partsgeek don_'_t expect any kind of legitiment answers from them , you wont get the answer to your simple questions that '_s for sure !!.
neutral	don_'_t let that stop you from checking out there wide_selection of parts , you wont be disappointed by them .
neutral	great parts !!
neutral	sucky support_team !!
neutral	hopefully someone there who_cares_about there customer '_s will read this and do something about fixing there support_team because they need help !
neutral	!
neutral	first it would help if i could understand who i was talking to .
neutral	the girl made two errors in the planning of my trip so today i '_m trying to correct them .
neutral	one was a dinner we picked she made an error of 0 people instead of 0 and then canceled it but never re - booked it the right way .
neutral	then we had delta airlines but then when she went to the final process delta was sold out so she gave_us spirit air who i hate .
neutral	my mom and brother are flying together she is 00 and they need an isle seat and middle seat but i can '_t get the seats till check - in and they said they might not be together but they need to be so not really happy with anything so_far .
neutral	i wanted to pay for their bags before to get the cheaper price but cant do that either .
neutral	i '_ve used you before for my husband and i but not sure if ill use you again .
neutral	i was very pleased in your quality of service as far as materials and delivery of same . but your website and camunication has much to be desired .
neutral	i '_ve waited now for 0_weeks for a product question and still no answer .
neutral	hopefully you can help me .
neutral	after receiving my part in a reasonable time and at a reasonable cost , upon_opening i was immediately struck by the differences in the look of the replacement part and what it did not contain .
neutral	granted , although it does appear to be an exact_fit ( same number of bolt_holes , size and mounting shape , etc_., it was not an exact_match for my oe part .
neutral	even if it did fit , it would not be possible to do a complete repair , because it did not contain the oil_pan seal for the timing gear cover itself , or the 00 degree short seals for the exposed portions of the oil_pan .
neutral	this alone made it impossible to complete my repair without going shopping again to try to find the additional parts needed to do the job right .
neutral	when you tell me you have " everything needed " to do a complete repair , that is what i expect .
neutral	i will spend the rest of my time trying to figure_out how to mount the timing gear pointer after i return from another parts run .
neutral	caution is what i would tell others who purchase .
neutral	sometimes cheaper is not the best path .
neutral	the tail_light_assembly arrived time , and came with mounting_brackets , but it was missing the mounting_screws .
neutral	the old screws were to corroded to use and i had to scramble around trying find some .
neutral	i '_ve been wearing my sunglasses for a month now hoping i would adjust to the prescription in the lenses .
neutral	i thought it was because the tint on the lenses were darker than i expected .
neutral	but i just discovered that when i close my right eye , the vision in my left lens is very blurry .
neutral	i '_m suspect that their lab didn_'_t quite get my prescription right .
neutral	we had a peugeot_000 estate car with a diesel .
neutral	it was very comfortable and got 00 mpg ( us gallon - 00mpg imp gallon ) and hid our_luggage .
neutral	but it had terrible turbo lag .
neutral	when you pressed on the accelerator , your body lurched forward as the car seemed to almost stall , then finally get moving ( although none too swiftly ).
neutral	but , fine for the price and the mpg .
neutral	not much selection at_heathrow .
neutral	manchester looked much_better .
neutral	i did 0_stars due to the 00 minute wait at_heathrow .
neutral	otherwise , fine .
neutral	return at manchester was easy .
neutral	also , the roads are england are great .
neutral	you '_ll know why they built sport cars .
neutral	next time we '_ll see if we can get a mini or equivalent , because driving in england is really fun .
neutral	the missed delivery date was not good , 0 bunches later but still .....
neutral	0 different times the printer will not print and computer says the cartridges are not compatible .
neutral	i remove them and reinstall them and the printer will then print .
neutral	one big pain .
neutral	nothing more to add
neutral	my kitchen was delivered on 00th_november_0000 .
neutral	the design was based on my own measurements and i had it fitted by my own fitter .
neutral	when delivered i was advised that there were four items missing and they were subsequently delivered .
neutral	however , three of the items were doors that were not for my kitchen and would not fit any of my units .
neutral	( i had no doors missing ).
neutral	when my fitter installed the kitchen we found that the final 000mm wall unit would not fit as the wall was out of square .
neutral	no problem i thought i would just ask wren to do a swap , return the 000 unit and send me a replacement 000 unit .
neutral	i made this request on the 00th_december .
neutral	the initial response from wren was no they couldn_'_t do exchanges but would sell me a new 000 unit .
neutral	after expressing my disbelieve , in strong terms to the account_manager , that they would not exchange the unit having just spent £ 0000 with wren ( i even said i would stand the difference in cost ) , i was eventually told on the 00th_january that the unit would be exchanged .
neutral	however before wren would order the exchange unit the original 000 unit had to be returned to the darlington store .
neutral	i was next advised that an " uplift " of the 000unit would be made on the 00st january .
neutral	in the meantime i had tried to get an answer from the account_manager as to what they wanted done with the three doors that were not for my kitchen .
neutral	i never received a reply .
neutral	i also found that the designer had included a whole 0 . 0m length of plinth that was not needed for my kitchen design .
neutral	when the collection of the 000 unit was made i also sent back the three doors as i had had no response about these and also returned the excess length of plinth .
neutral	i advised my account_manager that these items had been returned and asked for a refund of £_00 . 00 for the plinth .
neutral	i received a reply from the second designer who had finalised my design ( the original designer being transferred ) to say that i should have checked the length of the plinth required 00 days before delivery , and that this was my fitters problem .
neutral	on the 00th_january i had a phone_call to say that the 000 unit was available for collection from the darlington showroom .
neutral	i collected it only to find that the door was hung the wrong way despite stressing i required a left_hand hung door .
neutral	in view of the previous problems i took the unit and my fitter reversed the door fittings .
neutral	i have heard_nothing regarding a refund for the excess plinth that was added to my order and now returned , nor has there been any suggestion , that i would receive the difference in cost of a 000 unit over the 000 unit returned .
neutral	i have to say that at the outset and during the design and sales process i was very happy with the service of wren and the staff were very knowledgeable and helpful .
neutral	however , once the kitchen was delivered and problems arose , the after sales customer service care was terrible .
neutral	i really could not believe the negative responses , and being told it was " company policy " not to exchange or refund .
neutral	if i bought these items at b_& q or homebase i would have had no problem returning them .
neutral	due to the poor after sales service i would not recommend wren to anyone considering a new kitchen , neither will my builder and kitchen fitter .
neutral	upon posting my review i very promptly received a phone_call from mr tofiq , regional manager who was sorry to hear about my after sales experience .
neutral	he agreed to refund me for the extra plinth and also the difference in cost between the 000 wall unit and the 000 unit .
neutral	he took immediate steps to implement this agreement and linked me into his phone_call to the manager at darlington instructing him to issue a cheque to me straight_away .
neutral	he was apologetic to me regarding the after sales experience that i had received , expressed his concerns to the darlington manager , and went a long way to retaining my goodwill with wren .
neutral	pity it took this to resolve .
neutral	there is a good saying regarding quality service .
neutral	get it right first time every time .
neutral	have increased my rating as a result of above .
neutral	arthur tyrrell
neutral	what i need is help getting the door panels off so i can reattach the window to the regulator which is working fine .
neutral	i purchased your chilton repair_manual to show me how to do that .
neutral	the description , i thought , indicated it covered just a couple years including 0000 the year of my saturn sc0 coup .
neutral	when the book arrived i discovered the manual covers 0 models of model years from 0000 thru 0000 .
neutral	there is so little detail and the pictures so poor it is going to be of minimal use , i '_m very disappointed to say the least .
neutral	i had three things i needed to address and none of the pictures were for my model .
neutral	i bought this book rather_than the other one you offer but it clearly covered a greater time period than i thought the chilton .
neutral	i guess i must have misread the description of the book , i '_m very disappointed .
neutral	your site looks very complete and should i need any parts i '_ll likely give you a try again .
neutral	i did order from partsgeek . com about about 0_weeks_ago and the package still has not arrived .
neutral	fedex is having alot of trouble delivering the package to me .
neutral	i mostly likely will not order again due to fedex shipping .
neutral	i ordered an oxygen_sensor for my 0000_lexus es 000 for the bank 0 sensor 0 location .
neutral	i confirmed the part match based on the picture provided on the partsgeek website .
neutral	the part that was sent was for sensor 0 position near the catalytic converted and included a rubber boot to seal the hole in the car floor where the sensor penetrates into the cabin .
neutral	the oxygen_sensor works but it is not the part i ordered .
neutral	the product is awesome and i recieved it just a couple days after i ordered it .
neutral	but it was advertised with free shipping but i couldn_'_t complete my order without agreeing to pay for the shipping .
neutral	i called customer service the next_day and they said they didn_'_t know anything about free shipping and it was too_late because it was already processed .
neutral	when i went back on my fb the next_day it was advertised again with free shipping .
neutral	so just saying , you might want to check into that .
neutral	headlamps looked great but the as i took the right headlamp_assembly out i heard a rattle noise .
neutral	the headlight was not clipped in place and the bulb fell out .
neutral	i needed to open the assembly and attach the clip to hold the bulb .
neutral	doesn_'_t seem to be inspected prior to shipment .
neutral	i have used egs on several occations and they are great and quick if the order is straight_forward .
neutral	but sometimes , if they are out og stock , i miss the informatiion to me as a buyer .
neutral	it has taken several days before they send an_email that they are out of stock .
neutral	i hope that this can improve in the future .
neutral	as usual the order process was fine , but when we got our delivery we only got 0000_litres despite ordering 0000 ... tank only 0 / 0 full and no_explanation as to why we did not get the whole order . the " chit " was stuffed into the house name plate at the bottom of our drive ... very unsatisfactory !
neutral	maybe because the delivery was from butler_fuels .. who we have also ordered from in the past !
neutral	i wish you would add to your products a born on date . i bought a promac with to much thermal grease , dripped down wipeing out the power_supply . straning everything .
neutral	your repair was i believe was $ 0000 . came back with multiple problems , including a noisy hardrive . which was 0 years old . myia did what she could . warranty out , i bought
neutral	another promac , seems to be ok .
neutral	i now have close to $ 0000 , in a 0 year_old computer .
neutral	some fault is apple computers are to damn expensive . this computer was about $ 0000 new . powermax did the best they could due .
neutral	the cost of my glass frames were reasonable , and shipping was quick , however a month later i received a bill for fedex for $_00 . 00 .
neutral	$ 0 . 00 for customs_duty , $ 0 . 00 for advancement fees , and $_00 . 00 for u . s . food & drug admin processing fee .....
neutral	the strange thing is that when my wife purchased her glasses last_year from same company , no_hidden_fees were accessed to her .
neutral	also , if these fees are legit ( which i seriously doubt ) they should be attached to the cost of the glasses .
neutral	slow mail delivery .
neutral	under insured .
neutral	meh .
neutral	walmart is closer , faster delivery .
neutral	bike delivered later than promised and - not unlike our politicians - merlin customer service seemed to do their best to avoid answering any questions i had directly .
neutral	after waiting four weeks for delivery the bike arrived with a slightly chipped frame .
neutral	i ' d say that the price reflects the service in this case .
neutral	all clothing and accessories were delivered promptly and in perfect_condition .
neutral	all the items ordered arrived on the date that the courier company agreed with me .
neutral	however , when the delivery driver brought the items up my drive on a pallet that was itself on a low trolley , he stopped outside my front_door then stood there with his hands in his pockets looking down at the items and said " you '_ve got 00_minutes to check them ".
neutral	he made no attempt to bring them into the house or to help remove the strapping and plastic sheet around them all .
neutral	i did it all myself then had to lift all the items into the house in order to check them .
neutral	some items were quite heavy ( vanity_unit and sink ).
neutral	i felt under quite a bit of pressure to check for damage as the documentation clearly_stated that this had to be done at the time of delivery and anything damaged had to be rejected there and then .
neutral	it would have meant unpacking everything there and then to do so with the delivery driver still standing outside the front_door with his hands in his pockets .
neutral	i could see that none of the boxes were damaged so i took the risk to accept it all without unboxing everything .
neutral	fortunately everything turned_out ok after unboxing later .
neutral	the square pop_up basin waste that i ordered that had been recommended to fit the sink i bought didn_'_t work properly as it " hit " the sink when pressing it down to engage it in its closed position .
neutral	i reported this via customer_services and they promised to send a replacement top for the waste that was a slightly_different shape .
neutral	this turned_up 0 days_later ( good ) but it is larger than the original top and looks too big for the sink that i bought ( bad ).
neutral	they said if i wanted to return it for a smaller round waste i would have to pay the postage to send it back .
neutral	all in all , most items ordered i '_m happy with apart_from the waste ( bought another one from [_link ] instead ) but delivery process too stressful so i wont use them again .
neutral	i was very happy with my shopping_experience and the end product , which was dispatched very quickly - however that is where is started to go_wrong !
neutral	citylink were due to deliver on thursday - nothing happened - looked on their site which said we were out and they left a card - we weren_'_t and they didn_'_t !
neutral	rescheduled delivery for monday - again nothing happened - it eventually turned_up at 00 . 00 on tuesday !
neutral	get yourselves another courier citylink are crap and damaging you !
neutral	i ordered amps mailers - clearly illustrated on their website page - what i received
neutral	was neo mailers - when i queried this i was told that neo had taken over amps .
neutral	had i known this i would not have ordered neo mailers without trying other_sites
neutral	to check if amps mailers were available .
neutral	the quick response i received indicated
neutral	that neo had taken over amps and that there should be no difference in quality , but
neutral	there is - as the amps mailers are much more robust and a brighter white in colour .
neutral	the points raised in my initial query were not addressed fully in their response .
neutral	i was ok i thought they could be more helpful .
neutral	most used phone company .
neutral	calls to cuba are very expensive .
neutral	please lower your rates to cuba and offer monthly rates .
neutral	customer service is simply unacceptable .
neutral	i was overcharged for several calls , asked to adjust , received no reply .
neutral	it was very easy to book the vacation .
neutral	i booked it and it went on my credit_card right .
neutral	i instantly paid the bill .
neutral	0 days_later another charge for the same booking has appear on my credit_card and they tell me they will take it off .
neutral	i will wait to see you .
neutral	the shipping turnaround was great , but they shipped the wrong product and looks_like i may be waiting a while before receiving the correct product .
neutral	my trip is not until jun of this year .
neutral	nothing i remember seeing told me i would be billed in advance for the full_amount and was shocked when it appeared on my credit_card statement that i paid 0 months before the trip .
neutral	not pleased at all and will never make reservations on line again for this company , i will call the hotel_directly .
neutral	by mistake called reservations . com when trying to reach oxford suites in pendleton oregon .
neutral	was told the rate shown on the internet was not available and was finally " sold " a room rate of $_000 . 00 / night for holiday_inn express .
neutral	however , when sent a confirmation e_-_mail , the rate was $_000 . 00 / night plus_tax .
neutral	after calling back and getting linked to management on the second try , i was told that they would credit my visa_card the difference and that i would receive a new confirmation e_-_mail .
neutral	not sure that i have been credited the price difference and i have not yet received a confirmation e_-_mail .
neutral	i made the reservation with nancy on 00 may and hooked up with management the next_day .

neutral	it works well but need a more updates .
neutral	having placed my order i agreed to collect as i needed labels urgently . i went online to get directions , when i got to citywest campus i followed the map and ended_up back on the n0 . after ignoring instructions and 00_mins .
neutral	later i found spicers . great , only to find my order was out on delivery , which i did not pay for . luckily when they contacted the driver he was actually at my home . i gave him instructions as to where he should leave the order .
neutral	i hope this was a once off experience
neutral	the part i wanted was listed as the left_side window .
neutral	luckily , i guessed right for the part i wanted .
neutral	it turned_out that the left_side was also the drivers_side .
neutral	however some mechanics view the car left and right from looking from the front of the car .
neutral	others veiw left and fight from the drivers seat .
neutral	i could not talk to someone to verify that i was getting the drivers_side window . please change you method of describing parts as drivers_side and passenger_side .
neutral	my name is joe yardas in case you want to give me a bonus .

neutral	i was very disappointed with the bag i have purchased for my wife '_s mobility scooter from rdk .
neutral	the bag is not of particularly good quality and the stick holders are completely_useless .
neutral	i have noticed that all companies selling bags designed for mobility scooters charge far more than equivalent sports bags etc .
neutral	i suppose the elderly and infirmed are an easy touch because certian mobility aids have to be purchased no matter what the cost and these firms know it .
neutral	using paypal can be really convenient , especially for exchanging money between friends / family .
neutral	i use it to collect the money for my fantasy_football league every year .
neutral	unfortunately , my account was recently hacked and someone ran up a couple_hundred_dollars in charges on my account .
neutral	while paypal eventually rectified the situation and i got my money back , it concerns me that it was so easy for someone to do that .
neutral	i was also locked out of my own account for a couple weeks after that happened , which was a headache .
neutral	we enjoyed the transfer to the changing of the guard , but it was one of the the most looked froward events , but it was canceled because go rain .
neutral	your man told us that if we booked thru their company instead of thru silver_shuttle that we could have saved 00_% on the price of the transfer .
neutral	next time i will do more research and recommend to other that they book direct instead of thru a booking company .
neutral	this same thing happen on the transfer to the airport .
neutral	bookbyte offered me great prices that couldn_'_t be beat .
neutral	the problem was that i didn_'_t receive what i thought i had ordered .
neutral	instead of getting a textbook , i got a bunch of unbound papers that made up the textbook .
neutral	it was the same material that i was looking for , but i would have liked to know that i wasn_'_t getting a bound book .
neutral	you will get a good price , but be weary as to what you actually receive .
neutral	also shipping took exceptionally long , over two_weeks .
neutral	delivery was super quick and efficient , however the item had been crammed into a box which was too small resulting in the product packaging being badly_damaged .
neutral	good looking goods @ reasonable pricing , knowledgeable helpful staff and catalog ..
neutral	i received a very fast completion from them .
neutral	i thought that maybe it had been transcribed by a robot ... there was some inaccuracy in places .
neutral	they are very competitive and ship very quickly
neutral	when i went shopping for a replacement for my old cracked cast_iron manifold , i wanted the replacement to be tube style not cast_iron .
neutral	i was sure i loooked at both the photos and the description which lead me to believe the part i ordered was what i wanted .
neutral	was quite disappointed to find like always these days , the ad doesn_'_t match what gets sent to you in the end .
neutral	it did fit well and so_far no_issues with the install .
neutral	everything was very good except that the shower_enclosure fitter messed_up the plastic door trims and the shower leaked like a seive and he threw away the instructions .
neutral	i asked bathempire if i could purchase more of the specically designed plastic trims but they could not help me nor could they send me replacement instructions .
neutral	the prices are great and the quality is there , but the web_site needs much improvement .
neutral	i would like to be able to save vehicles i am shopping for .
neutral	also would like to be able to save shopping lists and carts untill ready for purchase .
neutral	as is if you have to leave the site , your cart gets emptied and vehicle search is gone , even if i leave the site open .
neutral	then you have to start from scratch .
neutral	very inconvienent .
neutral	the part i ordered did not fit_perfectly .
neutral	not sure it is the best brand .
neutral	you way of ordering is quite simple , but trying to chech on an ordered part is terrible .
neutral	i have been waiting for an ordered manifold for my truck 0 days , so_far no part .
neutral	i have tried_calling on the phone , i have waited up to 00_minutes and never got to speak to a person ., the phone keeps getting distorted , and then tells_me due to overwhelming number of phone_calls they will not be able to take my call .
neutral	i have called 0 times and got the same response , and by the way try to track a shipment the way you explain , good luck .
neutral	if in the future i will ever order with is nill .
neutral	oh by the way as i was writing this little note to you i was just on the phone trying to speak to someone i just got disconnectd as usual .
neutral	ross anatra
neutral	that '_s really my only_complaint , they should be more up front about that .
neutral	shipped decently quick , good parts ...
neutral	i ordered a 0 items one of which was a water outlet for a discovery , i get a blower_motor for a mercedes .
neutral	do they send me the water outlet .. no i have to re - order it and wait 0_weeks for the credit for the first one and i have been waiting now for a week to get a call_tag to get they mixup back to them as they wanted me to pay for the return .
neutral	why on earth should i pay to return their part ?
neutral	when they are good - they are great , just pray there is no_problems with the order .
neutral	i could have beat your price on some items but i would have had to order from more than one place .
neutral	i wanted all the parts on one order and to arrive together .
neutral	your shipping could be a little better in that i ordered early on tuesday and received my parts the following_tuesday .
neutral	if your people had shipped the same day i ordered , my parts would have arrived on friday , giving me the long weekend to do the job .
neutral	example : i ordered a grooved belt with free shipping from a company in new_jersey on monday , the day before i entered your order .
neutral	the belt was shipped the same day and arrived on wednesday .
neutral	getting the order out in a timely_manner makes a big_difference .
neutral	you do have a large stock and fair prices , so i will probably order again .
neutral	disappointed with customer service .
neutral	it feels_like the fly attendants are there or the schedule .
neutral	they seem to be in a hurry to give you your hot drink and then have their break .
neutral	the regulator appears to be an after market part needed to add nuts instead of bolts .
neutral	after some adjustment i got it to work .

neutral	i am usually not one to write_reviews on things , but i thought i would add some insight to any of the guys out there searching for an_engagement_ring .
neutral	it has now been about 0 months since i proposed to my fiance and i can tell you that she absolutely_loves the ring that i got her .
neutral	to me my choice was pretty clear when i saw the difference_between what you could buy in the store 0 . 0kt ~ 0k dollars vs what you can get online 0 . 0kt ~ 0k dollars ( same specs ).
neutral	when you shop at an online_retailer like brilliance . com , enchanteddiamonds . com , even blue_nile they make about 00_%- 00_% margin vs . brick and mortar_store where you are going to pay about 00_% or more in margin in addition to what your diamond is really worth .
neutral	the reason that i rate brilliance . com as 0_star is because i am not sure that i was that impressed with their original recommendations they made on diamonds , and it took them forever to put_together the setting that i designed .
neutral	i paid a fair price for the setting that i got , but to be honest for the same price or a few_hundred_dollars more i could have bought the stone from brilliance and gone to 0 - 00 local jewelry_stores and just picked out a setting that i liked just as much .
neutral	i don_'_t want you to walk_away from my post thinking that i had a bad_experience , just please do your due_diligence before you purchase online and make_sure it is right for you !
neutral	stick with the higher end carriers ( tnt , ups ) and you will be fine .
neutral	dumb down to yodel or , god_forbid , hermes and you will find yourself in a hell of your own making .
neutral	good luck .
neutral	i do not think you should have to pay shipping charge on a core_return .
neutral	they should send return ticket with product bought
neutral	i '_ve been shopping at redbubble . com for the past two years_now , and for the most part i '_ve been completely_satisfied .
neutral	there '_s only one problem that really sticks out , the graphics stickers printed onto the shirts .
neutral	they fade off fast , have quit a lot of missing spots where ink wasn_'_t filled in , and bright colors often look extremely washed out .
neutral	it '_s a decent enough site , it '_s not a scam , and they ' re prices for most items are reasonable .
neutral	they have a good costumer support_team and processing takes no_longer_than two_days usually .
neutral	dyrt -- og konceptet med selv at kunne vælge sige kanaler holder ikke rigtigt -- der_er mange kanaler man kun kan vælge som " pakkeløsninger og ikke som enkelt kanaler .
neutral	it was good to hear you had stock which is a major problem at the moment , the only down_side was only having a 0000 number which is good on a main telephone line but as most of the trade operate from mobiles we get charged i tired a few_times to try and contact someone but had to give up after 00_mins each time it would be good if we could have direct number after we have placed the order .
neutral	regards
neutral	purchased a drivers_side_mirror for a 0000_mustang and the 0 bolts hole don_'_t even line up in the slightest and the electrical_connector for the power mirrors is the wrong connector .
neutral	advertised wrong on the website !!
neutral	!
neutral	not much to say ...
neutral	they delivered and were ok priced .
neutral	no loyalty programme or reason not to shop around next time ...
neutral	i ordered a 00_lb .
neutral	steel_mace and a pair of 00_lb .
neutral	clubbells .
neutral	the mace arrived in excellent condition , but the clubbell packaging did not survive the journey .
neutral	there was cosmetic_damage to one of the clubbells which didn_'_t affect its use .
neutral	pasyg cheap but coverage only fair
neutral	best price given
neutral	i just today installed the doheny 0 . 0 hp above ground pump to my swimming_pool .
neutral	i immediately noticed that the psi on the filter registered approximately 00_psi ( my original pump - a hayward 0 . 0 hp ) was registering 00_psi ( before it broke ).
neutral	by feeling the water flow i can also tell that the amount of water that the doheny pump is pushing is noticeably less .
neutral	i am_hopeful that this will still be enough to clean up the green mess that accumulated while i was trying to convince my wife that we had to buy a new pump in order to propertly clean up the pool before closing it up for the winter .
neutral	i am using a recently cleaned diatomaceous filter and am_hopeful this new pump will work well with the filtering mechanism .
neutral	i will be adding chlorine to the pool every day ( as instructed by a " pool professional ").
neutral	by the end of the week i should know if the " green soup " is going to be filtered away and thus restore the pool to its " pre broken pump condition .
neutral	".
neutral	i will try to get another review back to you after the cleanup session has_been completed .
neutral	instructions requested that i be rang the day before delivery so i could make the tank accessible .
neutral	instead the call came 0 hr before delivery when i was out of the office anyway .
neutral	luckily i had made the tank accessible anyway .
neutral	this is the second time in a row this happened .
neutral	it took weeks just to get a response and it took weeks just to restock on a key .
neutral	when i asked for a refund they took there time and sent me a key instead of my money .
neutral	i have shopped here in the past and always found what i was looking for , but on my recent order i bought some things that had a core_charge on them and trying to return the core , or in my case a core and some parts , is like pulling_teeth .
neutral	the support_ticket idea is nothing new and a good idea .
neutral	i just wish the person looking them over had something more than a 0th grade intelligence or was at_least a human_being , not a robot because that is the kind of reply i got some pre_- programmed computer_generated email .
neutral	i will try over the phone and hope for a better solution
neutral	tried it out for the first time and found it a little_confusing on how to use it but figured it out .
neutral	i was overcharged by £_00 on the price i was quoted ( and advertised ) for 0 tyres , although after a long conversation with several members of staff i did receive a refund .
neutral	moral of the story ?
neutral	agree on a price before the work is done , get a written quote and you should be okay !
neutral	i don_'_t weant another goddamn username and password for somewhere that i use only occasionally .
neutral	no , it isn_'_t all that obvious how to continue without creating an account .
neutral	b_&_h is better_than many .
neutral	i just happend to explode here after annoyances from other_sites .
neutral	first claim was processed , camera was repaired and returned within a week .
neutral	however , less_than 0_weeks_later , a different problem occurred which may have been the result of the quality of the workmanship and inspection performed as part of the first repair .
neutral	again the claim process was smooth and the repair was done and returned within a week .
neutral	hoping that the repair service was handled better this time and there will be no follow_up issue .
neutral	there was no report stating the diagnosis of the problem and what was repaired .
neutral	excellent performance for communication on status of claim and turnaround time but let_down by lack of information and quality of repair .
neutral	they make a fairly decent product , but the price is just way to high .
neutral	for the same price point , you really should go elsewhere and buy a custom system .
neutral	only if you are lazy or terrible at technology should you go with bose , but then again , you know someone_who can help you , you do , right ?
neutral	i ordered a fog_light for ford_escape , the box is about 00x00x00 , the box that it was shipped in was 00 " x 00x00 , had no other packing_material in it , huge waste or space and shipping fees .
neutral	the price / value combo is hard to beat but when compared to my original wheels , they ' re not an exact_match .
neutral	this probably can '_t be detected except by the most astute observer and won_'_t be a problem if ordering two or four .
neutral	i book flights but ended_up getting the wrong dates and we depart soon and i haven_'_t received any help and i am panicking .
neutral	but they provide a good product .
neutral	thanks
neutral	can not speak to anyone .
neutral	never return phone_calls .
neutral	good parts .
neutral	easer to keep as spares .
neutral	our 0 passenger_van was rated to hold 0 large & 0 small cases -- but with just six of us , it barely held our 0 small cases and hand luggage -- and that was possible only with one person in the very back seat and luggage piled in the adjoining seat to the roof ---- pictures available if you want them .
neutral	when we tried to trade to a larger 0 - passenger_van , none were available for a one - way rental from bristol or bath to heathrow .
neutral	the online price , booking , and payment went very smoothly .
neutral	the problem stated the first night after checking into america best value inn dayton , ohio .
neutral	yes i knew it was a budget low dollar hotel when booking my two night_stay .
neutral	the hotel is old , rundown , and in need of renovations .
neutral	but the rate i got was incredible during a convention weekend so the condition didn_'_t bother me .
neutral	the room was clean but needed a fresh coat of paint .
neutral	( walls were really beat - up ) the problem started at around midnight when a delivery truck showed_up to deliver furniture .
neutral	i guess to renovate the place .
neutral	they decided to unload all this furniture in the empty room next to mine making a huge amount of noise .
neutral	there were about 0 guys unloading this truck all yelling at each other the whole time .
neutral	after a half_hour i had enough and went to the front_desk to complain .
neutral	who schedules a delivery truck at midnight .
neutral	after some arguing with the front_desk person they offered to refund one of my nights , but since i booked and paid through travelocity i would have to contact them for the one night refund .
neutral	now comes the issue with travelocity .
neutral	so the next afternoon i called travelocity and talked ( or tried to talk ) to a call_center with the person on the other who had an accent so thick it made communicating nearly_impossible .
neutral	telling him my store he informed me he would have to contact the hotel to confirm my story .
neutral	well the hotel never answered his calls .
neutral	and he tried 0 times the half_hour we were on the phone .
neutral	he said he would escalate my issue and i would receive an_email in 0 days .
neutral	well after 0 days and no email i called back .
neutral	this time getting a woman with an even thicker accent and could barely_speak_english .
neutral	again i had to repeat my story to this non english_speaking woman_who also tried to call the hotel to confirm my store and again the hotel didn_'_t answer .
neutral	at this point i suspected something fishy was going on and while she was telling_me she would escalate to someone_else and they would contact me i call the hotel and they answered immediately .
neutral	at that point i put us all on a 0 way call .
neutral	the hotel clerk couldn_'_t even understand the travelocity rep . and again i had to tell my story to the hotel clerk who in the end confirmed my story .
neutral	eventually i got my refund , but i had to jump_through some hoops to get it .
neutral	i think there is a serious problem .
neutral	i placed an order in march of this year but i had to do it on my wife '_s laptop which runs windows 0 .
neutral	my windows 0 laptop would not allow me to place the order .
neutral	last_week i tried again to place an order on my windows 0 computer .
neutral	same problem , i had to phone in the order .
neutral	the problem centres around the payment screen which on windows 0 , will not allow entry of method of payment - your very nice sales_person told me on the phone that i should have four options , i only had two .
neutral	it '_s a shame , i like buying from black_circle but after an_hour trying to place an online order , i was pulling my hair out and i was tempted to buy from another supplier .
neutral	product competitively_priced , delivered quickly , well_packaged .
neutral	but ......................................................................... where were the assembly_instructions ?????
neutral	?
neutral	had to wait longer then it says but great 0 wheeler for the price
neutral	it took close to a month to receive the eyeglasses and that is simply too_long .
neutral	the mailing process is particularly flawed .
neutral	the eyeglasses themselves appear to be what was expected .
neutral	we had a mechanic to install the item , but it arrive one day late , and we paid for two day air .
neutral	had to find a different mechanic to install it .
neutral	i bought a rear hub , but found it difficult to communicate with customer service .
neutral	i waited 00 + minutes on hold several_times only to have my call disconnected .
neutral	sure they will email you .
neutral	however the customer service rep only knows_how to respond with 0 word responses .
neutral	received order within allotted_time scale , design of unit could have been better to allow service routing , not all bathrooms have direct access for pipework from the back .
neutral	not as big a saving as i expected .
neutral	you calculate savings from the accumulated balance as of the settlement date , not the balance as of the start date .
neutral	this overstates the savings ..
neutral	very helpful with selection of bulbs to suit my preferences , very fast service , but one bulb arrived shattered into pieces so small that they had escaped the box and contaminated the cushion packaging so that on opening the delivery i had ' powdered ' glass all over the kitchen table .
neutral	in my opinion the packer had put sufficient cushion material between the individual bulb boxes , but each box was directly against the outer_box thereby giving no protection_against shocks in transit .
neutral	maybe re - think packaging guidelines ?
neutral	a replacement bulb foc arrived speedily and intact .
neutral	i shall use them again !
neutral	service works well and as_advertised .
neutral	what is not clear is that if you have an iphone that was once jailbroken / unlocked and the baseband is 00 . 00 . 00 , then apple will not let your phone be unlockedi , wish i was inform of the problems you can encounter , so i could change the base band before upgrading my phone to ios 0 . 0 . 0 which is very hard to change the base band or down grading from .
neutral	i contacted myimeiunlock customer_support , who were very good about getting back to me with a link of how to downgrade the base band wich works with every other ios except the one 0 . 0 . 0 .
neutral	ultimately i was required to downgrade the phone to an_older baseband and then the unlock , after_researching my self and spending a lot of time reading online , and getting a att simcard to unlock it .
neutral	i was expecting a higher quality screw than what i received .
neutral	these are the same screws you can buy at lowes & home_depot .
neutral	i '_m very disappointed .
neutral	0nd day shipping takes 0 days .
neutral	order part wednesday and received on monday .
neutral	shipping sucks .
neutral	good price , but in this case slower_than they should be dispatch .
neutral	find coffee a bit too weak .
neutral	for the price being charge , let '_s not be so stingy with the amount of coffee !
neutral	the sticker i ordered looked great design wise my issue is with the shipping , the sticker came rolled in a box like a roll of duct_tape , because of this all the thin parts of the lettering are wrinkled and creased .
neutral	my other issue is the sticker is fading already after a month i '_m truly unhappy with the service unfortunately my money is gone i suggest you don_'_t make the same mistake
neutral	personalized prepaid_visa_card looked great and arrived quickly to the recipient but i was told that he had to call once to activate the card ( expected ) and then another call to get a pin ( not expected ) - - a little_bit of a hassle .
neutral	also , he said that if he uses the card in a restaurant an automatic 00_% gratuity is added and to use at a gas_station he must go in - - cannot use the card to pay at the pump as you can with a regular visa .
neutral	my assumption was that this card would work just like a regular visa .
neutral	i might have reconsidered had i realized that it didn_'_t .
neutral	very pleased with ease of ordering and contact with customer service afterwards .
neutral	however , even_though i gave specific alternative delivery instructions both in the order and again with a follow_up email which was acknowledged , the delivery company ( dhl ) either did not recieve the instructions or disregarded them .
neutral	as a result the parcel needed to be delivered again one day later which was disappointing .
neutral	we had rodents in our attic and hired critter_control to take_care of the problem .
neutral	they used big vacuums to remove the rodents and old insulation , then secured outside access around our home , sanitized the attic and blew in new insulation .
neutral	they also inspected our duct work and wiring and said it was in good shape .
neutral	the crew arrived a bit late but they were professional and the work was done in one day as_promised .
neutral	it was very expensive !
neutral	our biggest_complaint is their non_existent follow - up service , which was part of the contract .
neutral	the crew left several traps but no one ever came back to check them .
neutral	i called multiple_times but no one ever showed_up .
neutral	we eventually removed the empty traps ourselves and put them in a box in our garage .... where they are still sitting .
neutral	my recent order ( invoice i000000000 )..
neutral	good points :
neutral	.
neutral	arrived in super quick time
neutral	.
neutral	enough bits to fix the shower
neutral	bad points :
neutral	.
neutral	your website encouraged me to buy an extra item i did not need
neutral	.
neutral	you substituted a cheapo crappy ( mercury ) multimeter for the skytro one i ordered .
neutral	quite bad this !
neutral	hope it was a genuine mistake ....
neutral	.
neutral	when i emailed you about a couple of improvements to the instructions included , i got a response implying i should have got a qualified electrician or mira installer or summat !
neutral	well , i am a qualified electrician and the job was simple intrinsically .
neutral	can '_t say i '_ll bother again in future ...
neutral	.
neutral	several days ago i phoned showerdoc who agreed to send me a returns prepaid_envelope as both my issues were your ( their ) fault .
neutral	this hasn_'_t arrived and i will be chasing this tomorrow as you don_'_t open on saturdays .
neutral	.
neutral	all i actually needed to fix my shower was a new solenoid , but i had to purchase the whole valve assembly in 0 parts .
neutral	frustrating and expensive .
neutral	this is not the fault of showerdocs i concede .
neutral	well guys & gals .... you did ask ?
neutral	will i use you again ?
neutral	well that depends on how easy i can return the 0 unwanted parts you sent me and get the correspoding refund .
neutral	still_waiting
neutral	i '_ll continue to use framesdirect . com because of their prices , but the frames i want always seem to be on back order .
neutral	a little frustrating to say the least .
neutral	the game was one day late because it was sent on the same day as the game was released , the info said the game would be sent beforehand so i had it on release .
neutral	i bought a pair of zipp 000s when they arrived there were some slight scratches on the wheels and a lump on the braking surface .
neutral	i would expect better quality from zipp and closer checks from merlin .
neutral	also was surprised they arrived without bags considering the cost
neutral	purely my opinion but a lot of their produce is ' old man ' clothing .
neutral	none of their sizes or cuts really correspond with someone_who is in the same state of health as the models they use to advertise .
neutral	i was advised by an instore tailor and bought an expensive suit from them - since i have learnt more about suits i '_ve learnt it was utter rubbish .
neutral	reasonable quality materials but terrible shape , not machine washable ( according to the tags which were contrary to its advertised design principles ) and just doesn_'_t look right .
neutral	a friend of mine got two suits for 0 / 0s of what i paid from matallan .
neutral	i found it difficult to find correct item for my vehicle .
neutral	i was required to enter vehicle information multiple_times for single search .
neutral	fortunately the item in question is pretty sturdy but it did arrive with damaged packaging .
neutral	products and service are good .
neutral	negative point -- you are asked to join a shipping business to get a better shipping rate .
neutral	of course you have fees to pay .
neutral	i will look for a business that offers better or free shipping in the future .
neutral	sorry
neutral	i was told that the watch had been dispatched then i got this message :
neutral	order 000000 has_been received as a return and is now in the returns processing queue .
neutral	upon_receipt , all returns are examined by two members of staff to determine : the condition of the item in which it has_been received , the nature of the return request and the action to be taken .
neutral	as soon as this has_been done , you will receive a further email as soon as possible to inform you of the status of this return .
neutral	all returns are usually processed on the day they are received but please allow a maximum of 0 days to process from the time of receipt .
neutral	please bear with us until the returns_procedure is complete and you receive the confirmation_email .
neutral	thank_you for shopping with watch shop
neutral	i had never received it though , so i found it strange that it had been returned .
neutral	when i asked what was happening i received this message :
neutral	dear mitchell , its been refunded because of an internal error with the packaging and subsequently has_been returned and refunded .
neutral	you will not be getting the watch now i \' m afraid .
neutral	regards ,
neutral	xxxx
neutral	customer_support
neutral	oh thanks !!
neutral	why wasn_'_t the watch just re - sent ???
neutral	?
neutral	instead i had to get a refund then re - order it .
neutral	i can always seem to find an answer on google , but i worry that this may be the all seeing eye .
neutral	not that i have anything to hide , but i just wonder where my file is .....
neutral	i have never had a bad transaction with paypal .
neutral	i am always confident it is safe and secure .
neutral	when i am on the road i can always count on dominoes to provide a consistant pizza .
neutral	never the best , but certainly never the worst !
neutral	they ' re always a safe choice .
neutral	can '_t deliver a promise on time .
neutral	sat for 0 hours after the time i was told my car would be ready .
neutral	i wrote a review , i got an e_-_mail telling_me how to log in and " easily " edit my review .
neutral	i logged in with a temporary e_-_mail and then had to search for the company i reviewed .
neutral	i edited the review and figured i ' d change my temporary password - nope could not find a place to do that .
neutral	i thought that i would at_least sign out - nope could not find a place to do that .
neutral	if the access was indeed temporary and just for the review , then the password should take me directly to my review and not make me search .
neutral	if it is an invitation to join then the ability to change the password and to log out should be there .
neutral	it is either poorly explained or poorly implemented , i cannot determine which .
neutral	love them but delivery . com does not follow_up with emails like : your order is being_processed , your order is ready , your order is out for delivery .
neutral	not even estimated delivery time , just asap .
neutral	otherwise , a great service .
neutral	i '_ve ordered shaving_soap -- classic brand -- about every six_months it seems , after buying the whole 0 yards to get started with wet_shaving , and the prices go up while the size of the soap gets increasingly smaller .
neutral	these little rounds are laughably tiny --- so , i get it , everybody '_s got to make ends meet .
neutral	but this is disappointing .
neutral	i doubt i '_ll order from classic_shaving again .
neutral	part does not fit , but partsgeek is working to resolve .
neutral	too much email correspondence as we try to resolve .
neutral	i would order from parts_geek if you don_'_t need quick , took a week to ship and my car was down waiting
neutral	i was very satisfied with the delivery time , it came the next_day . the price was also good . the only problem was that i was sent the wrong flavour extend .
neutral	nice 0_star_hotel above a busy cafe / bar , cannot_imagine what size the standard rooms were like if ours was superior .
neutral	disappointed the breakfast was not included , but it was actually well_worth the 00 € when we ate it .
neutral	quiet , parking some 000m away & expensive too .
neutral	lovely walk around jardin du luxembourg just across the road .
neutral	many superb restaurants within a few_minutes walk . very pleasant stay .
neutral	auto_europe did what you were supposed to .
neutral	the reservation was fine , the arrival time was fine .
neutral	the hertz_desk tried to upsell me to a volvo wagon , at an_additional_cost of 000 swiss_francs over four days .
neutral	this is the second time hertz has tried to pull this on me , and i assume they do it with a lot of other people who don_'_t stand their ground .
neutral	please look into this .
neutral	i have rented through auto_europe many_times , and only hertz has tried to pull this stunt .
neutral	thanks .
neutral	love the coffee , love the price but the metal is too thick .
neutral	not sure i will order again , coffee_maker is having a hard time piercing the metal .
neutral	really not to bad for the money , packing could use some work , and my parts fit , price is right , i wasn_'_t expecting factory parts and i got what i payed for and i think in law i would give 0 out of 0
neutral	i ordered the tyres on - line but accidentally got the size wrong .
neutral	i discovered this & emailed black_circles the same day which was a sunday .
neutral	first thing monday_morning i phoned them to check my corrected order had got through but was advised the original order had been despatched and i would have to pay a re - stocking_fee .
neutral	this cancelled the saving i would have made and if i ' d merely gone to the garage for the tyres the problem wouldn_'_t have occurred .
neutral	purhased van rack system via ebay .
neutral	not informed product was out of stock and had to phone to chase order .
neutral	some of the plastic containers conpartment seperaters are twisted .
neutral	broke this part fitting a shower for a friend , looked on your website , found the part ordered it . couple of days it was here , no_problems , fitted it every body happy
neutral	great service in booking car at a great rate - but when arriving at airport ( palma mallorca ) the car_rental company claimed i was not fully_insured ( which argus had assured me i was ) and they demanded i pay additional insurance to cover the cost of breakdown or accidents !
neutral	i declined and could not get any sense from europcar so had a tense week not sure if i was insured or not !
neutral	one more point - europcar '_s policy of paying for a full_tank of petrol then bringing back empty - is obviously designed to make money and not to assist the customer !
neutral	this was my first time to order any type of scuba equipment or gear online .
neutral	i was a little disappointed in the fact they were trying to save a dollar or two from sending out my order twice .
neutral	it took a month and a half to get the first part of my order from them .
neutral	they were out of stock on a certain item , a hood and sock combo that i ordered for me wife .
neutral	they kept pushing it further back and further back until i called and had to tell them i wanted my order regardless if those items didn_'_t come immediately .
neutral	then when i got the order in , there were a few things missing , one of them no big_deal but there were two critical pieces missing in my order that you can '_t use the item without .
neutral	i emailed them about that .
neutral	it took a few_days and they sent them out without_question which was nice .
neutral	the problem here was they did not inform my that my glove i ordered with my light was out of stock and just sent everything .
neutral	i emailed them to ask about the other two pieces and then the glove .
neutral	that is when i was informed that they were temporarily_out and would send everything at once .
neutral	another 00 days goes by and they finally get my hood and sock combo that i ordered in stock and sent that out .
neutral	overall , the customer service is good .
neutral	i know they are a busy company but at what point do you just ship the buyers merchandise without them having to call and tell you to ship it to them when they have waited for a month and a half .
neutral	dell started out so strong and had great products and provided good customer service , but now they are just a so - so company with so - so products and terrible customer service .
neutral	having all of those government contracts won_'_t keep your company afloat forever .
neutral	just visit any u . s . governement facility and you will find dell products on every desk .
neutral	why ?
neutral	because dell provides the lowest cost on the government '_s bid process .
neutral	it doesn_'_t mean dell provides the u . s . government a quality product because they don_'_t , it just means they sell alot of lemons to the government .
neutral	i know because i had to use their sucky products every day .
neutral	their hard_drives were always crashing and locking up .
neutral	and keyboards were always messing up to the point that if you called in for service on a keyboard , the techs would just bring you a new keyboard and toss the old one .
neutral	we bought a 0 day pass .
neutral	on the first day we took the last bus so that we could see the entire route of the red line .
neutral	the taped narrative kept turning off and it never finished a description of a site .
neutral	it would start telling us what we were seeing and then it would just stop .
neutral	often it wouldn_'_t start again for many minutes ( 00 - 00_minutes ).
neutral	the driver hit every bump on every road .
neutral	if you ride up top then be very watchful or you '_ll have your head taken off by low hanging tree limbs .
neutral	seriously .. watch out for this because if you don_'_t , a tree limb will knock your head off .
neutral	the next_day we took the bus again and got off at the capital and we visited several musuems in that area .
neutral	but we had to wait 00_minutes for a bus to pick us up when we left the air and space museum .
neutral	pick_up at the lincoln memorial was only a 00 minute wait .
neutral	after getting on at the lincoln memorial we stayed on the bus until it got back to union station .
neutral	this bus had a human narrator onboard and even_though he was dressed and looked like a bum with his stringy long hair and his shirttail hanging out , his narration and knowledge of washington d . c . and the things we were seeing was very good and his sense of humor was very good and he was friendly .
neutral	but he looked like one of the homeless we had seen sleeping on a bench .
neutral	this company is " so - so " and doesn_'_t make very much of an effort .
neutral	it '_s there and their attitude is kind of , " take us or leave us , we really don_'_t care ."
neutral	the old town trolley '_s ( a competing company ) seemed to pick_up passengers much faster and all of their tours are human narrated .
neutral	both check in and check out went fine .
neutral	it took over an_hour on a saturday_morning to have one leaking tire repaired .
neutral	i '_m ok with that because they warned me in advance .
neutral	my issue is that the young_man that repaired the tire never checked the tire_pressure when he finished .
neutral	when i returned home , i found that the pressure in the tire was significantly overinflated ( the pressure in the untouched tires was fine ).
neutral	i got a plastic shed .
neutral	now the shed is fantastic .
neutral	easy to construct ( assuming that there are 0 of you who have a clue about diy ).
neutral	the instructions were amazingly clear and the shed went up a lot easier than i expected .
neutral	the lost stars are for the poor communication .
neutral	they first sent the wrong confirmation by email .
neutral	then , i was promised delivery within 0_weeks but it took 0_weeks to deliver .
neutral	so , great products but poor delivery times .
neutral	bought three movers and one was a total lemon .
neutral	got parts sent to us the nest day ( great service ) techs were on it , and responsive to the problem .
neutral	in the end we were sent another fixture , at no charge to us , and the warranty was extended , great service .
neutral	no real way to know what you are buying , but it was backed_up by nice people who did not mess_around on the service part .
neutral	we were surprised at how full the buses were .
neutral	some had standing room only and it was not possible to see the sights fully .
neutral	later it was not so bad .
neutral	the live_commentary was excellent as was the recorded one .
neutral	we would certainly use the service again but maybe in the winter it would be good to have a fully roofed top_deck as it was cold !
neutral	!
neutral	very good price and very quick delivery ( replacement compatible heads for oral - b electric toothbush ).
neutral	however , was a bit_concerned to find the inner core of bristles missing and am not sure how affects the cleaning .
neutral	have been using the first head for 00 days now and bristles are wearing ok , ie .
neutral	no worse than the originals .
neutral	the head was initially very tight on the holder which overloaded the motor .
neutral	getting freer with use but the batteries still need recharging more often than normal .
neutral	will this cause the battery_pack to fail in the long - term ?
neutral	a new unit would cost more than the saving on cheaper heads so not sure that i would buy these heads again .
neutral	the parts i received were exactly_what i ordered but i ordered them on a thursday_afternoon i paid 00 sum dollars for next_day air shipping and i never received them till tuesday the next week
neutral	if your a beginning entrepreneur its really hard to start a business with the high cost of equipment .
neutral	the cost is too high and the results reflect this overpricing .
neutral	prices of appliances are great however the customer care experience is only average .
neutral	i had to make contact to find out the delivery date only to discover one item was out of stock .
neutral	overall not bad !
neutral	some of the packages were not sealed completely
neutral	parts_geek usually_ships parts quickly .
neutral	the trouble is that they don_'_t send you an_email with tracking_information so you have no_clue when your parts will arrive .
neutral	my last eat order shipped from two warehouses .
neutral	the first shipment arrived in three_days .
neutral	the second shipmend has not arrived after a week and a half .
neutral	frustrating .
neutral	the van wasn_'_t so bad , but it did not handle as well or drive as comfortably as the sedan i ' d reserved .
neutral	it had lots of romm , but we were only two .
neutral	the diesel sipped fuel with adequet power .
neutral	the large turning radius and oversized sight obstructing b pillar were constant annoyances .
neutral	like i said the flowers were awesome , but they called my girlfriend asking her to come pick them up .
neutral	which i thought was unacceptable .
neutral	she didn_'_t seem to mind but i did and i was the one who was paying well over a hundred_dollars .
neutral	my girlfriend is everything to me , i just wished they had thought the same .
neutral	like i said the flowers were great .
neutral	maybe they were just having a bad day , we all have them from time to time .
neutral	well friend your product is good but i feel it could be better --- like a ouicker delivery to our friends sometimes it takes 0 days , not good enough --- if you could use a credit_card system to make it instant payment --- now that would be good for all partys --- and a notification to the receivers when the money is there waiting to be picked_up --- thats about all i have to say --- thank_you for the chance to respond ....
neutral	before i used them i read alot or reviews stating that you had do a lot of identity verification ,
neutral	and they were right .
neutral	my problem was ( skrill ) the credit_card processing co . did not let_me use my email addresss ,
neutral	so i used my alternate email , and it set off a red_flag .
neutral	after getting an answer back from support 00_hours_later ,
neutral	i had to send them an_email from my alternate email address .
neutral	well that email was setup as a forward address ,
neutral	so i had to edit my dns server '_s mx records ,
neutral	and setup an_email account for it .
neutral	finally got that out of the way , and cjs_cd_keys no_longer had my game in stock ,
neutral	so i had to wait for that , finally 00_hours_later i got game key .
neutral	it is a really bad picture of the game key ,
neutral	it took my 00 tries of guessing what it was before steam accepted it .
neutral	btw all the v '_s looked like t '_s in the picture .
neutral	anyway ,
neutral	i will probably use them again because people say the first purchase is like this ,
neutral	so i will give it another shot when i buy a new game .
neutral	if it goes bad i will never use this again .
neutral	i did save $_00 . 00 on my purchase .
neutral	so if money is more important then the time it takes ,
neutral	then well_worth it , if you want to instantly download your game ,
neutral	buy on steam , or origin .
neutral	fyi : make_sure the game key is in stock also ,
neutral	that will not guarentee you will get it though ,
neutral	by the time you get to view your key , it will be sold out .
neutral	they do not hold your purchase untill everything is verified .
neutral	i would recommend cjs_cd_keys ,
neutral	but keep in mind it may take a while to get your keys .
neutral	you will save a lot of money .
neutral	i have repeatedly tried to order products online , without_success .
neutral	i wish you could offer an online experience as smooth as amazon .
neutral	perhaps i should order my compression sleeves from them .
neutral	your site will not accept my established pw , and will not allow me to re - set it .
neutral	i have ordered many items from you , but am only successful when i wait for a live customer service person .
neutral	i will provide my email address in case you want to help me get established with an online account .

neutral	the beehive assembly with a lot of pieces and poor instructions was at best a challenge .
neutral	i thought i was getting wiring_harness with bulbs olso .
neutral	.
neutral	instead i only received lens cover .
neutral	i would recamend you if your shipping was better i still_havent got my package yet .
neutral	everything was fine , except there was a missing rubber boot for one of the ball_joints .
neutral	i have shopped through iwantpants . com for years_now because of the range , and the regular and generous discounts offered .
neutral	you can make some huge_savings with these_guys , but boy do you have to work hard for it .
neutral	the time it takes to get to finalise your payment and place your order could test the patience of a saint .
neutral	the longer i have navigated the site , the more it freezes and locks up .
neutral	i have to leave the site , refresh and even close safari altogether .
neutral	at times i have just given up altogether , but when you are offered up to 00_%_off , who can resist ?
neutral	after so much grief , i took the time to contact iwantpants . com a while back to inform them of all the troubles i ' d had , but it seemingly fell on deaf_ears , as no response was had .
neutral	so ultimately , if you are a patient person and hungry for a bargain but know how to manage your expections given what you pay ( service wise ), give it a go .
neutral	some great products on offer at times .
neutral	i must start by saying that i have rented form auto_europe canada several_times and their rates and service are the best and i do not_hesitate to recommend auto_europe to friends travelling in europe .
neutral	however , i just rented a car from europcar in rome .
neutral	i asked for directions from the termine where i was picking_up the car .
neutral	i was told they do not have maps or give directions but the car had a gps .
neutral	we waited 00_minutes for the car to arrive .
neutral	the driver said that he was late because he had to fill it with gas .
neutral	i asked_him to show me the gps and he said , i do not know about it and it is in french and he ran off .
neutral	the car indeed had french plates and was dirty outside and in .
neutral	after driving to puglia ( 0 hours ) and parking the car , i went to start it again and i could not get the keys into the ignition .
neutral	phoning the office in rome , and giving them the plate number , i was told that they had never_heard of that car and could not help me .
neutral	another call with the contract number i was told to phone europcar emergency service .
neutral	explaining the problem and verifying that i did indeed have a car from them , we proceeded to start the process of getting a service truck to get to us when the lady said " you have a french peugot , sometimes the steering wheels lock and keep you from getting the keys in .
neutral	try twisting the steering_wheel ."
neutral	that was the solution .
neutral	something i think my first 0 calls to rome could have solved .
neutral	i travel to italy twice a year and i will_continue to rent from auto_europe and europcar ( although never again in rome ).
neutral	however , another experience like this may change my mind .
neutral	specs completed manufacture and quality control in four days .
neutral	they sat in dispatch for five days because corporate orders get preference hence a huge backlog .
neutral	after sending , held up by hong_kong post for four days .
neutral	went to sydney instead of brisbane so i had to arrange extra freight from sydney .
neutral	a very costly exercise .
neutral	their e_mails always claim they are right and the customer is wrong .
neutral	spectacles and lenses fine but service leaves a lot to desired since they became part of omnioptics .
neutral	i ordered a drivers_side window_motor and when i recieved it , its motor set_up was all backwards , i had to do some fabricating to make it work .
neutral	no one but me knows that it is mounted a little different from the original and it works just fine .
neutral	i just don_'_t understand_why it couldn_'_t be as easy as take the old one out and put the new one in .
neutral	oh well , it was the best priced i could find online .
neutral	price was the best in the world , but the shipping took_longer_than_expected .
neutral	package tracking kept saying two day delivery but that turned_out to be seven , but other than that very pleased ...
neutral	they need to update their content and provide better information .
neutral	user ratings make little sense .
neutral	no data published to back up user ratings .
neutral	website fails to work time and time again
neutral	i ordered some parts for my 0000_audi s0 and the experience was pleasant and the order was filled to almost satisfactory needs .
neutral	i have one part that was not what i ordered and i '_ve been trying for the past week to get it returned .
neutral	i '_m not sure if a rma is needed for the return or if i just send it back without notifying partsgeek . com .
neutral	any how , i hope that this little problem will be resolved soon .
neutral	the company and shipping process are both wonderful , and the concept is excellent , but i see a couple of flaws - perhaps if i point them out , the end product can be improved on .
neutral	it would be fantastic if there were not only dog / cat boxes , but minor profiles so that the contents can more closely match the pet / s it is being shipped to .
neutral	examples - dog - large dog ?
neutral	small dog ?
neutral	young_adult ?
neutral	older adult ?
neutral	puppy ?
neutral	likewise - cat - young_adult ?
neutral	kitten ?
neutral	older adult ?
neutral	reasons - a small dog toy would not be appropriate for a large dog , and while small dogs may be able to play with large dog toys , there would be the option for them to choose the small dog spoiled pet box , to get appropriate sized items ... if you sent a small toy to a large dog , there would be a chance for them to swallow it , causing issues .
neutral	if you send a teeny rawhide to a large dog , same issue .
neutral	kittens / young_adult cats - far more playful than older adults typically , an_older cat might like a nap blanket , a brush , some tasty treats - a younger cat would like toys , tasty treats .
neutral	you could also include age appropriate supplements if you added this to your profile .
neutral	in my last box ,
neutral	just a few thoughts to improve upon something that is already pretty fantastic .
neutral	you could also get some profile information on the humans , then you could include a random promotional human product as well , say a t - shirt or magnet ...
neutral	thanks !

neutral	i orderd about three_weeks a go some e_- juice and few clearomizers and still_haven_'_t got those .
neutral	i '_m getting a bit_nervous that where is the package : s ...
neutral	difficult to set_up with google_voice
neutral	i ordered 0 items only got 0 and one i did get broke within 0 minutes . just glad nothing was very expensive .
neutral	i will order again
neutral	seemed to be a great deal at first until i saw total bill but i will check other_sites now and try and find cheaper deals for my pattaya leg of trip .
neutral	i hope the hotel is true to the pictures shown .
neutral	the last two times i have booked my car in ( online ) at direct parking glasgow ,
neutral	the the booking confirmation i received had defaulted my booking travel date - to the day of booking date , which_meant further action - calls to correct the bookings .
neutral	once could be a blip , twice - not so good !
neutral	the checkout was interrupted , had to wait a day to finish the order .
neutral	it didn_'_t recognize my password .
neutral	i had to clilck 000 times to get it reset .
neutral	not b_&_h '_s best day !
neutral	framesdirect had me fill_out a waiver so that the shipping company wouldn_'_t need a signature to leave the parcel at my residence .
neutral	however , they did not transmit this information to the shipping company , and so it couldn_'_t be left .
neutral	this made getting a hold of the package very difficult .
neutral	if you have a problem you can go from page a to b to c to a ... etc
neutral	they have many restrictions which are not very clear .... like using an account in multiple countries ... when you do so your a /_c gets restricted ... and you try unlimiting it if you are not in your home country with access to up to date records , like id .
neutral	i have lost money that was paid to me because of this : it has disappeared into a black_hole .
neutral	but in the ebay world they have a monopoly ( but the ebay is the owner isn_'_t it ), so i guess it will never be improved .
neutral	the site has not funtioned properly for years : there are many small problems .
neutral	also the hostel list is not maintained in a timely_fashion .
neutral	but a good organisation . c
neutral	nowhere_near as good as google .
neutral	i love shopping on mcm but find it hard to believe that the shipping_charges are so much being that centerville is only an_hour or so from columbus .
neutral	it '_s what keeps me from wanting to shop any more w_/ this site .
neutral	purchased softbank japan unlock - 00 november_0000 .
neutral	unlock was not possible - they stopped any status_updates after 0 feb 0000 .
neutral	after following through with email_addresses found on this web_site and and others i could get marked for a refund .
neutral	they had some problems with automatic processing , so after manually processing the refund i have received it .
neutral	i booked the pick_up days before and the courier never even turned_up to pick it up - i finish work at half past four but stayed late as no one arrived - called on monday and they came on monday
neutral	i have never seen an african american broascaster on that website rank anywhere_near the top 00 or even the top 000 .
neutral	it doesn_'_t even have to be an african american model , it would be anyone_else that '_s never gotten that chance .
neutral	the top models i see are charging over $_000 worth of tokens just to get them nude .
neutral	that '_s terrible .
neutral	if you '_ve ever watched parislovely , you know what a whiny little money hungry bitch is .
neutral	rich members on that site think those girls are their friends and should take the time to look through the pages and they would find models much more beautiful with much nicer personalities .

neutral	this website was very hard initially when trying to buy cards with a credit_card .
neutral	nothing would process if one thing was slightly off .... middle initial , phone_number , etc , and your never sure why so its a process of elimination guessing game .
neutral	now the issue is when you try to purchase predesigned gift_cards in the birthday category , they are lumped in with christmas designs or other designs .
neutral	the predesigned categories are not categorized !
neutral	frustrating !
neutral	feb 0000 .
neutral	i ordered a new , updated version of an led product , which was advertised on the website .
neutral	when the item was delivered , ( very promptly ) it was the old version , which was a lower spec .
neutral	when i contacted the branch , there was initial suggestions that i had ordered the incorrect item , but after persevering , it was confirmed that there was no stock of the version i wanted .
neutral	the returns process would have required me to stay in all day awaiting a courier , which i wasnt happy to do , so to their credit , the staff arranged for a partial_refund , and i kept the lower spec item .
neutral	overall , disappointed , but i would probably shop_here again .
neutral	i only received 0 items when i ordered a 0 pack of cartridges at 00 . 00 .
neutral	no packing_slip or order confirmation with delivery or promise to send third cartridge .
neutral	i waited a couple days and e_- mailed company , but got no response . i '_m sure they will contact me or send cartridge soon . i don_'_t wish to make a big_deal out of a simple mistake .
neutral	my order # was 0000000 - feb . 00 , 0000 .
neutral	when we arrived at the avis_counter in madrid at the airport , i overheard the agent tell the customer that hisreservation was basic and did not cover anything including roadside assistance , meaning if the car breaks_down the customer must foot the bill for the towing .
neutral	when it was my turn i asked if our reservation included road side assistance adn he said it did not , i told_him this was ridiculous .
neutral	in other_words , if the car breaks_down through no fault of ours , we are responsible for the cost of the towing and he said yes and we relented and paid 0 euros extra per day for the road side .
neutral	in bilbao , next to where we were staying was an avis office and they said this was wrong and reimbursed us .
neutral	can '_t understand what this was about ?
neutral	left bad_taste in mouth for avis .... otherwise autoeurope is fine .
neutral	square_trade did repair my ipad
neutral	problem is it took 0_weeks and the employee i talked to told me if apple said it couldn_'_t be fixed ( which they did ) then square_trade would just refund purchase price .
neutral	i jumped the gun and bought new ipad air ( my own fault ) and eventually the broken ipad showed_up repaired - apple now will not support the ipad because service was performed by 0rd_party ....
neutral	they did cover the original issue , unfortunately future issues loom ahead .
neutral	we purchased a wall mounted cabinet and it had front and back profiles , following on from the purchase i wanted to order some shelves and asked which ones would fit - i was advised some would fit provided the cabinet had rear profiles which it did and they were listed as a related product against the cabinet .
neutral	although i double_checked they were compatible and was advised they could be returned if incompatible as it was not my fault , i was granted a return but told to return them at my cost .
neutral	only after a few e_-_mails was a collection arranged .
neutral	i was then told only a modem shelf would fit in the cabinet i had ordered and questioned why a universal shelf would not fit that could be adjusted with a cabinet that had front and back profiles and was just told " it will not fit ".
neutral	i decided to order two anyway and they fitted a treat .
neutral	we have used comms_express a few_times and found the service to be fine but this was the first time we have needed to return something or have some sales advice .
neutral	it is possible , that i am the winner of an auction and the seller does not want to sell , which is against the rules .
neutral	but ebay did not manage , that persons are excluded from ebay , if they break rules .
neutral	the registry of new persons should be proved better .
neutral	so there are fake bidders without an existing address , which bid to their own offer to rise the price .
neutral	ebay prefers to have a maximum of users , even if some break necessary rules .
neutral	if you have troubles with rule - breaking sellers , ebay doesn_'_t help as necessary .
neutral	be_careful if you bid on ebay !
neutral	the room was okay , but not superior .
neutral	the tv was small and old and only german channels .
neutral	the toilet has a bath , but no shower , and there was a bad smell from the drain .
neutral	there were only 00_minutes free internet per day .
neutral	the car_park was expensive .
neutral	00 € / 00_hours
neutral	the cleaning was very good .
neutral	the restaurant " franke " was excellent .
neutral	the service in the reception was super .
neutral	the service was good , the product was mediocre at best ... but i '_m not going to dog parts_geek for the ill fitting bumper i ordered .
neutral	do wish they could some how get other reviews about how well things fit ... but overall , i would order from them again .
neutral	the site is easy to use , and they are very competitive with there pricing
neutral	. lk ; kl ; kl ; k ;_lk ;_lk ; lkl ; k ; k ;_lk ;_lk ;_lk ;_lk ; l
neutral	on my return even_though the flight was on time and i phoned them to say i was leaving the baggage area , they were not expecting me and i had to wait in the rain for a good 00 - 00_minutes .
neutral	alao it would be nice if the system automatically issue you a vat_receipt .
neutral	well you would think if you had an am appointment , and you called before you went down to have them fitted , then you were kept 0 . 0 hours before the car went in the tyre bay .
neutral	the item i bought was described as a replacement for a genuine_hp_ink_cartridge but was incompatible with the printer a replacement was sent but had the same problem so in the end i purchased a genuine_hp cartridge 00_% more than the copy and it was fine so make up your own mind about which one to buy .
neutral	have been attempting to update my billing credit_card for a month now & system will not allow it ..." try again later ..." i have two credit_cards , both with ample credit limits , iihave credit_scores avg 000 +, but id_guard won_'_t accept my cards .
neutral	lifelock , here i come ............
neutral	this is my second_pair of prescription_glasses from frames_direct .
neutral	the prices are really good and ordering is easy .
neutral	my first pair of glasses were perfect , the fit , the look , the price and the quick dleivery .
neutral	my most_recent pair were priced right and i received them quickly , but they look horrible on me and i wish i could return them .
neutral	i '_m only wearing them while_driving and go " blind " at the office .
neutral	i hate wearing them in public .
neutral	they appeared to be very similiar to my last pair but they ' re not even close .
neutral	the treatment was still worthwhile and although according to the eye_tests i have 00 : 00 vision , i find that my vision can still be quite poor at times particularly of a night time .
neutral	i am still having to buy eyedrops every month to prevent the dry eyes .
neutral	optimax should consider issuing these free for as long as they are needed as per what one of their competitors do .
neutral	well as for my experience , i would give it a 0 cause it was pretty long before i got my cd - key .
neutral	but i do have to put into_consideration the time difference cause i '_m staying in the united_states .
neutral	service was good , but kind of slow .
neutral	overall i '_m very satisfied and will surely buy again .
neutral	kudos !
neutral	thank_you for your great prices .
neutral	toate bune si frumoase dar ma deranjat un lucru si anume , dupa_ce am_facut comanda on line a trebuit eu sa sun a doua_zi pt confirmare si acelasi lucru s - a intamplat si_la livrare cu toate ca mi_se promisese ca voi fi sunat . daca nu sunam sa intreb cand imi pot ridica coletul probabill ca eram catalogat un client neserios .
neutral	i don_'_t want to get too critical but i felt_like it took_longer_than it should have to get my package shipped out .
neutral	it took almost a week before receiving tracking .
neutral	it may be the distributors fault i '_m not sure but other wise i am happy .
neutral	products delivered in good time ( at good price too ), though one of the two apparently identical rackets was wrong_size grip .
neutral	issue quickly resolved by staff .
neutral	however , the two rackets i ended_up with , both strung by tennisnuts to supposedly identical tension , are at quite different levels ( i ' d guess around 0lb variation ).
neutral	not the end of the world , but also far from perfect for a premium stringing upgrade .
neutral	i ordered some air shocks and they would not process the order and ship without calling me to verify that it was really me , using my credit_card .
neutral	then they canceled my original order and re - entered a new one .
neutral	not sure why all of this was necessary since they used the same credit_card information .
neutral	this delayed shipment by a few_days and created some problems on my end .
neutral	there was no way to call them , i just had to wait_until they responded to my support_ticket and called me .
neutral	would i do it again ?
neutral	probably , because their prices were great - but now at_least i know what to expect .
neutral	bought a pair of fulcrum_racing zero wheels as they were under aud $_0k .
neutral	this is important as anything over $_0k attracts duty in australia which must be paid before you can collect your order .
neutral	however this all came unstuck when merlin put the value of the item at $ 0000 which_meant that i had to deal with customs and convince them that i paid less_than $_0k .
neutral	in essence this was a lot of hassle and meant that it took 00 days before i received my wheels .
neutral	i am happy with the wheels and the price but all this hassle could have easily been avoided if the correct price was put on the customs declaration .
neutral	when i placed my order , i was routed to the printing . com office based in chorley .
neutral	we popped in to make_sure our flyers were ok and the manager was quite rude stating that our logo was out of date and the flyer was not very professional .
neutral	she then offered to come up with a few suggestions and asked us to call back later in the week which we did .
neutral	she then stated that she " couldn_'_t dedicate any time " to us until we ' d paid an_additional £_000 for her help .
neutral	i asked for some examples of what she can do to see whether it was worth it .
neutral	she typed our business name and simply changed the fonts each time .
neutral	i said i '_m not paying £_000 for someone to change the font and wanted to proceed with our original design .
neutral	she then told us that by having a map on the back of the flyers to show people where we are was " counter - productive and not professional ".
neutral	i tried changing the order to the branch at bolton and the team there was extremely_helpful and couldn_'_t find anything wrong with our flyers .
neutral	i certainly won_'_t be using the branch in chorley again that '_s for certain .
neutral	i '_ll be using the branch in bolton from now on !!
neutral	!
neutral	it was easy enough to find what i was looking for and order .
neutral	however , there were no shipping options .
neutral	i had no_idea how long it would take until after i placed my order .
neutral	everything was good except u got onething wrong , but not bad of all the stuff ive ordered from you !
neutral	good to use every time
neutral	great deals , awful user_interface .
neutral	package ordered took 00 days to arrive , slowest shipping i have experienced .
neutral	book was fine enough quality for used .
neutral	nice prices .
neutral	my first order took a while to be completed though .
neutral	we used direct roofing to replace fascias and guttering prior to moving in to our house we bought in dyserth , north wales .
neutral	all looked well at first and we paid via direct bank_transfer after several pushy phone_calls on the day we went to check the work .
neutral	however after closer_inspection we noticed a few faults : cracked fascia board ; downspout completely away from gutter ( i fell_off a stepladder trying to re - attach it , but it had obviously been forced to fit !
neutral	); wrong elbow joint fitted between gutter and downspout so it leaks when it rains : poor joint between gutter and downspout which keeps coming apart .
neutral	despite numerous phone_calls and promises to rectify these faults over the last 0 to 0_weeks nothing has happened .
neutral	it would probably take them about 0 hour to put right !
neutral	our invoice states a 00 year_guarantee , but we ' re not holding our breath ....
neutral	i '_ve used cheapsmells before and been happy with both price and standard delivery .
neutral	this time i was happy with price and paid_extra for a quick delivery but was disappointed when the package didn_'_t arrive within a couple of days as i expected it to .
neutral	complained and was pointed to the small_print which stated that delivery wasn_'_t guaranteed and to wait up to 0 days before chasing !
neutral	felt a bit conned about the misleading way delivery options appear on the website .
neutral	other than that no problem
neutral	we booked a hotel stay in sf 0 days ago with this company , and hotel has said we do not have a reservation with any of the confirmation number or the reference_number on the voucher olotel has provided .
neutral	i have contacted customer service many_times and olotel states they are " working on it ".
neutral	update -
neutral	after several emails back and forth , and writing areview at this stie , late today i did receive the correct confirmation number to verify with the hotel that we have a valid reservation .
neutral	thank_you olotel for geting this straightened_out promptly .
neutral	john wiebe
neutral	my part was defective .
neutral	the return dept replied in a reasonable time frame .
neutral	unfortunately , the return instructions were somewhat unclear but the ups delivery came and picked_up the defected part but i have not received a replacement or refund yet .
neutral	turn_around times for replacements and / refunds could improve .
neutral	gave up on the speedicath and went back to the other catheter .
neutral	it appears that the speedicath diameter is larger .
neutral	also the other catheter had a coude tip which is easier to use .
neutral	recently i ordered a frame only ( as replacement for an old one ).
neutral	the people were very assistant .
neutral	the order process went fine and the correct material was delivered in short time .
neutral	so_far so good .
neutral	what i do not understand : i live in switzerland and i ordered at smartbuyglasses . ch and i '_ve paid in swiss_francs - but nevertheless i had to pay customs - service - fee and vat !
neutral	i acually contacted the swiss - site to avoid this .
neutral	there should be a hint about this .
neutral	had two orders not process .
neutral	nobody could tell me why even_though they received a invoice number .
neutral	great prices but trying to get in touch with the company is very hard and frustrating .
neutral	i bought a luk_clutch_kit and flywheel from partsgeek .
neutral	prices were great .
neutral	the shipping was fast .
neutral	only_negative is the alignment tool for the clutch_kit was busted in many parts , it was apparent that the box was dropped in shipping .
neutral	the clutch looked undamaged .
neutral	waited almost 0_weeks for package to be sent after signing_up and in the process of filing the application on - line i decided to continue the process over the phone being hesitant of transporting all my sensitive information electronically as it stated i could do on the bottom of the instruction package i received in the mail . however after waiting on hold for ten_minutes and then transferred to another dept . who also kept me on hold for another few i was told this information could not be given over the phone only over the internet and that the paper instructing to do this was obsolete . not a good first_impression at all . giving this company a second thought now ..... update ** 0 / 00 / 00 - reply to this review was someone would contact me to discuss it . one month later , still_waiting ..
neutral	not able to use autofill for address info
neutral	working with the website was fun and easy .
neutral	i did get a little_nervous after_reading some bad_reviews of the website but everything worked out okay .
neutral	the cards arrived one day late but look really good .
neutral	now let '_s see if they work .
neutral	normally have had great experiences w them .
neutral	had a problem initially trying to register on their website so called to make the reservation and person was very helpful .
neutral	issue yesterday was the return from the airport - there were 0 or 0 groups on our trip back and when going to pay there was only 0 guy working the desk who also was taking incoming phone_calls - cant blame him but you would expect a minimum of 0 folks working so i had to wait 00 - 00_mins to pay - as you know its nice to get in and out quickly but this was not the case .
neutral	there was another gentleman near the desk inside but apparently he was not trained to to check outs - perhaps some cross training would have been helpful in this situation .
neutral	tried 0 times and the server kept kicking me off .
neutral	poor follow - up by your company .
neutral	kept checking the website for shipping information , it showed " warehouse " until i actually received my order !
neutral	turn_around is unbearably slow
neutral	as long as you ' re not in a hurry they have some of the best prices .
neutral	i was told i would be getting a suite , but was given a standard room .
neutral	i liked the room , and customer service resolved the pricing so it all worked out in the end .
neutral	you '_ll have better luck finding the part on another website and then locating it on 0wd if it happens to be cheaper .
neutral	i was pleased with the discount percentages and the wide varying amounts that you have , but shipping was extremely slow .
neutral	when i called you to inquire as to the delay ( after 0 days ) and was assured that my card had been shipped out on the date the website claimed .
neutral	i was told first_class postage is 0 - 00 days .
neutral	per the usps . com site first_class postage is listed as 0 - 0 days for most places .
neutral	the card was being shipped from pennsylvania to maryland !!
neutral	it took 00 days total !?
neutral	?
neutral	i can only assume that the information i was given when i called was incorrect .
neutral	i can '_t say definitively that i was being lied to regarding the time frame , but maybe the giftcard . com rep i spoke with was ..." mistaken ".
neutral	total experience was a 0 . 0_stars , but the rating_system only allows whole stars .
neutral	it took_longer to change my reservation because the person_who helped_me had such an accent she was hard to understand .
neutral	she finally got the job_done so all is ok .
neutral	i have a feeling nobody even works there .
neutral	tried to call them multiple_times but just sat on hold for hours .
neutral	tried to email them took two_days for a response .
neutral	might be a good place if your not in a hurry but terrible place to shop if you count on speedy service .
neutral	sent shipping info to fed - ex yet fed - ex didn_'_t get the package for days .
neutral	your promo_code 000 is a joke i think .
neutral	it said save 000 for flight and hotel , but it didn_'_t apply .
neutral	next time i won_'_t fall for it .
neutral	instead i will check other company .
neutral	for a $_00 item , they charged $_00 for freight .
neutral	asked them to send it by usps which would have cost not more than $_00 .
neutral	instead they shipped by ups 0nd day air .
neutral	my shipping instructions were even printed on the invoice , they just didn_'_t follow them !
neutral	won_'_t do that again .
neutral	bought mirrors from them .
neutral	they were garbage .
neutral	not broken but just junk .
neutral	shouldn_'_t really be sold .
neutral	i have used identity_guard for years_now , which has_been great , and when i got married i added an account for my wife .
neutral	however when her account was created they needed a copy of our marriage certificate to prove the name change .
neutral	they called us several_times and asked us to fax in a copy of the document , which we did at_least three_times ( with fax confirmation ).
neutral	apparently nobody checks for faxes because they kept calling and then eventually cancelled her membership .
neutral	i '_m in the process of getting the membership restored but the fact they cancelled her membership ( which we '_ve been paying monthly for ) over a marriage certificate may be one of the dumbest things i '_ve ever heard of .
neutral	very unhappy customer right now .
neutral	had some flowers delivered for my nans 00th_birthday certainly were not the best i have had from you , they were a bit worst for wear when my nan got them at 0 . 00pm .
neutral	i think when you are dealing_with auto_parts you need to be able to pick_up a phone and talk to someone live like right now , not send an e_mail or fax and get an e_mail 0 days_later , i also think you need to ditch fed_ex smart post it is a horrible service parts come to oregon 0 miles from my home then get sent to kent washington !!
neutral	then back !!
neutral	smart post is stupid once again smart post is horrible i ordered 0 other parts from another company way farther away and got them yesterday , where are the smart post parts ??
neutral	lol who_knows .
neutral	why would you as a company try to save litterally a couple dollars on shipping ?
neutral	now i have all the parts but the one from you because you used horrible smart post , this is the last time i order from you .
neutral	when i was having online_chat with the staff_member , they took so long to reply and if u ask them more question they some how don_'_t reply .
neutral	overall the product was amazing , tastes wicked , best have it after a hard core workout , absorbs very quickly in ur body , no side_effects .
neutral	very fast delivery .
neutral	i m not that happy with customer service .
neutral	please improve .
neutral	staff seems to be quite rude .
neutral	there is no phone_number to reach them .
neutral	still_waiting to get a return email about returning the core .
neutral	the part arrived_promptly and in good condition .
neutral	not sure if i would purchase from them or not .
neutral	their prices are low , which is great , but again , no customer service .
neutral	i reserved a unit at a great price .
neutral	the manager called first thing the next_morning , only to inform_me they no_longer had an available storage_unit in the size i reserved .
neutral	i did recieve all the correct parts , the one problem i had was there is no way to contact parts_geek
neutral	i had a phone_power line and was happy .
neutral	then i ordered another line .
neutral	my line was very choppy .
neutral	the tech_support was very rude and not very helpful .
neutral	they were blaming my internet provider and my fax_machine .
neutral	but never fixed the problem .
neutral	i cannot access the fax capabilities .
neutral	i got more upload and download stream on my internet provider .
neutral	but still there is no improvement on my line .
neutral	it is a good home line .
neutral	if you want to keep as a extra line for a grandparent or a teenager it is great .
neutral	but not for regular use or home base business use .
neutral	but i am in a one year contract .
neutral	so i got stuck .... be_careful when you get this phone line
neutral	everything was fine , service great ets , etc but the skotia beading was missing when the fitter arrived ( even_though it was on order ) requiring a trip to homebase .
neutral	to be fair , refund was immediate and it may have been a courier problem rather_than flooring supplies .
neutral	so good , but ...
neutral	the part needed a special socket , 00 mm axel socket .
neutral	it would be nice if you told me that .
neutral	the " one size fits all " order and fulfillment process is flawless and quick .
neutral	i received my part in 0 days , it was exactly_what i ordered and the price was the best i found anywhere .
neutral	the second time i used parts_geek there was a credit_card issue .
neutral	the system - generated email said i ' d be contacted in 0 days .
neutral	.
neutral	.
neutral	didn_'_t happen .
neutral	i cancelled the transaction through my bank and re - ordered the part at parts_geek .
neutral	the order is incorrect and incomplete .
neutral	now i get to find out how their return process works / doesn_'_t work .
neutral	don_'_t mind the idea of text_messages , phone_calls & emails to keep me informed of when to expect delivery of my order .
neutral	however , appliances_online was over the top !
neutral	they need to do a review of appropriate contact frequency & adjust accordingly .
neutral	after receiving my order ( which i have absolutely no_complaints about ), they now email me every day - i '_ve had 0 emails already today , saturday , & it '_s only 0 o ' clock , asking me what i think about them !!
neutral	my advice would be - " be_careful what you ask for !"
neutral	i would order from them again , but please take_note of my comments .
neutral	tried to stop order before shipping on a sunday to no_avail .
neutral	payed for 0 day shipping and it still took 0 days business days .
neutral	did not recieve until friday .
neutral	i did not get a confirmation_email of an order placed until 00_hrs after_placing the order when most vendors acknowledge the placed order through email almost immediatly after completing transaction .
neutral	prices are cheap but be sure you do not change the order because you are on your own after that regardless of contacting them before order sorting .
neutral	there certainly no delay in accepting funds immediatly after order was placed regardless of the lack of order confirmation .
neutral	the location was great , right near the longest bar in the world .
neutral	near the breweries and restaurants .
neutral	the smell that came out of the bathroom was terrible .
neutral	they seem so helpful and so easy , however eveything must be dealt_with directly with the hotel anyway which only makes its more difficult since you booked through a third_party .
neutral	tried to change my reservations through travelocity only to get an_unknown error .
neutral	i canceled my reservations and a week_later travelocity sends me emails about my itinerary to fargo , nd , even_though my reservations were for detroit lakes , mn .
neutral	cannot rate til am safely in my undamaged car again and driving home
neutral	i have always had good service from oldies . com until my latest order .
neutral	an item that i ordered was out of stock and i did not learn of this until i received the rest of my order a week_later .
neutral	there was a notation on the invoice that the company does not place items on back - order or notify the customer when the order . is placed .
neutral	during christmas shopping season , a week '_s delay can sometimes cause problems .
neutral	is it really too much effort to send an_email ?
neutral	most priceline hotels i '_ve stayed at tack on a bs ' resort_fee ' or parking charge .
neutral	so you think you '_ve gotten a decent price only to find out it '_s higher_than_expected .
neutral	i have been using interparcel frequently for two years , bookings are generally easy and if you need to cancel or change a booking they are easy to speak to and courteous .
neutral	however if there are any_problems with the collection or delivery of the item that quickly changes with them perfectly capable of telling a pack of lies and quite prepared to become belligerent and rude .
neutral	also forget the sms text out for delivery service , its a waste of time and can end up doing more harm than good .
neutral	because once their uninformative sms is sent telling you that the delivery is out to you for the particular day , if there are any_problems for the driver , they do not send another telling you that the delivery will not be made , so you waste a whole day waiting , expecting a delivery that is never going to arrive .
neutral	satisfied with the product , although it states that you will not need to sharpen the lead – but it doesn_'_t self sharpen !
neutral	which means i need a pointer !
neutral	love the styling and extras you get with the pencil .
neutral	no_problems with online booking but why is it more_expensive then manchester_airport for the same length of time for parking ?
neutral	i was diisappointed that the first two black cartridges were not accepted by the epson wf0000 .
neutral	the other three colors worked but i had to buy a black in the retail market to make the printer work .
neutral	i had booked a car through a web_site ( order number 0000000 ).
neutral	despite the fact that , according to your information , prices on the website include the service at night , the company eurocar took an extra_cost of 00 euros .
neutral	i ask you to compensate for this cost .
neutral	in addition , i note that my order was satisfied at the second attempt : order number 0000000 you could not realize .
neutral	i waited for quite a while as other company vans ( spot , etc_.)
neutral	had multiple vans ( i counted at_least 0 per company and 0 for spot ) picking_up and dropping_off .
neutral	i called your company when i got to baggage_claim and no one picked_up .
neutral	so i texted the information .
neutral	i received the automated text reply so i know you received my information .
neutral	not sure if you need more vans , but that would be one thing to consider .
neutral	bathroom_suite good quality and good price .
neutral	what ruined it was the delivery as the young lad was rude and bad attitude .
neutral	sent back 0 brake_caliper core and a defective brake_caliper they sent me , they issue the credit for the core and not the defictive part they sent me , it was $_000 , i called several time and they will not answer , they will only relpy by email and each time they said i should have snt the parts in separate_boxes , bullshit , all parts were marked clearly , they robbed me $_000 .
neutral	refunds are my only issue with them , everything else is ok .
neutral	i ' d like bigger deposit limits
neutral	rented twice this summer .
neutral	both i had issues with .
neutral	however , the latest one in belgium was quite upsetting .
neutral	first , the lady informed me that the category i rented is not available so she must upgrade me .
neutral	she gave_me a huge station_wagon that i did not consider an upgrade ( there was a reason_why i rented a small category ).
neutral	so , i told her that i dont want that car .
neutral	i picked two smaller cars ; an audi_a0 and something else .
neutral	she wanted to charge me 00 euro extra a day so obvoiusly i did not take it .
neutral	then i picked another that she said i could take but then she replied that that car is dirty and it has t obe washed and it will be an_hour .
neutral	i picked another that she said is okay but she also said that that car is reserved .
neutral	i told her that i reserved a car too but you gave it away .
neutral	by then we picked a lesser category , volswagen up which was okay with her but she said that is a lesser category then what i paid for .
neutral	lets just say she pissed me off so i told her to just give me that car cause i dont care as long as it is small so i can get out of it .
neutral	flowers average for price paid , did not recieve chocs ( paid for ) delivery on time
neutral	they had a great selection of parts and an easy to navigate website .
neutral	i was even able to add an_additional item to my online order by phone .
neutral	however , when i didn_'_t receive my order the next_day , i was concerned .
neutral	i checked the status of my order online to find the order was pending .
neutral	i called the next_day to be informed that one of my items , the least_expensive item ($. 00 ) was out of stock and had to be sourced from another location .
neutral	so , instead of my order shipping on wednesday and arriving on thursday , the order did not ship until friday to arrive on monday .
neutral	no one called and the person i spoke to didn_'_t offer any consolation either ?
neutral	like free shipping , etc .
neutral	had i known this part was out of stock , or was going to delay the arrival_date , i would have not expedited my freight for an_additional $_00 . 00
neutral	seemingly good service , poor communication on their part .
neutral	would i order again ?
neutral	probably , but i would talk to someone one the phone before placing my order online .
neutral	for buying and selling on ebay , there is nothing better , but when you want to use those funds elsewhere , that '_s when you start to see the flaws .
neutral	if it were more widely accepted and didn_'_t take so long to transfer_funds to my bank_account , it would get 0_stars !
neutral	the initial reservation portion was great , the auto_europe website offered a lot of options and was very easy to navigate .
neutral	it allowed_me to reserve a car without paying , which is great and allowed_me to keep looking .
neutral	when i made the payment , auto_europe sent me the rental info , which was hertz , and a voucher which said i was paid in full .
neutral	then the not so nice .
neutral	when i picked_up the car , the bumped up the vehicle size ( compact to mid ) which i objected , but hertz indicated that that car was needed at my drop - off point .
neutral	the bigger car did drive nicer , but i wanted something that was small so i could feel_comfortable on the narrower city streets .
neutral	then when i dropped the vehicle off , hertz charged me a drop_off fee .
neutral	huh_?
neutral	i argued it that the vehicle was paid in full to no_avail .
neutral	the drop - off fee was not indicated on the auto_europe voucher or website .
neutral	wanted a simple rotary washing line cover and blow me but hombase do one for only £ 0 . 00 , full_length with zip & tie cord .
neutral	just what i want but then the ' kinks '.
neutral	kink 0 : ' click & collect ' not available but home delivery is ; at a cost nearly the same as the item .
neutral	call me a cynic but that smacks of a rip - off .
neutral	if it can be delivered to my home , why not to my local store ?
neutral	talked to the ' boss ' and she agreed " blow it , we '_ll get it anyway ".
neutral	now for ' kink 0 '.
neutral	went back into the web - site added one to my basket , then clicked ' checkout '.
neutral	nowt happened .
neutral	tried all_sorts including alternate browsers to no_avail .
neutral	two_days_later , tried again and finally succeeded .
neutral	last point .
neutral	i did e_-_mail their customer_support who proved useless as well as tardy .
neutral	i '_ve purchased a a lot of things from cjs previously but have never bothered to write a review so i figured i might as well add to the bunch of reviews .
neutral	the first purchase i ever made with them was for battlefield_0 limited_edition w_/ back to karkand , this was a pre_- ordered title that was promised to people far in advance so that users could pre_- load the game .
neutral	it didn_'_t turn out that way and it honestly put me back a little .
neutral	the price was cheap but not enough to where i had to wait to actually get a key ( although it stated " instant delivery ", which is almost never the case )
neutral	saint '_s row the third , this key took about 00_hours after purchasing to get it , i didn_'_t think much of it and i was busy with my own things at work so i didn_'_t mind much .
neutral	so again , listed as " instant delivery " but took 0 days to get .
neutral	third game i purchased from them was star_wars : the old_republic , this was a doosey as well , they said order the game and get a head start key_instantly , so i went to order the early access key which was listed at $ 0 . 00_usd which was a good deal considering people on ebay were charging upwards of $_00 + for just early access .
neutral	unfortunately , i ordered on the 00th of december , and received it on the 00th of december ( not much of a head start eh ).
neutral	so again , inconsistent , listing " instant delivery " with in stock but it really was not in stock at all .
neutral	and the most_recent_purchase is kingdoms of amalur : reckoning , now this states that there are keys in stock , with " instant delivery " but the game is not out yet .
neutral	they are basically deceiving people , which they should not be doing .
neutral	constructive_criticism :
neutral	if you want more customers , code your website a little better , i believe you guys need a completely new design that doesn_'_t make it look like your entering a scam website of sorts .
neutral	you guys make a good amount of money , hire a professional do something because what you have going on now is not good .
neutral	hire someone that will personally update keys and make_sure your stock system is accurate and put in some sort of notification system that says " pre_- order keys remaining " if you are sure you will be getting an x number of games from your supplier only sell that many games .
neutral	you never want to mislead customers into buying something they won_'_t get until days or weeks_later , it '_s just not how business is done .
neutral	you guys have been in business a long time and i hope you guys look at this review and improve .
neutral	i think everyone appreciates the deals they get but i believe they would pay even $ 0 more to not be deceived with things showing " in stock " that aren_'_t even out yet .
neutral	so ... tl_; dr , if you want something for sure at the time you want it , get it from a brick and mortar_store because buying it from any cd_key website ( not just cjs ) will not guarantee you getting it on time even if it '_s listed as " instant ".
neutral	reply to cjs :
neutral	thanks for the quick reply , it '_s good to see you guys are looking at this site and actually replying to customers .
neutral	you '_ve responded with some good points , but it '_s good to let customers know what '_s going on , you shouldn_'_t wait for each person to come to you to ask what '_s going on with their orders .
neutral	if you have supplier issues instantly update the page where the product is being sold , be pro - active about it send an e_-_mail out to all affected customers that this is the situation and this is what '_s being done about it .
neutral	i understand that kingdoms of amalur is a pre_- order title , but your system on the top of the page it does not state that .
neutral	just take a look at the picture , i '_m just saying you guys are not doing a good job at conveying that the item is a pre_- order item at the top of the page .
neutral	users have to look at the bottom , to see that .
neutral	it should state under " availability : pre_- order " that '_s all that would be necessary for any pre_- order game you guys sell .
neutral	just take a look at the picture , i want you guys to improve , not lose customers .
neutral	things like this picture i posted above , leave you with dis - satisfied customers and just uneasy feelings towards the company .
neutral	** picture in comment **
neutral	the web_site is easy to navigate .
neutral	but when i ordered the part the description said it was for my car '_s rear_window .
neutral	the part i received was too short and hoes to the bottom door .
neutral	your web_site did not list any dimensions but only said the part was for my year car .
neutral	i am a frequent customer of the site and i always get frustrated with the ordering_process .
neutral	there are many issues with your site and the orders simply do not flow smoothly .
neutral	just one example is how a model is available at ordering and then not available at the last step of check - out , leading to considerable wasted time .
neutral	that is not the only web related issue though .
neutral	your live help is well , helpless .
neutral	all she does is reiterate the obvious without presenting solutions or alternatives .
neutral	have problem with an order ?
neutral	well , call customer service .
neutral	this is not working ... well , call this number .
neutral	get_rid of it and save_money .
neutral	would i order from your company again ?
neutral	probably .
neutral	i may try an_alternative but you do deliver a good product for the right price .
neutral	you asked , i told you .
neutral	regards

neutral	the recent update to the iphone_app meant users became suddenly unable to see while offline any info about future reservations .
neutral	this caused a crisis for thousands of users in remote areas without free_wifi zones because without a printout or having written details down they could not see nor had evidence of how much money they needed to pay when they arrived as had been agreed during the reservation process .
neutral	this leaves you anxious about not having enough money when you arrive , particularly in places without atms .
neutral	also the new app demands you enter your password every time you turn it on , this is totally over the top .
neutral	finally , requests for reviews are not coming through automatically anymore .
neutral	please revert back to the old app .
neutral	item was as_described and in great condition , but i had an_email_saying it had been dispatched on a monday , only to find track it and ups didn_'_t pick it up from them until friday , delivering on the following_monday .
neutral	i emailed to ask about this on the thursday , but never got a response .
neutral	i ' d rate them 0_stars but they are becoming a monster and going against their own motto
neutral	i was sent a power_cord for a computer instead of the right power_cord .
neutral	it cost me $_00 to replace .
neutral	still have not received the money .
neutral	nice screen , though .
neutral	some classes in web programing package are very out of date .
neutral	one course is copyrighted 0000 and another is from like 0000 .
neutral	they talk about things like netscape and webtv that no_longer exsist .
neutral	i am_glad i did not pay full price for course package and would probably never buy another one from this company .
neutral	process was easy but communication from that end was poor .
neutral	in the end the passport arrived in time , they were speedy .
neutral	however , i had to call them each time ... and after several conversations they still failed to let_me know it had been shipped .
neutral	apparently , in the faq section they let you know that the us may charge you a bunch of import taxes that are due by check on delivery , but fail to do so in the more relevant ' shipping ' section .
neutral	free shipping means free shipping .
neutral	they ought to cover those taxes and don_'_t .
neutral	a bit bogus if you ask me , but the shoes i bought are flawless .
neutral	there should be a possibility of adding a delivery address next to the billing_address
neutral	was dear for what it was .
neutral	some headsets not working .
neutral	commentary was so so .
neutral	overall a bit disappointing
neutral	could be better .
neutral	not sure how to rate them because i am still_waiting for my book to arrive .
neutral	i ordered it last wednesday and it is a week_later and still no book .
neutral	supposed to arrive_tomorrow but i am not holding my breath .
neutral	i received my order on time was kept up to date along the way service was good .
neutral	my only_gripe is the carriage_charge it '_s way over the top and puts the price up to what you would pay at wickes etc
neutral	i just wish i can order lens only for my oakley_prescription_sunglasses , i had the sunglasses lens and i need extra lenses for replacement .
neutral	you have to good deal with your existing customers .
neutral	i m with you for a long time .
neutral	trying too many " tricks " these days
neutral	i received a call from the delivery company to schedule deliver 0 pieces of furniture this is after waiting the 0 to 0_weeks as_promised .
neutral	the night before delivery they called to say the couch was damaged and would be bringing the love seat & recliner ( not good news ) only .
neutral	the delivery was good and timely .
neutral	only problem the couch was not delivered they said it was damaged .
neutral	they said they would communicate with the company regarding the damage .
neutral	i called the company to find out what was happening with the replacement , only to find out it hasn_'_t been shipped .
neutral	the delivery men said a couple weeks and would come from a local warehouse , which i thought was strange , when it as actually a special order .
neutral	a very comvenient app that has all thr restaurants in town , while some drop_off of seamless .
neutral	the only_criticism i have of deep_blue was in trying to get through to enquire and purchase an item .
neutral	they have this automated_system which cuts in if the department you want is not answering - despite speaking to somebody and being redirected to sales ( who were busy in the shop ) i was cut_off several_times which did not impress .
neutral	on the positive side my persistence paid off and my enquiry and purchase were dealt_with promptly .
neutral	the staff come_across as friendly and helpful .
neutral	ordered right headlight , received left
neutral	let us hope that the one being shipped is not another left
neutral	ordered a rear lens_assembly .
neutral	when it arrived it had a small piece that had broken away floating loosely in the box .
neutral	the box that the assembly had been shipped in looked to be the original box from china with no packing insulation to prevent that sort of misfortune that befell the lens .
neutral	however , the part was a good match and , after an application of superglue , fit well on the vehicle .
neutral	i ordered a tail_light_assembly for my grand_cherokee .
neutral	the part came in two_days which was quite nice .
neutral	the only problems i have with it as soon as i took it out of the box i chipped a 0 " triangle off the lens .
neutral	when i installed it one of the bulbs blew immediately .
neutral	i would have sent it back but i needed a tail_light asap so i wouldn_'_t get harrassed by the popo .
neutral	0 days to get a pair of socks is to long .
neutral	i ' d tell my friends to buy the items he / they need from partsgeek unless he '_s in a hurry .
neutral	different_warehouses use different methods .
neutral	one box got here the next_day .
neutral	others
neutral	straggled in over the next 0 days .
neutral	good prices !
neutral	it took . few_days to come which was disappointing
neutral	parts came as stated from email for time of delivery .
neutral	i ordered two door_handles ; one interior , one exterior for same door .
neutral	( 0000_chevy prism ).
neutral	exterior handle went in with no_problems .
neutral	interior handle had some fitment issues .
neutral	i was not thrilled that the parts were combined in shipping but i was charged_twice for shipping .
neutral	it '_s not like these parts were overly large or heavy .
neutral	think box , packaging and parts weighted in at a whopping 0lb .
neutral	i order from blt quite often ( and will probably continue to do so ), but increasingly frustrated that some bulbs ( particularly led ) often arrive different to that specified .
neutral	for example " kosnic led classic shape 0 watt bayonet cap warm_white ( 00w alternative )".
neutral	website says 000 lumens , colour 0000k .
neutral	actual bulb says 000 lumens , colour 0000k .
neutral	tiresome to have to keep notifying customer_services and returning items .
neutral	i called tuesday to order my tires for thursday_morning to get put on and they didn_'_t order my tires .
neutral	.. so i had to pay for a more_expensive tire ... i didn_'_t like that to much .
neutral	the prices was good but delivery time was abit long and i ordereed three parts and two came by fedex and one by ups and ups was a day later and six hours bast the estimated delivery time .
neutral	the delivery experience and order process is generally very good on delivery . com .
neutral	however , i am very frustrated with the " promotions " process that never seems to work even if i click on the link in an_email after already logging in .
neutral	seamless uses promotion_codes which are much_easier than delivery . com '_s process .
neutral	consider switching over to promotion_codes if you want to give $ 0 off !
neutral	in two_weeks i will check back should have the pills by then ,
neutral	m . mullin
neutral	booked through a third_party website , called stress_free parking 00_mins before arriving at bristol_airport but they did not arrive until 00_minutes after we had parked at the express car_park !
neutral	also we were told that we could not park in the meet &_greet_parking places at bristol !
neutral	on return to bristol_airport we called 00_mins before as requested but we waited another 00_mins for our car to arrive !!!
neutral	we had a 0 year_old child with us and it was becoming cold .
neutral	when met by the person returning our car they did not ask for any id but just assumed the car was ours ( it was not the same person_who picked the car up ), this was a little worrying as potentially anyone could take any car they wanted !
neutral	one last point : if you have paid x amount to use a service why should you have to pay to leave the car_park , surely the company providing the service should give you a token to leave the car_park so you don_'_t have to pay more money ?
neutral	i '_ve used partsgeeks for five years and generally it '_s been a good experience .
neutral	the only boo boo was when they sent the wrong sized belt .
neutral	i didn_'_t bother to send it back because the shipping was more than the belt .
neutral	and someone please tell me why they will only ship certain items by air ?
neutral	the interaction as been good , except i '_m still_waiting for one of the parts .
neutral	i made my first order for my hp_ink_cartridges from inkfarm .
neutral	the cartridges were priced reasonable and the oem cartridges work great .
neutral	the only problem i had was how long it took to receive the order .
neutral	i believe it was close to two_weeks after i placed the order .
neutral	at first a tried ordering throw moneybookers ... i recieved an_email that i got the key , but i could not retrieve it .. and no money had been drawn from my card ... then i tried ordering throw paypal and it worked ..... thank_you so much .
neutral	i ordered a shifter tube for a ford pick - up .
neutral	it was reasonably_priced and i still do not regret it however a small portion of the casting was broken off - the little pin that hooks the gear indicator cable .
neutral	makes me wonder_how long before the whole thing snaps in half !
neutral	the panels turned_up in good order but the outer corner / end pieces were all broken , it was a good job that i didnt want the whole lenths in one piece as i would have had to send them back .
neutral	not very good i thought putting them in with out any packing to stop the cladding from crushing them .
neutral	just as well i managed to get by with a lot of fiddling and juggling around .
neutral	sorry but you did ask .
neutral	thank_you a jones .
neutral	good service overall , however disappointed i paid £ 0 . 00 for next_day delivery and the item arrives 0 days_later .
neutral	i email customer_services to query this , and i get a response 0 days_later , by which time my item has already been delivered .
neutral	however great product , and no other complaints .
neutral	the flowers were delivered on time and their customer service is good .
neutral	however , it is not that i didn_'_t like the flowers , it '_s just that they were not as in the picture on the website .
neutral	not bad , not good .
neutral	they have a huge_variety of products , the bad thing is that half of those are either useless or will brake in a month or so .
neutral	i think they should raise their quality standards in the things that they sale .
neutral	does not answer question in full , when emailed
neutral	they sent me the parts on time .
neutral	but they sent me a part that did not fit my 00 explorer .
neutral	i ordered two control_arms and only one was the correct type .
neutral	overall though good support from them .
neutral	the part got to me a day later than_expected considering i paid for 0day shipping this is all i have to complain_about and undamaged and fit like it was supposed too thanks to parts_geek and there low_prices

neutral	i ordered the rear oxygen_sensor for my altima .
neutral	the part condition was listed as " new " and the price was % 00 of what i would have paid at the local_auto_parts store .
neutral	also the part arrived withing a few_days in time for me to install on the weekend .
neutral	that all sounds great , however , the sensor was discolored by heat , and the cable was slightly yellowed , indicating to me that the part had been used before .
neutral	not being sure it was used , i went_ahead and installed it since i needed to get my car smog tested .
neutral	i examined my old part after removing and saw that my old part looked in the same condition as the one i just installed .
neutral	so , i believe that the part was used , however it seems to be working as the error code i now get says " converter inefficiency " instead of " oxygen_sensor ".
neutral	if i find out that the new code is being caused_by a bad sensor i will not be happy .
neutral	time will tell .
neutral	i am very impressed with the quality of the material and how the design turned_out .
neutral	however , there are a couple of issues however :
neutral	- i ordered a 0x which , according to the label , is what i received .
neutral	however , it is still too tight , more like a 0x .
neutral	- the zipper quality is not that great .
neutral	i fear the plastic zipper will not last long , especially_considering the tightness of the jersey .
neutral	it is also difficult to zip .
neutral	an upgrade to the zipper used ( perhaps to a more durable metal version ) might be advisable , even if it costs a little more .
neutral	took_longer_than_expected to receive the package . also the package arrived open .
neutral	kristina was a charming , fun , and engaging guide who compensated for tours that made false_promises and were overpriced .
neutral	pg had the lowest_price i could find on the web .
neutral	i had to pay sales_tax because the are located in nj where i live so why did i have to wait a week for the part to be shipped from ca ?
neutral	they still need an improvement on their water pipe cause it always hot and cold and hot and cold all the time .
neutral	i did a lot of research to find the best deal on quality tires in the area .
neutral	without a doubt town_fair_tire has the best deal .... if purchased through the internet .
neutral	i didn_'_t read the web_page that closely .
neutral	when i got the bill , i was surprised by the price .
neutral	the service was great , fast , no_issues at all .
neutral	just note , the internet price is lower_than what you '_ll get if you just go into a store .
neutral	i recently had concrete work done and was looking for a affordable company to do job .
neutral	networx helped find several contractors but unfortunately just one called me and that wasn_'_t till a week_later .
neutral	i was able to find someone on the yellow pages who did the job and also charged me an affordable price plus a very good job which showed me that if u really want a job_done u have to do some work yourself .
neutral	paypal allows very little leniency when it comes to doing_business via_paypal .
neutral	if you follow every rule to the letter you probably will not experience the true horrors of paypal .
neutral	if you do encounter any concerning issues paypal may or may not treat you like a valued_customer .
neutral	thankfully i haven_'_t had the same ridiculously terrible experience others have had with paypal , but i have lost money via_paypal in the past .
neutral	my experience with paypal has_been somewhat acceptable , but paypal_dispute has always been extremely stressful .
neutral	i have used steam since 0000 and thought it was such a great innovative idea .
neutral	unfortunately it was pretty buggy and clunky to use .
neutral	fast forward to 0000 and steam has really improved and many game publishers are hooking up with steam .
neutral	unfortunately customer service has left something to be desired .
neutral	i recently_purchased magicka from steampower , but unfortunately magicka '_s multiplayer seems to be completely broken .
neutral	to this day i cannot play a multiplayer game for longer_than a hour due to the ridiculous amount of bugs .
neutral	most multiplayer games end in seconds or minutes due to bugs .
neutral	steampowered '_s customer service refuses to offer any compensation for the broken game i have purchased .
neutral	no refunds , partial refunds , credits , etc .
neutral	just a straight up restatement of no refunds over and over .
neutral	i have also allowed reasonable time for the game developers to address the issue .
neutral	with poor customer service i cannot give anything higher_than 0 / 0_stars .
neutral	despite almost every e_-_mail_stating that other people in my post code have just ordered , i never seem to get the special deals .
neutral	you need some indication of likelihood - current system is just too open ended .
neutral	ships from warehouse a , b , c .
neutral	no guessing games .
neutral	say what city the warehouse is in or include a legend to reference .
neutral	just bought 0 sets of brake_shoes .
neutral	the description was " two ".
neutral	figured it was two shoes - a full set .
neutral	no , it was a full two_sets - for the entire axle .
neutral	poorly described .
neutral	i bought double what i needed .
neutral	a good deal , but a dumb ( me - or pg ) result .
neutral	managing your advertising and getting assistance via their various services is easy through their online system .
neutral	text_message updates are good too .
neutral	so their customer service is very good .
neutral	only problem for a landlord like me is that not many prospective tenants seem to be using rentify seriously .
neutral	high_street agents still seem to have far more people and working face to face they get them in the door for viewings whereas rentify enquiries tend to come to nothing .
neutral	this seems to be a big weakness in the model unfortunately so their service needs to include more proactive attracting of tenants .
neutral	i '_m worried the additions i paid for won_'_t show up on my new booking ... just make your you apply all your coupons before booking so you won_'_t have to be worried_about it
neutral	do not like having to go to a secondary party when i want to talk directly to the hotel i am looking to stay at .
neutral	the secondary party does not know what the the accomodation are like and cannot answer question_regarding a given hotel if they are not there at that location .
neutral	our stay was fine for the one night we needed .
neutral	i purchased the wrong part and automatically submitted a customer service ticket and they haven_'_t yet replied .
neutral	i wanted to return the wrong part and order the right one but i '_m strongly considering jjust making a full on return due to the bad customer service .
neutral	the heater xore i ordered for my 00 range_rover was xlose but not perfect for a $_000 .
neutral	it should have been spot on .
neutral	i had to cut the firewall a little to make the neck fit through the factory holes .
neutral	but it look like it is a quality part . hope it holds up for the years to come .
neutral	i ordered the creatine which is excellent however i was dissapointed having paid for the next_day deivery it was 0 days before i recieved the product .
neutral	shipping took over a week when most items ship in half the time .
neutral	i am_currently doing a full renovation of my home and came_across a shower that would fit perfect in my new master bathroom so i spent about an_hour on the phone with a representative figuring_out what was needed .
neutral	after_placing the order for the shower and sinf faucets i realized that the length of the faucets ordered were too_long for the sink going in .
neutral	i called first thing the next_morning and was on hold for 0 . 0 hours until someone answered the call .
neutral	i explained the situation and was told there would be no_issues cancelling the faucets and a refund to my credit_card would take place within 0 - 0 business days .
neutral	in addition for me to change any part of the order i would need to cancel the whole order and replace what is needed .
neutral	i asked for a cancellation number or proof of a refund which i was told they do not provide that .
neutral	it has now been about 0_weeks and i notified my bank and was told that they do not see a request for refund .
neutral	so now i am in the process of disputing charges which they have told me can take up to 00 days .
neutral	what a hassle over something so simple .
neutral	in addition , during the time of cancelling the order i was asked to be transferred to a sales_person so i can immediately reorder the shower .
neutral	during that process i was cut_off therefore having to call again and waited 00_minutes this time to speak with someone .
neutral	very disappointing .
neutral	the positive the shipment came quickly .
neutral	although i have personally not seen the shower yet , i am excited to see it installed .
neutral	my suggestion , fix the wait time while placing on hold and also fix your return_policy .
neutral	right now i currently have $ 0 , 000 that you are holding as a credit and also a $_000 purchase .
neutral	signing_up for the flight went well , but i didn_'_t get the seats i requested .
neutral	i think that was because i wanted " enhanced seating " because of my long legs .
neutral	for that i had to go to the airline web_site -- but that raises the question , why_bother with travelocity in the first place , instead of going direct to the carrier ?
neutral	it would improve your service a great deal if travelocity could also handle upgrades .
neutral	they got my name wrong -- it '_s " thiago " ( and that '_s how it appears on all originals ), but somehow on the translations my name was changed to " tiago ".
neutral	also , the originals contained multiple instances of " res .
neutral	", which is an abbreviation for " research ", and on the translations " res ."
neutral	sometimes got translated ( to " pes .
neutral	", which is an abbreviation of " pesquisa " - " research " in portuguese ) but sometimes not , which is really odd .
neutral	i also found the price a bit_steep - $_00 per 000 words , which in my case added up to over $_000 .
neutral	if it were bug - free i wouldn_'_t be complaining , but at that price i expected the work to be flawless ( which it wasn_'_t , unfortunately ).
neutral	on the plus side , i received both the quote and the translations pretty quick .
neutral	i recently bought a hoody at christmas and the metal toggle has already come loose !
neutral	we have not tried the x box yet but we were not happy with the delivery , the x box was left in our garden waste bin that due to the heavy_rain had water in it , the outer_box and part of the x box box were damp , i hope when my son opens this present on christmas day the game works !
neutral	my forks arrived in good time .
neutral	it '_s a shame they didn_'_t come in the original manufacturers box and with a shock pump as all the other rockshox forks i '_ve ever purchased have .
neutral	it '_s sounds_like a bit of a petty moan but it would influence my next purchase come the time .
neutral	keep me posted
neutral	the installer hardly spoke_english and did not communicate well .
neutral	no follow - up call to check on service or installation .
neutral	the company contacted me at_least 0 times to make_sure i was not canceling the initial appointment .
neutral	not sure if the system works .
neutral	already had police come out because the movement monitor was too sensitive .
neutral	not sure how long i will stay with service .
neutral	the email ship notice arrived after i received the part .
neutral	i was wondering when it would ship .
neutral	the quality of the bleeding kit was marginal .
neutral	i could not get the small plastic hoses to stay on the supplied fittings .
neutral	would have been easier if they were barbed
neutral	other than poor workmanship on attachment post i was satisfied .
neutral	do not know what i am getting or maybe doing
neutral	mittelmäßige erfahrung und unnötige kreditkartengebühren .
neutral	i specifically want a service where i can send a gift * anonymously * - hard to find .
neutral	great store and excelent selection on parts , but for some reason this part did not fit or apply to this car .
neutral	really nice sofa , love it .
neutral	just wish it had been quicker getting to me .
neutral	took 0_wks in the end ...
neutral	i am happy that i found a place that carries hard to find old_movies , but after i ordered they sent me an_email verifying my order , and told me i would receive free shipping .
neutral	later , after going over my bank_statement , i see that they charged me $ 0 . 00 for shipping when they distinctly told me it was free .
neutral	i had to call them to get them to credit my account .
neutral	i placed an order with myprotein . com , & they offered my free delivery if i placed an order over £_00 . 00 pounds , & i did but they didn_'_t give me free delivery , they charged me £ 0 . 00 , also they took far too_long to deliver .
neutral	it took almost a week for my items to come .
neutral	i '_m not too sure yet , if i will placed an order with myprotein . com again .
neutral	i have been a prime members since its introduction in 0000 and have been buying almost_exclusively on amazon and myhabit .
neutral	i never had a problem until amazon started_using usps .
neutral	out of many usps deliveries only one was delivered on time !
neutral	not only that - the postal service lies and claims that shipments were delivered a day or two before they actually are .
neutral	usps delivery people don_'_t bother making few steps to check whether you are at home and leave notice so that you have to go to the post_office to pick_up the shipment .
neutral	this makes prime a frustrating experience .
neutral	teaming up with the usps was a big mistake , and may end up costing amazon in a big way .
neutral	the quality of world of envelopes products seem to be first_class ,
neutral	however my last order was forgotten by the factory and nearly missed by art show .
neutral	in the end all was well and a special am delivery was made .
neutral	maybe next time a 0_star_review can be made
neutral	the entire experience was good the salesmen were the typical rush rush got to make a sale , and my daughter and i felt_like we were being patronized by sales people .
neutral	i ask a question and it appeared as if they were ignoring us .
neutral	then when confronting todd re : the electric jacks i thought we agreed on turned_out to be more b , s .
neutral	then prior to leaving todd told me that he needed to go on a bike_ride monday and he would bring out a drill for the jacks ( yah
neutral	right ) more salesman b , s ,
neutral	but , on a lighter side .
neutral	the schooling person and installer ( same person ) was great and very easy to get along with and from my experience would rate him a +++++++++++++.
neutral	now you have my review which i was ignoring on purpose .
neutral	so pls leave me alone .
neutral	thank_you great trailer ken fiege if honesty bothers you , i '_m sorry
neutral	i would recommend this site .
neutral	the pictures of the parts you are ordering was great and helpful .
neutral	the questions i had were answered in a timely_manner .
neutral	good job .
neutral	good comunication .
neutral	solve litle problems .
neutral	delivery are fast enough .
neutral	dont publish my reviews .
neutral	refuse to give cashback from quidco .
neutral	can improve .
neutral	this survey should not have been required until the order is complete and the customer is completly satisfied and could then give an accurate opion .
neutral	as i donlt receive part of my order until thursday and also the out of stock wasn ; t clear when orderining so i nw have to wait_until 00 april for the order to be complete .
neutral	the proof of the pudding is in dealing_with a claim so i cant rate it fully as yet .
neutral	it was easy enough to buy .
neutral	i ordered a new bosch_washing_machine ( as recommended by which ?)
neutral	- that was fine .
neutral	where things went a little astray , in my opinion , was when i found myself at the end of a conversation that , to all intents and purposes , made it sound like i had enquired and authorized an extended_warranty .
neutral	i hadn_'_t .
neutral	their phone system keeps fading in and out , so it is hard to hold a cohesive conversation .
neutral	i was in a hurry , so checked i had the ' opt out ' period and agreed to the darn thing just to get off the phone .
neutral	a week after_placing the order , i am still_awaiting any documentation v . v .
neutral	the warranty .
neutral	the delivery experience was second to none and i can '_t praise enough the updates over the phone and internet .
neutral	if you intend to ask ao to remove the old_appliance , be sure to ask them to disconnect it as well as remove it .
neutral	i requested they only remove the old machine .
neutral	this made me responsible for getting the old machine out so the new could be delivered / fitted .
neutral	fine .
neutral	but , both my son and i are well over 0 feet in height .
neutral	to move the old machine meant bending down a long way ( for us ) to lift a great weight .
neutral	because of this we took the machine outside and sat it on top of a workmate stand , i . e , we did not have to bend to put it down .
neutral	it is not made clear anywhere that i have looked that the delivery guys , for health & safety_reasons , can not lift anything above their waist level , so it has to be on the ground .
neutral	so be warned , what was very safe and very healthy for us wasn_'_t for them and they nearly refused to take it away .
neutral	they did , after all , but not without some discussion taking place .
neutral	would i recommend aop ?
neutral	very much so .
neutral	just watch out for the insurance hard sell and the h & s issue at home .
neutral	an important service to have , but i am a little disappointing some of their information is not updated - such as address , drivers lic , car registrations .
neutral	also almost every time i try to log on , i am taken to the marketing page as if i am a new customer .
neutral	wrong part received on 0 - 00 - 0000 contacted parts_geek twice no response today is 0 - 00 - 0000 !!!

neutral	john sutmire 000 - 000 - 0000
neutral	ordered product on saturday , was able to choose monday delivery which i thought was great , but let_down when it turned_up at our chosen local store late tuesday .
neutral	why let people to choose a day for delivery and they know they can '_t do it .
neutral	could not track parcel so had no_clue as to where it was , even the store could not find out .
neutral	they said it could be wednesday .
neutral	got it now that matters .
neutral	would like to have received more information .
neutral	i called the 000 # to add a day to my stay in , the guy said i was all set but when i got an_email it , he had canceled my orginal night not added on a night .
neutral	i then called the hotel_directly explained to the person answering what had happened , and the lady there said i was all set .
neutral	i then got a call when i was away from the hotel the next_day asking why my stuff was still in the room , they had went in to clean even_though i had put up the do not disturb sign .
neutral	it did get straightened_out but not happy with the all the confusion .
neutral	it seems that if the do not disturbed sign was up they would have taken an extra minute to see what the situation was before entering the room .
neutral	web_site was fairly easy to navigate and pricing was good .
neutral	after_placing order i was notified that order could not ship to different address than billing_address for security_reasons ( why no mention of this in the ordering info ?
neutral	), and i would receive a reply to my help ticket within 0 - 0 days ( why so long in this day and age ).
neutral	also , after_placing the order i was given terms & conditions ( if they were available before ordering , they were hidden pretty well ) that basically stated parts_geek wasn_'_t responsible for anything !
neutral	i did get everything as ordered , but not without some worry and irritation .
neutral	a little faster customer service ( maybe a phone #) would have made things a lot better .
neutral	i was pleased with the service .
neutral	will use again , but i hate all the pop_up advertisement at check out almost didn_'_t order , was confusing and it de - legitimizes the site .
neutral	good service , paid more for the items than was on the price tag .
neutral	a bit_annoying
neutral	feel_like they give lots of discounts but sometimes they fail you like when you order before delivery hours are done according to the site but you get a phone_call later saying that you wont be getting your food when its raining outside and you have nothing in your fridge
neutral	commande de 0 pneus neige un samedi , réception des pneus le vendredi suivant dans_l ' après - midi .
neutral	dimension courante 000 00 00
neutral	the first order was perfect .
neutral	the second one was not : the parts were not in stock and nothing tells you that when you go in the website .
neutral	paid fast shipping and came a week_later thanks i dont think that '_s fair
neutral	the delivery men although polite and left no mess , they failed to notice the two strips of wood protecting the bottoms of the upper unit sides .
neutral	screwing the unit together leaving them on left a 0 / 0 inch gap along the back between the top and base units .
neutral	a friend came and helped to lift the unit and remove the strips and we managed to refit it without causing any damage .
neutral	i was amused as i had paid £_00 to have the unit put_together and then had to re - do it myself .
neutral	as i am disabled and getting on in years it would have been nice to have had the job do correctly in the first place .

neutral	i need a return lable .
neutral	order pre_- xmas , but took until 0nd week of jan before delivery finally received .
neutral	had to tel and chase on 0 separate_occasions .
neutral	very pedantic on the scanned prescription not being acceptable because a small sliver not shown .
neutral	price competitive but too much hassle for just for cat medicine .
neutral	did ' nt have both medication tablets required either
neutral	overall , the facility was very good .
neutral	the managers were very nice as well .
neutral	during move in i had a strange experience with the tenant insurance .
neutral	on move in i was told by the on - site managers that purchasing their tenant insurance was mandatory .
neutral	after i got home and checked the contract more carefully , i didn_'_t see anywhere that said purchasing their insurance was mandatory .
neutral	so i went back in and the manager on - site ( a different one ), told me that it wasn_'_t mandatory and i could decline it .
neutral	otherwise the experience was great .
neutral	received the product .
neutral	not tried it yet .
neutral	der_er lidt over en uges venter tid men ellers er_det fint (:
neutral	everything arrivedfast , but how do you return a items ?
neutral	i thought your format for ordering was quite complicated .
neutral	slow response on order
neutral	acceptance .
neutral	i thought i ' d made a mistake and ended_up getting duplicate items .
neutral	i not only got burned for additional shipping_charges but also the charge for sending
neutral	it back .
neutral	and that sounded_like it was going to take awhile too .
neutral	i '_ve purchased many items on the internet but never witnessed so many problems .
neutral	i ' d probably use your company again but only if you ' re the only source with decent
neutral	prices .
neutral	i purchased a side_mirror and installed with new hardware mirror
neutral	was definetly not as tight as factory mirror , went over small
neutral	speed bump and mirror came out and hit ground and broke glass
neutral	tried to return filled_out return form , recieved e_-_mail_stating
neutral	since glass was broken could not return .
neutral	i still have mirror
neutral	with partial glass ordered new mirror , hopefully this one will
neutral	fit as tight as original or i will have to use original hardware
neutral	even_though that hardware has over 000 , 000_miles on it .
neutral	thanks
neutral	for listning dave puard
neutral	i '_m from brazil and i intend to continue buying if the product arrives .
neutral	however the product has not arrived yet .
neutral	i bought on 0 / 00 / 00 and so_far ( 00 / 00 / 00 ) did not .
neutral	but it is likely that the same problems here in brazil .
neutral	but the report that the site is trustworthy and even taking the product reach will_continue buying and recommending .
neutral	got the parts quickly , packaged well and in good condition , had a long wait in parts returned , do to me ordering the wrong parts , had a long wait on credit as well , but new parts were sent and arrived right_away .
neutral	great and unusual selection of products , but paying £ 0 . 00 for delivery which took 0 days from placing order isn_'_t acceptable in this day and age .
neutral	my first order was delivered on time , however i was a little_concerned_about the ' tight ' ' use by ' date .
neutral	given the fact that the offer was based_upon 00 steaks .
neutral	impressive array of quality electrical goods at very reasonable prices .
neutral	delivery was very quick once goods were in stock .
neutral	however , the good - looking , slick website is perhaps not 000_% up - to - date on stock_levels , as one item in my order delayed the whole shipment for a week , as it was apparently not in stock , despite what the website purported .
neutral	there was also no direct notification to me that the order was delayed - i had to go to the website to look up my order status .
neutral	otherwise would have been 0 or 0_stars .
neutral	my storage reservation was made , then i was transferred to pensky truck rental , where i was told about their rental one way to salem but would charge me for the trip back to portland where my car would be , so it was no use to me .
neutral	much of the stuff in the clothing line is out of stock ........ especially the xl sizes in men '_s " big & tall ".
neutral	should rename it " pigmies @ m & s "
neutral	i had to set_up a new account because the website would not acknowledge password or new password .
neutral	once an order is placed , it is very difficult to figure_out what dvds are being sent and which are not available .
neutral	refund e_-_mails show up without revealing what dvds are not available or unavailable .
neutral	one of the worst customer friendly websites .
neutral	amazon is always preferable .
neutral	the hotel and flight were good prices but we did not get the $_000 food credit as_promised .... so the deal wasn_'_t that great !
neutral	i don_'_t believe that i should pay for shipping to return an item when you get the order wrong .
neutral	next time i will spend a few extra dollars and have the car back on the road in a day instead of 0 days .
neutral	i think the older version worked better for our office because it was always working in the background .
neutral	unseen and flawless .
neutral	the newer_version seems to want to protect you more , but pops_up here and there in the middle of work and just becomes plain irritating .
neutral	it is also a bigger file and have still had issues installing it on older computers .
neutral	i believe avg free would work just as well and there is a free version .
neutral	ordered a part for my jeep ( upper idler_pulley ) and it specifically stated on the website upper idler_pulley .
neutral	part shows up ....... lower idler_pulley in the box .
neutral	i had to go to o ' reileys auto_parts for the right part ($_00 . 00 ) so i used the one shipped and changed the lower one as well .
neutral	mode d ' emploi trop succin et amélioration à faire sur_les garanties ( pas_de garantie sur_les batteries rechargeables ). tres content des délais d ' envoi et du fonctionnement de l ' appareil
neutral	the product was fine , but they would not answer the phones at any extension and would not answer emails and would limit inquiries .
neutral	did not ship overnight as i paid for .
neutral	it was easy to order the glasses .
neutral	the cheap ones , like mine , are made in china .
neutral	the site explained that there would be a long delay in the delivery because they are posted from china .
neutral	the secs arrived at the end of the stated delivery time .
neutral	so do not expect a rapid service .
neutral	the glasses when they arrived appeared to me to be the correct prescription as i see ok with them .
neutral	however , the legs were so tight i thought i might break them trying to open them .
neutral	now they are quite loose as if there has_been heavy wear in the hinge .
neutral	i doubt that i will get years of use from these glasses .
neutral	they are very cheap but may not be value for money .
neutral	you should make it clearer that there is a requirement to pay a booking_fee on top of the prices you quote !
neutral	oxford dictionary defines friction as a " conflict or disagreement ".
neutral	interesting that i '_m asked to review a product that i '_ve used exclusively since june_0000 , however a lapse of account usage for five months and my customer status was relegated to " newbie " ( and this imposed a daily spending_limit of $_00 ).
neutral	a conflict of customer loyalty then , considering i wasn_'_t able to purchase multiple items as they were needed .
neutral	factor in the additional friction of telephone verification before my order could be completed , and you ' re left with [ my 0 - star recommendation ] - subsequently downgraded after a very stressful experience on july_0th , 0000 .
neutral	the nightmare began after_placing my order for two [ 0 ] playstation_network_cards for hong_kong - each valued at 00 . 00_usd .
neutral	when i opened my email account and saw there were eight [ 0 ] " approving order " notifications , i should '_ve twigged that something wasn_'_t right .
neutral	my worst fears were confirmed only after taking delivery of my order , and therein discovering that a number of surplus redemption cards had been delivered ( some 00 in fact , when i ' d only authorized two ).
neutral	i immediately contacted pc_gamesupply and asked them to review and / or remove those items so that i wouldn_'_t be charged for them .
neutral	fast forward to my bank_statement of july_0th , and i now find - as feared - that i was in fact charged for sixteen playstation_network_cards [ each valued at 00 . 00_usd ], thus creating a deficit in my credit rating .
neutral	after providing a screenshot of said statement for the purposes of a refund , pc_gamesupply did in fact acknowledge there was a " problem with their payment_processor ", but it took the best part of six [ 0 ] business days before credit was restored to me .
neutral	i guess my experience should serve as fair warning to others ... if you see something that doesn_'_t look right in your email_notifications , please ask the vendor to review the order for you before taking delivery .
neutral	after all , there is a disclaimer that once you '_ve " viewed your order " you ' re not entitled to a refund .
neutral	my experience could '_ve ended very badly for me , but to its credit , pc_gamesupply turned things around .
neutral	i '_ve downgraded my rating for this seller , and that '_s incidental to the fact that they supplied two [ 0 ] non_- working playstation_network_cards [ for netherlands ] in a subsequent transaction .
neutral	an " acceptable " experience ?
neutral	hardly .
neutral	took a week to arrive
neutral	i placed my order may 0th , i received conformation of the order .
neutral	i have not heard back since , on when the order was shipping .
neutral	i would like to be kept_informed as to when i should expect my order .
neutral	on the conformation , an expected shipping date would be nice , and then a notice when order was shipped .
neutral	i made a purchase and forgot to select auto shipment so i contacted customer service so i could get the 00 . 00 first customer discount .
neutral	she told me that i would have to wait_until my next reorder .
neutral	several days_later i decided to place a reorder but went an changed the product this removed the discount .
neutral	i attempted to contact pets via_telephone but they are closed on saturday .
neutral	i decided to go back and use <_external link_removed_> as they have better customer service and don_'_t make
neutral	the buying experience this difficult .
neutral	i purchased a new gas_cap for my suv .
neutral	it fit_properly , but i was disappointed it did not have a tether .
neutral	i order a muffler and resonator pipe for a 0000_ford escort they should have connected together but where the muffler should have fitted over the resonator pipe they where the same sized and would not connect together until i went out and bought an adapter in which i should not have needed had to cut down the resonator pipe ( limited space ) and waste a 0 / 0 a day .
neutral	yes double_checked the part numbers with walker and the where correct .
neutral	i can '_t write you a proper review until i have unpacked and hung my curtains which will not be until august - in crete !
neutral	sorry .
neutral	this is probably a bad time for me to do a review as both of the items i received recently had problems .
neutral	first , a lower engine_cover for a vw was advertised for the wrong year and the part itself was so thin and cheap i wouldn_'_t want it my car to start with .
neutral	to top it off it was shipped to me rolled up like a poster and to no surprise it was cracked in multiple places .
neutral	second , i ordered a blower resistor w_/ atc for a chrysler and the china made unit worked great for about a day and then failed .
neutral	i probably_won_'_t buy electronic modules here in the future .
neutral	in fairness , however , mechanical items i received in the past , struts , belts , etc .
neutral	were fine and of good relative value compared to the oem counterpart .
neutral	trueshopping lithium powered cordless long reach hedge trimmer 00v photo does not include the battery_charger .
neutral	the charger is pictured as an essential extras .
neutral	so i got both and now have two chargers .
neutral	i wanted two batteries but could not get a battery on its own .
neutral	i was nervous up till delivery , your telephone system is not professional , the staff was professional , but the phone prompts were not .
neutral	we were not certain , until the furniture actually arrived , if we were or were not dealing_with a real company .
neutral	now that we have the furniture , we are pleased with the result .
neutral	you really need to consider to improve upon your telephone prompts to improve your image .
neutral	my contact_lenses took a full week to arrive , which isn_'_t surprising considering they were sent from an international address .
neutral	the lenses themselves though were in perfect_condition and at a price that i cannot_complain_about .
neutral	upon waiting for the part service was extremely fast thank_you for fast delivery ... with the exception when the part was received we were able to install the part but part was defective ... just wish that the return procedures were just as speedy .... as of the moment still_waiting upon response from company & refund
neutral	same as above
neutral	when we first put the ink in one of the cartridges leaked all over my husbands hands .
neutral	the first few prints were a little_bit streaky .
neutral	we just had to clean the heads and then everything worked great .
neutral	i ordered a quilted barbour_jacket from country_attire as they were the only company i could find who had my size in stock .
neutral	i am very pleased with the jacket & the price i paid .
neutral	i don_'_t know if they use dpd exclusively but that '_s who delivered the jacket .
neutral	i received a txt from dpd informing_me the jacket would be delivered between_0am & 0pm ( what '_s the point )?
neutral	so stopped in all day , at 0000 i received a further txt saying it ' d be here by 0pm but 0pm came & went so i checked online & it ' d been returned to the depot at 0000 due to adverse_weather_conditions .
neutral	the postman got to my house that day as did a hermes courier ( not that i recommend them - unless you want your parcel putting in the green bin & your signature forged ).
neutral	next_morning i got a txt to say it would be delivered between_0am & 0pm that day ( deja vu ).
neutral	to be fair it arrived at around_0pm but why txt to say it '_s coming but email when it '_s not .
neutral	having ordered this same jacket in a smaller_size from a different company & paying to return it myself with royal_mail how much_cheaper_than £ 0 . 00 are dpd doing ( or not doing , actually ) it for you ?
neutral	it '_s a fantastic product , at a great price let_down by the courier you choose .
neutral	if i had my time again & the opportunity to do so , i ' d pay extra for royal_mail to deliver if you miss the driver ( which is less likely ) you can go get it yourself without having to drive to some backwater trading estate in the middle of nowhere .
neutral	i wasn_'_t in a rush for the jacket but i don_'_t want to stop in all day for it not to come while being misinformed by the courier .
neutral	0_stars when you should have 0 all because of dpd .
neutral	the choice of courier usually affects my choice of retailer but country_attire was the only place i could get the product in the required size .
neutral	goede service , maar te hoge prijs m . n .
neutral	als_je na bij_het afrekenen ook_nog de bezorgkosten extra moet betalen .
neutral	i '_ve always liked ordering from parts_geek .
neutral	the prices are great and orders easy using the website .
neutral	my problem is that exchanging my old parts ( core ) for a refund requires filling_out a customer service form , several emails , and several days to get an_rma_number .
neutral	the process should be greatly simplified .
neutral	the return_authorization_number should be created automatically with the original order ( for those with a core_return ) and sent with the order or shipment .
neutral	it should not take several extra steps by a customer .
neutral	great returns process and good range , but sent us the wrong_size in 0 out of 0 pairs of shoes we ordered , which was a bit of a hassle .
neutral	the pump ( with electronics ) was in the original flimsy cardboard_box and then put in a plastic_bag for despatch ..
neutral	at various_stages of transport , the carrier obviously just grabbed the bag to move / shove / pile up the item so that the cardboard_box was dented and bashed .
neutral	this is not the fault of the carrier but of anchor_pumps packing department .
neutral	i am not able to determine if the pump has suffered damage until it is fitted ( won_'_t be till end may ).
neutral	as a minimum , there should be some layers of bubble_wrap to cushion and protect the pump with the electronics during_transit .
neutral	cheap and fast ; they sure are .
neutral	however they cant help me in the sales process ; just undercut everyone_else who can
neutral	i was very satisfied with all_aspects of the booking site except for the deceptive practice of showing the room price as one set amount .
neutral	it appeared this price included tax and fees and the competitors price below was the same but did not include taxes and fees .
neutral	a reputable firm should not have to try to decieve its ' customers .
neutral	parts are cheaper_than other_companies even with the shipping .
neutral	but if you have a small piece missing , like two 00 * grease_fittings .
neutral	just buy at your local_auto store .
neutral	the customer service is bad on emails , they have my phone_number also and i need my car asap ..
neutral	i myself will check for a better site , for better service .
neutral	otherwise shipping was quick
neutral	the website is great and the product range , the same .
neutral	every time i order something though ; i get a notification telling_me it is currently out of stock !
neutral	why sell it , if you haven_'_t got it in stock , ( ok we all know why ) but it wears on the patience a little .
neutral	i still use the site , but have also suffered wrong or missing items .
neutral	customer_services have always been obliging but with long delays and missing items you need to have the patience of a saint .
neutral	delivery . com is ok .
neutral	i enjoy working with n0wireless but when it comes to the product itself .
neutral	most of the items were not what they were described .
neutral	for example , many of my customers returned their ipad with verizon because there were still open accounts on them .
neutral	customer were not able to open their account until the original was closed .
neutral	also , the website is never updated as far as stock .
neutral	several_times i was told after the order was placed the item was not available .
neutral	left me in the position to either reimburse customer or seek another source .
neutral	i will stay with n0wireless because the customer_support is great and i hope these concerns will improve .
neutral	your rate per min .
neutral	to the country where i always call is very expensive .
neutral	if you could reduce the charge a bit i '_ll literary work to get more costomers for you .
neutral	when i ordered a part that was free shipping i thought since i was getting free shipping ii would order some other things that i could use on my other vehicle .
neutral	i found out when i was checking out that there was a shipping charge on the other things that i added to my order .
neutral	one item was shipping from a different warehouse and three items were at yet another warehouse .
neutral	i was charged about $ 0 . 00 from each of the other warehouses .
neutral	i received the two boxes from those warehouses but haven_'_t received the free shipping item yet .
neutral	b_&_h has the best selection and generally a very knowledgeable_staff , but man do they have terrible customer service and commerce issues .
neutral	i get b_&_h gift_certificates every year for christmas , and every time i go to use them in - store , the cards are vetted by a manager with the scrutiny of someone examining a $ 0 , 000 bill .
neutral	they ' re your gift_cards , b_&_h , why don_'_t you trust them ?
neutral	i '_ve also just completed a purchase online in which i attempted to apply the balance of a rewards card .
neutral	the balance of the rewards card isn_'_t deducted from the total , and when i chatted with customer service to find out why this wasn_'_t working , i was told that reward card balances aren_'_t deducted from the total , but that i wouldn_'_t be charged the full_amount .
neutral	so i '_m suppose to just trust that i '_m not being billed the full_amount ?
neutral	learn about online shopping , b_&_h !
neutral	smooth , effortless transactions are the reason people shop online .
neutral	get with it .
neutral	called the booking service and they refused to resolve the issue .
neutral	no refund or discount .
neutral	an extra day free would have been nice .
neutral	i had trouble determining if a particular event was available through goldstar , and i couldn_'_t find an easy access " search " feature .
neutral	good glasses for the price but dissatisfied with the long wait to receive them .
neutral	prices were good , shipping was fast , but lack of being_able to cancel an order was a waste of money .
neutral	how my transaction went - i ordered one item and immediately realized i needed additional items , so i made another order with the same original item plus others , thinking i ' d cancel the first order immediately following .
neutral	i soon found out that there is no customer service dept .
neutral	to call and make a cancellation nor do they accept cancellations .
neutral	so not only do i have a duplicate item , i paid shipping twice .
neutral	if i want to rturn the item i '_ll have to pay shipping again and it will end up costing more than the item itself .
neutral	my girlfriend called me on tuesday that the flowers were already fading
neutral	the part had a problem and had to be modified .
neutral	the nylon ball was not mounted properly on the shift assembly and came off , the mechanic had to use the one off the broken assembly .
neutral	i purchase the wc0000rtm - k00 pool_cover 00 ' x 00 ' rt mesh cover
neutral	with 00 of the 00 foot water tubes .
neutral	the cover was as_described however the water tubes were defective - especially the cover for the inlet water - the covers that did not seal properly .
neutral	several of the water tubes leaked when filled which i repaired instead of returning .
neutral	i didn_'_t receive my order yet , still_waiting ...
neutral	les commandes sont préparées très_rapidement , pour moi c ' est le point fort de miniplanes .
neutral	les_prix sont correct , et en_cas de non commande ( après un ajout au panier ) quand on reçoit le mail qui nous demande pourquoi on a pas commandé , si on " link " un site concurrent avec la même référence moins_cher , miniplanes met a jour ses prix .
neutral	par_contre , la gestion des stock est calamiteuse .
neutral	il m ' est arrivé plus d ' une fois de commander un objet " en stock " qui en fait ne l ' était pas .
neutral	et_la on voit que_le sav est mauvais .
neutral	personne ne nous contacte .
neutral	on voit que_la_commande de bouge pas , au_bout de plusieurs jours , on appelle , et_la on nous dit que l ' objet est hors stock et qu ' il_faut x semaines pour_l ' avoir .... la le sav nous propose un avoir sur l ' objet .
neutral	si on accepte il_faut encore appeler 0 ou 0 fois pour que l ' avoir soit réellement crédité sur_le compte .... incroyable !!
neutral	!
neutral	il m ' est arrivé plusieurs fois de poser des questions sur un article , dont la description me paraissait erronée , au vue de_la référence constructeur ( par exemple le mah d ' une batterie ).
neutral	directement , le sav ne cherche pas a comprendre , ils confirment que_la description est bonne .
neutral	il_faut attendre plusieurs semaines pour qu ' ils daignent vérifier , et qu ' ils envoient un mail en disant qu ' en fait il se sont trompé .
neutral	miniplanes a perdu plusieurs fois une occasion de vendre avec cette pratique ( en tout cas a moi )
neutral	pour_l ' anecdote , une fois dans_un kit d ' un bateau , commandé sur miniplanes , il manquait une pièce .
neutral	je téléphone au sav .
neutral	on me dit " il_faut voir avec le constructeur , parce que nous on n ' ouvre pas les boites , donc c ' est_pas notre faute ".
neutral	je demande alors a l ' interlocuteur , comment il font pour mettre une publicité miniplanes dans_la boite du kit sans l ' ouvrir .
neutral	on m ' a raccroché au nez ... professionnalisme !!!
neutral	moralité , après de nombreuse tentatives , je_n ' ai jamais eu ma pièce , le constructeur chargeant la boutique , et_la boutique le constructeur .
neutral	bref avec miniplanes , quand tout va bien , c ' est_bien , mais si il_y a un grain de sable , c ' est la mouise assurée ...
neutral	i ordered an ac_compressor and valve for my bmw 000il .
neutral	when it came time to check out , i clicked on overnight shipping because that has_become my daily driver and i really needs working ac before i made a 000 mile trip that weekend .
neutral	the valve did show up in a couple days but the compressor took over a week to show up .
neutral	when i called customer service to ask why i still hadn_'_t got a tracking_number on the compressor 0 days after the order was placed , they got a snotty attitude and said " well it was obvious when you ordered you were only paying overnight shipping on the valve .
neutral	if it was obvious , i ' d have never paid_extra for a part that did me no good till the other part arrived .
neutral	just be aware that when you click on overnight shipping , it is not for the whole order .
neutral	i got the shocks i ordered which work well but i ordered it 0 day shipping and they were sent regular_ground mail .
neutral	other than that great price and great service .
neutral	still_waiting on refund for shipping cost .
neutral	the tail_light was broken when it arrived in the mail .
neutral	however , i was on vacation when the product arrived and per the company policy no damaged products will be accepted after 00_hours .
neutral	the product still works , but was disappointed in the packaging of the product .
neutral	the rooms smelled_like horrid bo .
neutral	once you got over the smell the rooms were ok .
neutral	the beds were comfortable and the best part of the hotel .
neutral	price was great considering the location .
neutral	the breakfast want bad .
neutral	overall , i give it 0_stars .
neutral	the staff was friendly as well which is a plus .
neutral	need some money to fix an_unexpected brake down of my vehicle .
neutral	from apply apply at 0am approval was granted before_lunch .
neutral	missed fitting on a saturday as tyres were delivered to wrong fitter !
neutral	fitted 0 days_later , apart_from this service was good .
neutral	i recently spent $_000_dollars with your services .
neutral	however , i '_m not sure if my meds were old or expired .
neutral	they did nothing for me as they have in the past .
neutral	very disappointed .
neutral	not sure if i will make another order with your company or not .
neutral	i have been ordering through your website for a few_years and have never had a problem before .
neutral	until now .
neutral	regards ,
neutral	jeff havlik
neutral	our first representative was a charismatic person .
neutral	but unfortunately we had to go back the second day and he was no_longer able to assist us .
neutral	so one of the manager was there to assist the next_day , she wasn_'_t that charismatic , you could tell that she just want us in and out .
neutral	they had us talk to different representatives and moving us to different work station .
neutral	we had greatly expressed that we were buying a car due to our son health condition and that we need a reliable car .
neutral	our car ended_up breaking , around the third week we had gotten it .
neutral	( the day of my son surgery ).
neutral	when we call to see what we had to due .
neutral	they quickly told us that they don_'_t handle mechanical work and that we had to call some number .
neutral	so that being said not that great customer service .
neutral	the rental was supposed to be all_inclusive , insurance included .
neutral	when i went to rental office they told me insurance was not included to take it up with auto_europe had to pay extra insurance to get the vehicle .
neutral	avis people were very good .
neutral	our order arrived as_promised and the quality of the curtains were as we expected .
neutral	good quality .
neutral	unfortunately the rod system was useless .
neutral	the system initially held the curtains but after 00_minutes the adhesive gave way and everything ended_up on the window ledge .
neutral	i eventually gave up and purchased another system from a local retailer which works_fine .
neutral	alpha_brain was ok , but not sure if i experienced actual results or just a very mild placebo_effect .
neutral	i won_'_t order again until onnit goes back to the original formula .
neutral	my business need is a shared diary for colleagues in 0 different timezones .
neutral	during my evaluation i found many excellent features but the support for timezones is imho rather weak and certainly not good enough for serious use .
neutral	there is an over - reliance on the concept of " base time " which is not really meaningful when your workers are spread between california and greece .
neutral	certainly my colleagues in california do not want to view their shared tasks in a display which is calibrated on a " base time " 0 hours different from their local time .
neutral	finally got the delivery , but due to an incorrect postal order no .
neutral	i had trouble tracking it down .
neutral	i ended_up paying shipping twice because the internet description of the parts i needed was vague .
neutral	further the second part had no picture , and has not yet arrived so i am still not sure i can repair my car .
neutral	i have been on sites which have schematics with part #'_s which are far easier to order from .
neutral	i found that the back of the brush started to catch my lips and made them sore to the point of bleeding until after a week '_s usage when they have seemed to settle down , of course i have only tried one brush so it could be a fault in making on all the brushes or just a one off .
neutral	to be asked to review a review can be annoying to say the least ..
neutral	i appreciate that you like data but repeating yourself can be tedious to say the least ...
neutral	heinnie '_s product portfolio is excellent , communication is fast and their website is clear and appealling .
neutral	after ordering more than ten times from heinnie it is easy to predict when a shipment wil arrive .
neutral	i also had nothing to worry or complain_about earlier .
neutral	i live_abroad , as such i do not expect packages to arrive as fast as within the uk .
neutral	i also checked the website from royal_mail for delivery times abroad .
neutral	on average it takes a week to receive any package .
neutral	however , the last months delivery times seem to take longer ... the last one even a month .
neutral	i consider myself a s regular client , as such , i am getting more and more worried_about sloppy delivery times .
neutral	a small package should not take four weeks to be delivered anywhere in the eu ...
neutral	i am willing to order more products , but at this stage i am reluctant to order again after delivery times which are far from reasonable .
neutral	i noticed a serious decline in the delivery service , which i really regret .
neutral	i placed my order on 0 / 0 0000 they had some questions that i didn_'_t know about till i contacted them .
neutral	once i did they replied in a fast timely_manner .
neutral	with in minutes .
neutral	it is now february 00 and still have not received my freight
neutral	i received my tracking_info and tracked the part to my front_door .
neutral	when i opened the box it was partial_shipment .
neutral	i was not informed that the remaining parts were coming since i only had 0 tracking_number .
neutral	they arrived the next business day .
neutral	i have ordered parts several_times before and this has never happened so i '_m chalking it up to an_anomaly .
neutral	cheapest around but takes too_long to process order
neutral	not having not tried the red tube sandalwood proraso , and having used the traditional green tube cream for years , i thought i ' d give the red tube a try .
neutral	order comes , invoice says sandalwood , yep , that '_s the green tube in the box !
neutral	figured it was too much of a pain to return it , so sticking with the green tube for now ...
neutral	the low stars are for the mix_up , proraso still the best shaving_cream , bar_none ..
neutral	i called the 000 # to get a return_authorization # after waiting more than 00_hours for them to respond to my online request for one per their protocol .
neutral	i wanted to return a core for reimbursement to my cc today as i '_m not working .
neutral	i got voice recording saying high_volume of calls and waited for over half_hour .
neutral	i '_m a little disappointed that i have no other avenue to get an_rma from them till they ' re ready to send me one via_email .
neutral	i hope i eventually get one and that my core reimbursement happens in a timely_manner .
neutral	online ordering went fine .
neutral	had to look at photography book to get name of items needed could not locate them going thru items posted on pages , even with the many icons are descriptions given could not find items i wanted . had to get magazine out and type in items to locate them , usually at sites i visit click on icon are name think item is in and locate it olot easier than your site , so_far at_least .
neutral	lec freezer compartment lid .
neutral	the service is fine ; finding the right part is straightforward .
neutral	the part itself , however , is expensive and of very poor quality ; it breaks in a short time , we '_ve used 0 with this freezer !
neutral	received parts i ordered and on time .
neutral	i could never get an associate to answer the phone .
neutral	i guess my mechanic will have to verify the parts are correct for my toyota
neutral	i had accidentally put the wrong zip in my order ( my fault ).
neutral	when i told that to customer service , they said that they can '_t change it , so i ordered another part with the correct zip .
neutral	the post_office said it will probably go back to them because of incorrect zip .
neutral	a few_days_later , i received 0 parts .
neutral	both had the correct zip .
neutral	someone on their end changed it and they didn_'_t tell me so i paid for shipping on 0 parts .
neutral	they only refunded me for the part .
neutral	it just left a sour_taste in my mouth .
neutral	it took two_days to fill and ship my order .
neutral	when it finally arrived seven_days_later the package was left at my door and the box was open .
neutral	i could not voice my displeasure to the driver or refuse delivery sense know one knew when the driver come by to deliver our merchandise ..
neutral	i placed an order for two parts that stated they were in stock .
neutral	i waited three_days with no email regarded the status of my order at which time i checked online to find that the order was canceled .
neutral	there was no email or call to tell me .
neutral	i eventually received an_email 0 - 0 after tell me that the parts were out of stock .
neutral	very frustrating .
neutral	would no recommend this site .
neutral	they need to improve their communication .
neutral	easy ordering , good delivery , but in between far to many texts , voice_messages ( i lost_count ) re delivery and trying to sell extra cover , it really spoilt the whole_transaction .
neutral	always happy with the kit and the service and have returned more than once for more stuff , however , if you ' re not in a rush for your order , there '_s no slower / cheaper despatch option than £_00 next_day service .
neutral	on top of that vat is applied to the postage at checkout so it '_s even more than £_00 minimum option .
neutral	please address the checkout / postage options
neutral	despite phoning up initially and asking for help , our original order was not fit for purpose .
neutral	after afew more conversations we now have something that has done the trick .
neutral	ytdfyfglgh ; oi
neutral	when i order parts , i expect for all of them to come at the same time .
neutral	if you are going to be sending a partial_shipment because you don ; t have all of the parts in stock
neutral	i would like to know so that i won_'_t be guessing as to when the other parts are going to arrive .
neutral	i received 0 of the three items on wednesday and was told when i inquired that the other part , a cabin_air_filter , was being shipped from another location and would arrive later that day or the the next business day .
neutral	today is friday and still no part .
neutral	items are as_described but they are drop shipping company .
neutral	they sent me a tpms monitor instead of pcv_valve .
neutral	i wanted to return it but i have to pay for return shipping even if its they ' re fault
neutral	all the different items were shipped at different times even if i intentionally picked warehouse a
neutral	i will still stick with my reliable amazon store .
neutral	great to work with and fast
neutral	i received my parts in good condition and in a timely_manner .
neutral	i would have ordered more , but the three_times i sent emails all i received were auto - replies .
neutral	every time i called , i was disconnected .
neutral	the prices are good , but if anything goes_wrong , i don_'_t think it could be resolved quickly or at all .
neutral	when i received my shipment , i sent an_email to inform them about an issue with my order .
neutral	i still_haven_'_t received a reply .
neutral	online parts ordering ws not clear for the part i needed .
neutral	i called and gave the associate my vehicle information and they told me the part i needed .
neutral	when the part arrived , it was the wrong part .
neutral	i called back , talked to zac .
neutral	told_him i talked to volkswagen and they gave_me the part number i needed .
neutral	he asked for the vin_number i gave it to him and he confirmed i had been sent the wrong part .
neutral	he sent the new part and a return shipping_label .
neutral	the part arrived in good condition and is now on the car .
neutral	the wrong part was returned and i have been credited .
neutral	there was over a week delay that should not have happened .
neutral	ordered flowers on a sunday .
neutral	the credit_card was rejected for no reason .
neutral	flora_queen didn_'_t even check with the credit_card company .
neutral	this resulted_in a delay by one day .
neutral	handling by the local store was however outstanding as they managed do deliver on time despite the fact that the recipient was in a temporary off limit zone due to an international summit .
neutral	very satisfied with the product selected .
neutral	very easy site to pick from .
neutral	but was disappointed because i could not get a piece of tape for mounting .
neutral	an easy fix for less_than . 00_cents - poor customer service satisfaction .
neutral	yikes !
neutral	real shame no nitrogen filling like the centres i might rethink in future but otherwise abolsolutely great
neutral	you can buy just about 00_% of stuff that is made in china from here .
neutral	the existence of this company is to be the middleman for alibaba . com their purpose is to sell smaller quantity than alibaba .
neutral	i do recommend this , however consumer must be extremely careful when making a purchase .
neutral	contact the seller and see if they have a dedicated customer service , check how fast the respond to your question , if it '_s over 0 days to respond , don_'_t deal with them , check their history and check their feed_back that have actual comments from buyer .
neutral	other than that , if you spend the time to research , you can actually find some great deals for resale .
neutral	the door_handle i ordered for my fiero isn_'_t like the factory original and had the wrong part number for a fiero .
neutral	the one partsgeek sent was for the drivers_side .
neutral	i ordered the one for the passenger_side .
neutral	we ordered 0 plaques from plaquemaker . com .
neutral	the pricing on their site is a bit_confusing , so we recommend a phone_call to confirm pricing for the plaque or award that you want .
neutral	just to be sure .
neutral	we ordered 0 photo plaques and 0 metal plaques .
neutral	all were received in a timely_manner .
neutral	my only comment on the quality of the plaques is that the photo plaques were oversaturated a bit , making the image darker than the actual photo , losing some detail , and making skin tones appear flushed ( a bit magenta ).
neutral	i would order the photo plaques again , however , due to their unique nature .
neutral	i might call ahead with the next order to make_sure that they see if they can address the oversaturation issue .
neutral	the costume was inexpensive , so i did not expect much .
neutral	the good news , the product arrived on schedule and quality on general was acceptable .
neutral	however , the item was not exactly as pictured , the front tunic panel was missing ( qui - gon jinn ), so i had to cobble something together that doesn_'_t match .
neutral	and based on the size_chart , i ordered the standard size - but the costume is way too small .
neutral	xl would have fit far better , but i need the costumer today so i just have to make do with safety pins .
neutral	so some good , some not ...
neutral	i was happy to get my part in the mail .
neutral	however , i was very disappointed about the packaging .
neutral	there was no wrap around it , protection , or anything of that nature .
neutral	you just grabbed the part , found the smallest box it would fit in , and shipped it .
neutral	i hope it works ...
neutral	also , the free shipping thing is a joke .
neutral	i don_'_t know if it is free shipping or not .
neutral	i see this rebate thing , but i think it will be some virus or spam pop_up stuff so i don_'_t click on it .
neutral	the free shipping must specify clearly that it is free shipping " after the rebate "
neutral	p_&_p a lot for sutch a small item
neutral	i ' d like to give a great review , but as of today , i '_m still without a part .
neutral	at this point i think it '_s less of the " geeks " problem as it is ups , just want geeks to know .
neutral	my part was supposed to arrive last friday 0 / 00 .
neutral	not a problem .
neutral	but on thursday at noon , ups_tracking noted they transferred package to local usps for delivery .
neutral	well , it '_s monday the 0rd and i really wish the part had arrived on time so i could have spent the weekend fixing the car part issue !
neutral	ups , in the future , please just deliver it to my house !
neutral	maybe partsgeek needs to have a talk with them ?
neutral	was good service ....
neutral	they told me wrong sizes on almost everything .
neutral	hi i had a very good experience with your company , but a couple things were lacking .
neutral	first , you do not have enough information in your technical descriptions to solidify purchases .
neutral	because of this , i ordered the wrong parts that i needed .
neutral	i opened a ticket for an_rma which was prompt and effective .
neutral	however , since there was limited part information , i contacted you to help me make the correct purchase but never_heard back from an agent in the 00 - 00 hour period you stated on your web_page .
neutral	i even tried to call but could not get a direct rep .
neutral	being in ohio the weather gave_me a wiindow to work on my car so i had to purchase the parts that i needed locally .
neutral	i hope this he ; lps and i will look to you for parts in the future .
neutral	hopefully i will get enough information to make the right purchases and we will all be happy .
neutral	come on , 0 digits for voice_mail retrieval as the pin .
neutral	while_searching online for a way to make a reservation at the embassy_suites , i had no other option from my search landing page .
neutral	the reservation process was easy and efficient but i was not given the option to use my hilton_honors account information .
neutral	i didn_'_t feel as confident about using the reservation site verses using a site that was in direct relationship with embassy_suites or hilton .
neutral	the glasses did not have glass lenses and are poly .
neutral	i even called up to check as the website said glass .
neutral	i would not have bought them if they had been advertised and if the person on the phone had not said they were not glass .
neutral	i feel i was mislead .
neutral	other than that postage and dealing_with them was good and quick .
neutral	rebtel is apparently an over the internet phone service .
neutral	it is cheaper_than most phone card schemes , and reduces the number of digits one must dial from 00 to 00 .
neutral	however , the sound quality is not always as good as it should be , and calls are often just dropped for no apparent_reason , followed by redialing that does not reconnect the call .
neutral	t reconnect , i must hang_up and redial again .
neutral	all the rebtel calls i have made have been to a cellphone in the dominican republic .
neutral	sound quality is also occasionally terrible when using calling cards to the same country from the us .
neutral	good experience website was easy to navigate order process was a bit difficult to complete .
neutral	but after order was complete transaction when smoothly .
neutral	ordered on line on saturday 00th and went to collect tuesday 00th .
neutral	0 other people at counter 0 was being served .
neutral	i pressed the bell for express collect and one of the waiting customers said he ' d done that 0 minutes ago and no response .
neutral	he left fed up waiting , then 0 customer left without being attended to .
neutral	eventually the staff_member serving the first cutomer asked if i was collecting and broke off serving to get my collection .
neutral	i received what i ordered , and in a timely_fashion , but i didn_'_t get the free pill splitter that they advertise comes with the order .
neutral	when i called about it they told me the pharmacy must have ran_out and it was very rare that they run out .
neutral	then they told me i should buy one at walgreens .
neutral	they never said they would send me one , or they never offered anything_else to compensate me .
neutral	not very good customer service .
neutral	update_: 0 / 00 / 00
neutral	kyle the cs manager contacted me by email and told me they would send me a pill splitter ( i '_m sure only because of the 0_star_rating i gave accessrx here on trust_pilot ?
neutral	... you decide ).
neutral	he then said : " also if you cancel the poor remark made on trust_pilot and give us a 0_star_rating i will discount you 00 . 00 off your order ."
neutral	so he was trying to buy a 0_star_rating from me !
neutral	what a joke !
neutral	i wonder_how many 0_star_ratings he has bought , or tried to buy ?!
neutral	he should have made the offer without asking for anything and then let_me make the decision to change my feedback , not tell me what he will give me if i change it !
neutral	anyway , i replied and told_him how unethical he is , and then blocked his email address and phone_number .
neutral	also , i get these notes in emails i receive from accessrx . com : " be_careful !
neutral	this sender failed our fraud detection checks ."
neutral	this is the only company i have ever got notes like this in their emails .
neutral	i have a top - notch firewall and plenty of virus_protection , but i find it a bit creepy though .
neutral	this would be awesome except the link through lyoness has_been down all weekend .
neutral	when i buy several at once why can '_t they be shipped together to save packageing and shipping_costs , are you ever going to have larger denominations , $ 0000 - 00000 ?
neutral	thanks .
neutral	when i get to the part of checkout where i fill in my billing information , and allow safari to auto - fill , the choice of country is unchosen .
neutral	when i choose country , the auto - filled information is removed .
neutral	back and forth , back and forth .
neutral	i had to fill in this information by manually typing into each field .
neutral	it took me a while to figure this out , since my only feedback was " hey , you missed a field or two , please finish "
neutral	i bought my key 0 am their time and had to wait 00_hours to get it that was quite annoying also when i got my key it '_s in another language ( russian ) and i can '_t play the game - _ -
neutral	i really_liked the ability to find local places on yelp and read up their reviews .
neutral	but my recent experience hasnt been so well .
neutral	i was in the mood for middleeastern food and found a great restaurant with super reviews , but when i arrived there it was a small local joint and empty inside .
neutral	it was a let_down .
neutral	i was not able to understand how to arrange for bringing skies , and how much it would cost .
neutral	it is not very easy to recover a saved quote .
neutral	i ended_up having to fill all the details in again for a new quote .
neutral	i was happy with purchase prices good value had a problem with bath tap but company are sending out replacement today .
neutral	the two times i had to go to collect goods i was kept waiting on both_occasions for one and half hours instead of 00 to 00_mins as told by sales_staff on second visit after waiting over an_hour had to go to new warehouse which took me ages to find as no signage up for better_bathrooms warehouse staff at new place very helpful , took a long time on phone to get through to customer_services but overall happy with goods
neutral	i found the delivery and the bath to my satisfaction except for two missing feet which should have been in the delivery order but the plumber managed to bore holes in my old baths feet and we managed to fit it onto the new one . but all in all happy enough with the bath , which i havnt used yet as i havnt got round to wiring it up . will tell you once its up and going . regards
neutral	ordered what i thought to be an atp control solenoid .
neutral	when part was received it was not atp it was borg wagner not what i had ordered .
neutral	furthermore the gasket that was packed with the solenoid was bent and cracked , luckily was not damaged to the point of not being used with a little tlc .
neutral	i could have purchased a borg wagner 00 . 00 cheaper_elsewhere .
neutral	would have returned part but could not wait another week to two_weeks to have part for car .
neutral	needed car for work .
neutral	not impressed partsgeek .
neutral	would like to receive the brand that i ordered .
neutral	on your web_site you have atp solenoid for 000 . 00 .
neutral	says nothing about borg wagner .
neutral	part works that '_s worth 0_stars .
neutral	the hostel bathrooms were quite dirty and the room had no windows , just a boarded wall .
neutral	the hostel seems to have been built in an old apartment building , and the breakfast is free , but minimal .
neutral	other than that , the hostel was acceptable .
neutral	the pub crawl is great .
neutral	attention dans_le_choix de_vos transporteurs .
neutral	colissimo très_bien .
neutral	par_contre la_livraison par camion est à revoir .
neutral	le livreur a balancé le_colis au - dessus de_la grille et a imité notre signature .
neutral	i reserved a 0x00 unit online for $_00 a month but when i got to the selfstorage office they said that they don_'_t even have 0x00 units at all and for that price .
neutral	they only have 0x00 .
neutral	they had a promotional discount for different_sizes , so i ended_up getting a 0x00 unit .
neutral	i accept that traffic in london is heavy but the service is really slow !
neutral	!
neutral	also blue_route seems to go in 0 seperate routes but why is this not displayed on outside of bus ?
neutral	?
neutral	staff helpful if you ask any questions which redeems the service
neutral	i love to order from parts_geek and they normally get to my home very quick but there customer service i '_m afraid really needs work i have tried to call them over 00 times and i have done the support_ticket thing and no response i really would feel better if someone i could talk to because i ordered a part and it was faulty and i need to send a core back but i dont_know how and where to send it
neutral	my order was placed on 00 . 00 . 00 and delivery was promised for 00 . 00 . 00 .
neutral	it is now 00 . 00 . 00 and i have not received my order .
neutral	the hermes site says order processed 00 . 00 . 00 .
neutral	i have spoken with the my protein customer service team , on an 0000 number , who were apologetic for the delay in delivery .
neutral	i have used my protein several_times before without_any_problems such as this .
neutral	i have now been without protein for a number of days because of the issues with delivery .
neutral	the parts , prices , timing are good .
neutral	the delivery service ( fedex ) is very bad .
neutral	the fedex driver severely_damaged a tree ( several branches broken ) along my driveway yet left without stopping to apologize .
neutral	ups and ontrac had delivered the day before without_any_problems .
neutral	i strongly_recommend eeuroparts to change the delivery service .
neutral	obviously fedex doesn_'_t care too much about customers , i didn_'_t hear_anything from them after my complaint .
neutral	great prices but not enough product information .
neutral	enough already about the " free merchandise ," which actually adds to the shipping cost even for a product of no significant weight or size .
neutral	site is not as easy to navigate as many other supplement sites .
neutral	0 % price match is unbeatable , though .
neutral	i thought this had the lowest_price range for books .
neutral	i openly went to each of the main book renter websites and found these books to be the cheapest .
neutral	i thought that my books were going to come sooner , but for a cheaper price i '_m willing to accept it .
neutral	thanks ,
neutral	my clubs showed delivered to an address that was not listed on my shipment and caused me about 00_minutes of complete and utter craziness trying to find out where my clubs were and no one seemed to mind that my clubs were lost .
neutral	and then 00_mins_later my dad said they were delivered .
neutral	i can '_t believe i had to go through that for a paperwork issue .
neutral	delivery made on time however not in so asked to collect from local parcel_force depot .
neutral	this is 00 miles_away !
neutral	arranged to collect from local post_office .
neutral	next_day , 0 . 00am , parcel_force turn up with delivery .
neutral	good quick service but questionable courier service
neutral	the delivery that i recieve takes days ..
neutral	even if i choose free delivery in other_places like fragrance_direct and perfume shop i get it quicker_than you guys !
neutral	it takes ages for you guys to post an item and for me to recieve it !
neutral	!
neutral	we had luck that there was still a room available , but the desk didn_'_t see the booking before we were there .
neutral	it '_s better to call the hotel after you make a reservation , so they check their online bookings .
neutral	had no problem making the purchase and finding what i wanted .
neutral	goods seem incompatible with the site ( forsaken world - neverwinter ) as bought in us dollars and convertible in pound sterling but site only allows redemption in set figures in euros .
neutral	am still_waiting on help from them , on how to proceed and not been able to utalise my purchase .
neutral	i understand that the issue is third_party related but still hold your company with some of the responsibility in ensuring the products you sell are compatible with redeeming party , hence the ' so - so ' rating
neutral	price of one plastic replacement valve was half the price of a new complete shower ; no wonder some call us a throwaway society .
neutral	one of my friends recommended i try including a mace routine for me and my clients .
neutral	after giving it some thought i went all in and purchased all three of the maces that onnit offers ( 00 # , 00 #, 00 #).
neutral	the maces arrived in a timely_manner .
neutral	the 00 # and the 00 # looked just like the mace on their website ( flat black with white lettering ).
neutral	however , the 00 # was totally different and sub_par quality .
neutral	the 00 # had a glassy black finish and the letter wasn_'_t the same font and it wasn_'_t painted .
neutral	what '_s worse is that when you sit it upright you can clearly see that the handle is crooked .
neutral	if it were for my personal use i would not really care but i already have clients lined_up to try the maces in their workouts .
neutral	my equipment should reflect high_quality and attention to detail in order to promote confidence and safety .
neutral	i contacted onnit and spoke with john .
neutral	john told me that they sent me an " old style " 00 # and the new style are still in production .
neutral	we worked it out so that they would send me a return_label and expedite me a new one .
neutral	that is a solution to a problem that should never have happened in my opinion .
neutral	i should have been informed ahead of time that the 00 # was from a different stock and given a choice prior to shipping .
neutral	at_least that '_s how i would have handled it .
neutral	as it is i can only rate them 0_stars and nothing higher until all transactions are final .
neutral	the resolution is still in the works and i am waiting to be impressed .
neutral	meant to be cream but was white that had been sprayed very badly , if i ' d had more time i would have sent it back not a good advert !!!
neutral	!
neutral	product is priced equal to value .
neutral	quality is merely fair , considering the coating began flaking upon 0nd use .
neutral	this is disappointing .
neutral	should have used a powder coating to resist this .
neutral	fitness gear is non_- refundable , so i '_ll have to live with it .
neutral	i would be fairly critical with future_purchases of products of this type from this seller .
neutral	i bought a passenger_mirror for my 00 dakota , the part was inexpensive but when i installed it i noticed it had a weird distortion to it even for a convex mirror .
neutral	next time i buy authentic dodge parts !
neutral	my confirmed reservation was for a " bmw series 0 " or equivalent .
neutral	upon_arrival at the counter , i was handed the keys to a mazda .
neutral	few people would consider this an " equivalent ".
neutral	when i declined the mazda , they said the only german car available " in my category " was an opel , which included gps ( which i did not want ).
neutral	i took the opel and was pleased with it , but it cost me €_000 more than for what i had contracted with you .
neutral	if you had a number listed where i could '_ve called , i wouldn_'_t have had to send back an item or wait 0 days to get it , then send it back and wait a week or 0 to have my credit back to my account .
neutral	that was a waste of time .
neutral	i could '_ve called immediately and told you to cancel .
neutral	only 0 minutes had elapsed before i noticed an error .
neutral	please , see review above .
neutral	bought a physical_copy of guild_wars 0 online .
neutral	the price was the best i could find but it ended_up taking a week when delivery time was 0 - 0 days .
neutral	this could have been because of the snow but other reviews have called out long delivery times .
neutral	the product price was great and it did get delivered so i wonder_if you have to sacrifice speed of service accordingly ?
neutral	i will be back but just not when i need something in a hurry .
neutral	parts_geek has great prices ... i mean really great !!
neutral	how ever if you try and call to talk to anyone .... no one ever answers ... i understand you can e_-_mail with you questions ... however in my case i needed someone to reach quickly to change the shipping info .. then when i e_- mailed my question it sent back information i already had ... such as my tracking_number .. but looking back if that '_s all i have to bitch about ... life is good .
neutral	my parts were correct ... and saved myself $_000 . 00 !!!!!
neutral	!
neutral	my part was received broken and im still_waiting for someone to contact me to return this one and get a replacement
neutral	hi all
neutral	you seem to need a screwdriver on every joint
neutral	in case it bends the pins annoying really
neutral	the carraige charges should be more obvious
neutral	this is hidden similar to budget airline charges
neutral	ordered 0 led_lamps originally , delighted with them and especially the price , ordered another 00 but this time instead of sending 00 warm_white as requested they sent 0 warm_white and 0 white - which do not match .
neutral	problem ..... i don_'_t have anywhere in our home that just needs 0 lights !
neutral	still trying to find out how to resolve this problem , oddly all the lamps have the same code on even_though they are different shades of white when working .
neutral	perhaps that '_s why they were cheap .
neutral	i am always totally_satisfied with my protein in terms of range , quality and value , but the delivery is slow , the tracking_number never works and customer_services either don_'_t respond or take a week to do so !
neutral	before now orders have been cancelled ( by my protein ) due to updating operating_systems ( but as a customer you don_'_t get informed for several days ) or for other baffling reasons ( system thought it was a duplicate order !)
neutral	i usually qualify for free delivery as i downs around £_000 per order , i appreciate it '_s not likely to arrive the next_day , but after a few_days i may choose to track it , but the provided number never works !
neutral	nice frames .
neutral	poor quality bifocals
neutral	i have ordered several screens and the majority of them have been defective upon delivery .
neutral	the latest screen has a full on down by the clock in the bottom right corner the previous screen to that was the incorrect one for the model .
neutral	the website is very good with a great range of products and everything is efficient the only let_down is ups delivery which is poor - : attempts no delivery and they expected me to pick_up the delivery from croydon .
neutral	i would prefer to pay a bit more and get the option of royal_mail at_least if they can '_t deliver you only need to go to a local depot which is much more convenient .
neutral	please review your delivery options and i will make further orders .
neutral	good deal on the part , but 0 business days to receive shipping fromwithin the same state when it is claimed to be in stock ?
neutral	terrible .
neutral	sometimes have to call many_times to connect
neutral	it took 0 days to deliver my item and took 0 payments out of my bank instead of just one and still_waiting 0 days_later for the refund of the 0 payments owed to me which is 000_pounds i am not happy
neutral	amongst othe rthings i ordered 0 pcie extension cables from them only 0 came - i phoned and requested the missing 0 they apologised and put it on a 00 hour delivery - when it arrived it was only 0 again !
neutral	had to phone again and they put it on a 00 hour delivery - nice enougt people to deal with but they got my first order wrong twice :( so i cant really recommend them .
neutral	i experienced a good and easy booking service on bravofly , but i had great trouble at the check in on vueling , since they claimed that i was not allowed to check in more than one bag , although i '_ve payed for en extra bag .
neutral	according to vueling , i was only allowed to have a maximum weight of 00 kg divided into two bags .
neutral	this information was something i hadn_'_t seen on either the page of bravofly nor vueling , and made me pay an extra 00 euros owerweight .
neutral	i will send my complaints to vueling but i am deeply dissatisfied with the clarity of the information from both bravofly and vueling .
neutral	in the future , i will_continue looking for prices on bravofly , but newer book with vueling again , since the communication and information between the two companies seen to not have been the best .
neutral	at empire state building i had to buy a ticket as anyone_else and to wait like anyone_else .
neutral	prices are great but if you are expecting to speak with a live_person to find out status or do anything regarding your order forget about it .
neutral	part of my order was delayed 0 week and all i could do was open tickets with a 00 - 00 hr response time .
neutral	if you not in a hurry to get your parts then you should be ok .
neutral	bought a radiator and a ac .
neutral	condenser for my car radiator was missing a nut insert to hold the condenser to it then found that the condensers mounting_brackets would not line up with the radiator called to get help getting replacements you do everything on line i guess .
neutral	i filled_out my return request waited for my o k to return remounted the brackets fixed what i bought and got my car back on the road .
neutral	would be nice to talk to a human when you have a problem .
neutral	still_waiting for a response from parts_geek bought from them before but first time trying to return anything .
neutral	i ordered a range of decorative sockets and fittings to be installed in my living_room .
neutral	after 0 working days i decided to chase about the order in case items were out of stock .
neutral	i was told that a number of items i had ordered were on back - order with the supplier but that they would be receiving a shipment from the supplier that day and the order would go out that day or the following_day .
neutral	after_hearing nothing from ukelectricalsupplies or receiving anything in the post i contacted customer_support a second time to find out what the status of my order was .
neutral	i was told that my sockets were still on back - order from the supplier and that they would send the rest of my order out separately whilst they wait for stock of the sockets .
neutral	again after_hearing nothing from them ( no shipping notifications ), my sockets finally arrived after a 0 week wait .
neutral	although the customer_support was mostly helpful .
neutral	not having a notice of shipping or clear indication of lead times on their products would make me thing twice about ordering from ukelectricalsupplies again .
neutral	for those of us that have been doing fantasy_football for a long time ( for me over 00 years ,) the interface for the site is rather rudimentary .
neutral	the graphics are not the most pleasing to the eye and the live scoring is ok but the site is nowhere_near the level of a cbs sports .
neutral	the biggest problem i had was having to contact the commissioner twice to fix the playoff matchups .
neutral	i shouldn_'_t have to do it once but twice is really not acceptable .
neutral	i expect some minimal level of service for the percentage the commish is taking .
neutral	received on
neutral	y one quick response .
neutral	seller assured me goods were in good order .
neutral	i asked for supporting photos .
neutral	photos appeared to show goods were rusty and holed .
neutral	i was told goods were ok and would be checked at dismantling .
neutral	i had to pay upfront for goods to be dismantled and inspected .
neutral	on inspection the goods were as i thought and i had to be refunded .
neutral	overall a poor experience as the selled should be well aware of .
neutral	the condition of the goods before ian upfront !
neutral	evrything worked well for my rental in lesotho , but i have requested a detailed tax invoice on 0 occasions now - and has not received one .
neutral	please sort this out and i will be more impressed .
neutral	i have ordered parts from parts_geek before .
neutral	it is one of my " go to " parts places .
neutral	only_thing about my most_recent order is that i was sent the wrong part .
neutral	i ordered a front lower left control_arm and the order was received in a timely_fashion but it was the control_arm for the right side .
neutral	fortunately i need one for both_sides and i will be placing another order for the front lower left control_arm and i pray that you send me the correct one i order .
neutral	also it strikes me as odd that when one calls the outgoing message says " all of our operators are busy assisting other calls " but later the system hangs_up .
neutral	either operators are busy or you don_'_t really take calls .
neutral	should be one or the other .
neutral	other than that i like your site and i refer people to it all the time .
neutral	i '_m getting this email to review parts_geek before getting an_email in reply to my support_ticket .
neutral	i wanted to know where my part was , so i contacted parts_geek on their website to ask this question .
neutral	they still have not contacted me four days_later , but at_least my package is finally on it '_s way .
neutral	it may have been fedex and maybe parts_geek .
neutral	it was likely caused_by sandy , so i won_'_t be too hard , but it would be nice for a reply to my support_ticket .
neutral	they should add customer service phone_number .
neutral	other than that , they have a really good selection of parts and beat out the competition on parts .
neutral	they were the only parts store i could find with a moog driver_side control_arm for my ford_ranger with bushings and ball bearing .
neutral	parking was close , easy and efficient .
neutral	pick_up from airport on return was a disaster - over an_hour between calling for pickup and being picked_up by shuttle .
neutral	tip - for the holiday_inn crystal city , alamo rental_car is about 00 meters away from the holiday_inn - so an_alternative if the hotel pickup is as bad as it was for us .
neutral	still_waiting for part of my order , survey should be sent after the complete order has_been confirmed
neutral	finding the engine coils was a breeze ... have just been waiting for a week for them to arrive .
neutral	took 0 days just to receive shipping confirmation , seemed way too_long in this day and age .
neutral	i did not find a packing_slip with my order .
neutral	and the reason there was a delivery issue is becasue when the delivery was attemped to my mechanic no one was there that day and i had to go thru a lot to get ups to say they would give it to me at the hub .
neutral	i had printed off a copy of the order and my emails .
neutral	my name wasn_'_t even on the label .
neutral	big mistake !!!
neutral	my name should '_ve shown somewhere on there as owner and the delivery address to my mechanic !
neutral	please make_sure these issues are resolved in the future .
neutral	express mail shipping should be faster .
neutral	00ft_trampoline - delivered in quick time .
neutral	designed different from shown in pictures on website but this was stated after looking again .
neutral	one of the brackets wouldn_'_t fit and i had to make adjustements with a file to remove some excess welding from a poor weld .
neutral	quite a poor quality bumper surround supplied with the trampoline which i am unsure how long it will last .
neutral	overall ok for the money but no better quality that trampolines for similar price from other_suppliers including ebay which include a net enclosure and this one didn_'_t .
neutral	i thought the title airking pro would have meant it was a better quality .
neutral	too much hassle to send back so have kept it .
neutral	product showed_up as_described however order took 00 days from the date it was ordered to ship .
neutral	first order this month arrived quick .
neutral	second order - part of my order was shipped to wrong_address and in texas - i am in arkansas .
neutral	no customer contact number to call to ask about order , just e_-_mail that takes 0 to 0 days to reply back .
neutral	the book came in a timely_manner , the price was fair .
neutral	but the book had water_damage , can still be used .
neutral	just not in very good shape .
neutral	i ordered a purge solenoid for my chrysler .
neutral	ups says it was delivered but it wasn_'_t .
neutral	partsgeek . com sent another one and is filing a tracer for me .
neutral	i hope i won_'_t wind up having to pay for the second solenoid .
neutral	only problem with partsgeek is you can '_t talk to anyone .
neutral	it '_s all by a form and that '_s not good .
neutral	you stand improvement on your payment_methods
neutral	i got charged a dollar for who_knows what !
neutral	no merchandise was involved , but i know how to fix this .
neutral	i need a vpn to source my searches from other_countries , but this comes at a price :
neutral	the connection speed goes down dramatically , sometimes making surfing the net impossible .
neutral	second problem , when i had to download the new version of the hma software , the program stopped_working with the " not responding " message .
neutral	using a few tricks and certainly not just hitting download now , i was able to install the new s / w , but it took a lot of effort .
neutral	bottom_line : i cannot do w_/ o it , but a source of frustration
neutral	before i opened the box i could hear dog_food loose in the shipping box .
neutral	thinking some had gotten out during shipping .
neutral	when i opened the box the bag was empty the whole bag had ripped open on the bottom of the bag .
neutral	bob smith
neutral	i wanted to add the insurance_coverage at the time i placed the reservation , so i knew what the total_cost would be , but that option was not given to me .
neutral	i saw the estimated cost prior to placing the reservation so i had some idea what to expect , but was just not given the option to include it with the reservation .
neutral	quote was in us dollars , but charge at destination was in euros , and did not show the discount for what i prepaid with the reservation .
neutral	there was 00 + euros in vat , but i didn_'_t have an invoice to claim it and obtain a refund .
neutral	( car was returned before avis opened for the day )
neutral	in general the service was great , the delivery was on time and they took everything where it needed to be .
neutral	the quality of the furniture is fantastic and we are very happy with it .
neutral	the only problem was when finance was taken out , a 00_% deposit was paid , and finance had not had that removed , so effectively 00_% of the total_cost had been charged initially then without me calling both oak_furniture land and hitachi twice i would have been paying 00_% extra for no reason .
neutral	having said that the second customer service personnell i spoke to with oak_furniture land was extremely_helpful and i received a call back later the same day to explain what they would do to resolve it .
neutral	this detracted from the overall experience but as mentioned , the furniture is exactly_what we wanted and extremely solid and well made ..
neutral	i would like to make a couple of points about my experience w drive time .
neutral	overall , it was acceptable and i am pleased with my car , but there have been some problems within two_days of sale .
neutral	for starters the dealership did not tell me my car was a flexfuel car which is capable of using e00 .
neutral	no gas stations in my area sell e00 !
neutral	do you think that you should have disclosed that i can put regular unleaded gasoline in the car ?
neutral	i drove around to five freaking gas stations looking for e00 , frantic that i might run out of gas .
neutral	also , the tpms service light ( not a flat_tire ) came on immediately , i wasnt 00 miles from the dealership !
neutral	other than that - i like the fact that drivetime salesmen are not " on you " when you pull onto the lot .
neutral	that is a plus .
neutral	for the most part , my experience was about a c + and i do apologize to one of the salesman who i used inappropriate language towards .
neutral	i was mad at the situation - not him .
neutral	i had to grind the 00mm nuts at 0 corners in order to get a socket on them .
neutral	they were distorted but the swage operation for thread locking .
neutral	but , i got both kits for half what autozone wanted !
neutral	winner !
neutral	problems with ordering , then 0 week delay with product delivery .
neutral	had to chase my order up rather_than proactive management .
neutral	equipment seems good and price was good , just a wee_bit amateurish with the service .
neutral	so_far have used only the black_cartridge , # 00 , for my lexmark_printer and the results are not nearly as good as a lexmark -- often grey tones or no tones .
neutral	price is very good , but poor printing not so good .
neutral	print quality seems to be improving as i print more , but not great .
neutral	order ack by hombz received away but didn_'_t like their caveats that implied shipper / vendor responsible for further communications on order ack and shipping info and could not speak for them .
neutral	looks_like sears was the eventual vendor but their lack of ord ack within a couple / three_days made the experience worrisome .
neutral	ordered because you showed you had everything i needed .
neutral	you later told me you didn_'_t have everything .
neutral	card arrived second class mail after requesting chosen despatch date 0 days earlier and meant having to buy an off the shelf card instead as birthday had passed .
neutral	this is the first time i have not received a card when mailed first_class .
neutral	cardtown made poor attempt at recovery .. 0 days to reply and then asked for copy of envelope and order number so not really on top of customer service .
neutral	lots of other similar companies doing " what it says on the label "..
neutral	i will consider my options carefully .
neutral	every month i have had to call in and then fax address verification info to get my updated credit_scores .
neutral	i don_'_t know why ig doesn_'_t keep this on file , but it has_been very frustrating and time - consuming to keep doing this .
neutral	also , the mobile_app is outdated and will not load onto our phones .
neutral	the service is good for monitoring and security but is not very user - friendly .
neutral	i have done a lot of business with projectorpeople in the past through personal purchases and referrals to my customers amounting to 00 + projectors over the past several_years .
neutral	having purchased a new home for myself , i am installing my own theater and ordered a projector and screen on the website .
neutral	the projector was shipped quickly and worked great , as i have always come to expect from my past experience with projectorpeople .
neutral	i got a call after the order was placed , thanking_me for my business and providing contact numbers .
neutral	the screen however was not such a great experience .
neutral	after several days of not having seen a tracking_number for the screen , i finally called pp .
neutral	my sales_rep was not in the office so i spoke to another rep .
neutral	i asked about the tracking_number and was told that the screen was coming on pilot freight lines , which is why i wasn_'_t seeing a tracking_number .
neutral	he told me that the screen was scheduled to be delivered on a day last_week where i was going to be out of town .
neutral	i asked_him if they could reschedule delivery for today , june 0 , so that i could be here to sign for it .
neutral	he put me on hold and came back on the line and told me that delivery was rescheduled for today .
neutral	since nothing had come today , i called pp again and this time spoke to my rep .
neutral	he told me that the way it worked was that i had to call pilot to schedule a delivery time .
neutral	when i explained my earlier conversation with his_colleague he told me that they can '_t schedule the freight delivery on their end , it has to be done by me .
neutral	when i asked " how was i supposed to know that ?".
neutral	he told me that i should have been contacted with the information .
neutral	i had received no email and no calls .
neutral	he gave_me the number for pilot and the tracking_number ( it actually does exist ).
neutral	i called pilot and was told , " there is a note here that we weren_'_t supposed to deliver until after june 0 " ( evidently communication can happen from pp to the shipper , it was just not the correct communication ).
neutral	he asked me if i would like to set_up a delivery time .
neutral	i was transferred to the local facility and a very helpful pilot rep set_up my delivery for tomorrow ( meanwhile i waited around all day today for a shipment that would have never come had i not called pp ).
neutral	here is where it gets even more frustrating .
neutral	about 0 minutes after i got off of the phone with pilot , i got an_automated phone_call from pilot telling_me that i needed to call their facility to schedule a delivery time .
neutral	someone was asleep on this one .
neutral	it almost seems like my call to pp today woke them up and they called the shipper to get the next phase of this $_000 delivery going .
neutral	i am a big_fan of projectors and had three in my old home ( sold with the house ) and just installed the first of three in my new home .
neutral	i am a big_fan of projectorpeople , as evidenced by my business with them .
neutral	i could have purchased this projector for less money from b_&_h_photo or other authorized_dealer , but i went with pp because of my incredible satisfaction with their service in the past .
neutral	i feel_like this time around they dropped the ball despite my efforts to help them keep it in play with my call a several days ago and the revelations today .
neutral	i am hoping that there are no more surprises with the screen .
neutral	i have to admit , that with my past experience with the excellent communication from pp and their knowledge of my issues with this delivery , i am surprised that pp hasn_'_t at_least called me to follow_up to make_sure i have been taken_care of by pilot .
neutral	i even told my rep , " i '_m going to be upset if i call pilot and find out that delivery hasn_'_t been scheduled for today ".
neutral	my phone remains silent .
neutral	with this experience , i '_m not sure that i can forego saving $_00 + on the projector and mount to maintain my loyalty to pp .
neutral	disappointed ....
neutral	the process of ordering , dealing_with issues needs improving ...
neutral	the electronic communication is good but there may be a need to speak to salesperson or customer service .
neutral	your system send the customer back to the email system which can be quite troublesome and annoying .
neutral	i usually buy from a local butcher who has the highest_quality meat .
neutral	i bought the new customer meat box for £_00 which is a great price .
neutral	the chicken_breast is excellent value , tastes fine but don_'_t think it is free range which puts me off .
neutral	the braising steak was nice .
neutral	the corn_fed chicken was not the best and just didn_'_t taste right , and i was put off when i read about corn - fed chicken and how they are reared - they are also given high amounts of antibiotics because of their living conditions which can reduce the quality of the meat and also means high amounts of antibiotics passes into our food chain .
neutral	had the " lean mince " for tea tonight - will not purchase anymore - full of situ and cartilage and tasted awful .
neutral	would compare to little more than value supermarket mince .
neutral	not had anything_else yet so no further reviews but although this meat is adequate i will be going back to my butchers .
neutral	paying a little more for a lot higher quality is worth it imo .
neutral	i like it for the name your own price option , but make_sure you review everything before you go forward , because if something changes while your in the bidding process and you don_'_t catch it , your screwed .
neutral	they will not do anything to help you .
neutral	so keep this in mind .
neutral	other than that it '_s a good service .
neutral	took to long for pitem to arrive , probably_won_'_t get any more products from partsgeek !
neutral	vehicle drop_off was fine , no_issues .
neutral	collection however not so good .
neutral	car was driven to me at the terminal with a flat back tyre , not impressed with that .
neutral	it turned_out to be a slow puncture so it would have been flat at the compound and not done on route to me .
neutral	emailed the firm about this but no response .
neutral	incredible choice of every spirit and brand of spirit .
neutral	mix_up with my order where the wrong_size was sent .
neutral	matter very quickly resolved but thought that due to inconvenience to myself a complimentary item or future discount_voucher may have been sent or offered but did not .
neutral	we recently reserved a small car for a one day trip into brugge , belgium after returning from a baltic cruise which ended in amsterdam .
neutral	the check - in process was very smooth as we had pre_- paid before leaving home on our vacation ... we were also pleasantly_surprised to be given a little larger car than what we were expecting .
neutral	we added my wife as an_additional driver and were told that the " only " additional_charge we would have would be 00 euros for the added driver , unless we didn_'_t fill the tank with gas .
neutral	upon our return later that evening , we checked the car in , with a full_tank of gas , and were presented with an_additional bill of 000_euros ... 00 euros above the expected 00 euros we were told .
neutral	i disputed the extra_charges , but to no_avail - my one day car_rental ended_up costing over $_000 us dollars .
neutral	needless to say , we are very dissatisfied !!!
neutral	!
neutral	ordered a plain t - shirt in small , the shirt itself was perfect , good quality , exactly the same as on the site ; but the size was way too big , and dwarfed all the other small garments i own .
neutral	not that this '_ll put me off shopping , i '_ll give boohoo another go least , prices are good , range extensive and delivery fast .
neutral	i ordered parts for my 0000_jeep the main part a bumper_cover was the wrong part , they sent me a part for . a grand_prix . the other parts we right now i have to send it back but i have to fly back to north dakota in 0 days and they wont answer the phone for anything . i need my part i paid for and i need it in georgia .
neutral	where the car is . i dont come_back for 0 months this is wrong i dont need this headache for their mistake ᤾
neutral	previously used stressfree at_luton on 0 occasions and the service was very good .
neutral	at_gatwick the collection was right on time but delivery back took over 00mins .
neutral	i had to call 0 times before i got a straight answer .
neutral	operative said car had to be jetwashed before it could be brought to me .
neutral	when it arrived it was still wet and muddy in places .
neutral	i would have thought that as the return date was known the car would have been brought from the parking area and washed earlier .
neutral	it was a shame because i had been pleased before and had recommended the service to friends .
neutral	i hope they have a better experience .
neutral	truly a unique and excellent service !
neutral	ordered a great che button - up shirt in large .
neutral	when it arrived , it said large , but was lucky if it was medium , i think it was small .
neutral	che honored my return & refund , but i didn_'_t want to order x - large as i thought it would be to small .
neutral	i '_m 000_lbs & 0 ' 00 " usually a large t - shirt fits great , even after shrinking in the wash .
neutral	thus , maybe a diagram that shows consistent size parameters would help as i paid shipping to receive the product and shipping to return the product .
neutral	need a warm a fuzzy feeling to order again .
neutral	hope this helps , i like the che - store .
neutral	i like the quality of the product and the variety that qs offers but i wish they would put a little_effort into their shipping_costs for orders under $_000_dollars .
neutral	perhaps a slower shipper like usps could be employed for those of us who don_'_t need our products immediately .
neutral	i have made two orders for a total of about $_00 . 00 and paid $_00 . 00 in shipping .
neutral	i '_m sure a small account like mine is a pain in the neck for qs but even us small users want the quality and selection from this very good company .
neutral	right part , quick ship , good price , can '_t get customer service by phone .
neutral	kept getting fax_machine on customer service line .
neutral	always had good experiences with shopto never had any_issues with orders , place a sizeable order and get issues with the " payment_gateway " so my payment was not allocated to my order and as such my order was not processed when i expected it to be , however called the next_day and was assisted by the customer service people who processed the order and i received it next_day without issues .
neutral	see_above , the part fits fine and i '_m sure we will use your services again .
neutral	i ordered 0 cases of prescription k / d feline cans on march 00 with a requested delivery date of april 00 .
neutral	filled_out all the vet info and got order confirmation on march 00 , expecting delivery on april 00 .
neutral	unfortunately , and with no_explanation , the order wasn_'_t processed until april 00 , charge card charged on april 00 , and the order shipped on april 00 resulting in delivery on april 00 .
neutral	we were on our last can when it finally arrived .
neutral	don_'_t understand_why you ask for a requested delivery date if you seemingly ignore it ?
neutral	this place was difficult to find , even with a gps the last turn is not obvious .
neutral	the surroundings are " unpleasant commercial " including lots of parked trucks in the last 000 yards leading to newark_ltp .
neutral	i had paid ( more ) for self - park ; when i arrived i was met by a sign that said " self parking full ".
neutral	so i had to be valet parked .
neutral	they removed the extra_charge , in the office .
neutral	still ...
neutral	i did not get what i wanted .
neutral	on arrival back to newark i called the number and eventually a van came , i believe they waited to send it until other people expected from the same flight got their luggage and also called .
neutral	i ' d say i stood outside for over 00_minutes , during which i observed three " parking spot " vans depart .
neutral	eventually the ltp van came , and on arrival at ltp my car was waiting , engine on .
neutral	that was better_than i expected .
neutral	my conclusions : 0 ) if my company is willing to pay for limo pickup , i will take it .
neutral	0 ) if i have to drive myself , i probably_won_'_t park at newark_ltp again , i '_ll try parking spot or park in the airport '_s long_term lot .
neutral	i need the response ticket in a timely , matter but to no_avail have purchasing parts from parts_geek for quite some time , i expect some courtesy in return , i would appreciate prompt cooperation , thank_you .
neutral	i purchased two set of glasses from global_eyeglasses on the same order recieving the second_pair at a discount , to my disappointment the first pair of glasses was delivered 0 days after the order and came in a box with a cloth and a case yet whoever packaged the glasses either didnt put the glasses in the case or didnt close the case properly after putting the glasses in , because my first pair arrived with minor_scratches on the lens due to not being in their case , after waiting another day and not recieving my other pair i called usps with the tracking_number they told me they had not picked_up this order and the tracking_# i provided was just a number generated by global_eyeglasses to inform_me that the order has be completed .
neutral	so i called globaleyeglasses and informed them of the situation with the first set of glasses and that i hadnt recieved the 0nd pair .
neutral	the csr inform_me she would locate the 0nd pair and have them to me in 0 day and she would talk to accounting to get a rebate for the first pair .
neutral	the second_pair did arrive the next_day .
neutral	amazingly the glasses were wrapped in the cloth and in the case and they even bubble_wrapped the case , which i thought would happen with the first being that you are dealing_with glasses .
neutral	all in all i paid just over $_00 for 0 pairs of glasses , with one pair arriving in perfect_condition and the other so - so .
neutral	the employees are friendly .
neutral	the price isn_'_t great but comparable to other facility '_s in the area .
neutral	the place has_been open for a while and has some miles .
neutral	the post on which the gate keypad is mounted is lose and moves when you try to punch in your code .
neutral	the light in my unit does not work .
neutral	i went by on a saturday_night at 0 : 00 and found half the flood lights were out and the gate was stuck in an open position .
neutral	i reported the issue .
neutral	it '_s not terrible , just letting you know my opinion since you asked .
neutral	wupti '_s kundeservice er udemærket !
neutral	leveringen er blandet .. har_oplevet at modtage varen dagen_efter_jeg_bestilte den , og modsat har_jeg ventet i en_hel uge på at få leveret en ipod ..
neutral	de tager overpris nogle af produkterne !
neutral	derfor kun 0_stjerner .........................
neutral	rev did a good job of transcribing the words of my dictation from an ipod device .
neutral	the few flubs were understandable : government for governance , for example .
neutral	unfortunately , rev '_s ability to handle formatting was disappointing .
neutral	my resulting transcription had commas and periods in the right places , but also the words " comma ", " period ", " new paragraph ", " quote ", " parentheses " and so forth .
neutral	this took a lot of clean - up work .
neutral	it seemed odd that this was needed since rev inserted the actual quote mark where it was spoken as well as the word " quote ".
neutral	it seems like a system that was smart enough to put in the symbol would have been smart enough to remove the verbalization of the symbol .
neutral	in addition , rev formatted everything with an indent and paragraphs with tabs .
neutral	even_though there was only one speaker , everything was indented so " speaker 0 " could be out - dented .
neutral	this required additional effort to cleanup .
neutral	ridiculous system .
neutral	booking_fee is a rip_off .
neutral	the parts that were sent to me by ups took 0 days , great !
neutral	the parts you sent me using usps took almost a week !!!!!!
neutral	please don_'_t send my parts usps , whenever_possible use ups or fed - ex .
neutral	the t - shirts were awesome , came out great , but was a bit disappointed in the quality of the polos and the caps are terrible ... might as well been made out of paper ... really bad quality , no form or structure to them , the top of the cap collapses to the point where you can '_t even read the logo or website address ...

neutral	i tend to use travelocity frequently , but just found much_cheaper rates with closer airports to my destination that where not given as an option -- frontier airlines .
neutral	wish i had known , would have saved me a lot of money .
neutral	when you update your card details it doesn_'_t change your billing_address !
neutral	this makes no sense to me and as i was in a rush they have now dispatched my order to somewhere i moved out of on bad terms !!!
neutral	!
neutral	ordered 0 pairs of eyeglasses .
neutral	the first came without edge polishing on the lenses , which was specifically ordered .
neutral	called cs , and they asked me send the pair back for polishing .
neutral	this would take a few weeks , so instead i asked for a small refund and they gave_me $_00 on a $_000 pair of eyeglasses .
neutral	second_pair was done right , but shipped without the manufacture oem case and also without the essilor cleaning_cloth ( these are sometimes hard to find ).
neutral	again had to call them back , they have apparently ordered these for me but have not shown up in 0_weeks .
neutral	it all started well , the traffic was bad but this was not a problem as sight_seeing was the purpose of the trip .
neutral	the weather was , it was was very cold and sometimes wet on top of the bus and little could be seen from downstairs
neutral	the real problem occurred when we came out of the victoria and albert museum we waited for half an_hour , no bus .
neutral	we started to walk to get on to another colour bus route we did eventually see another bus near marble_arch , but it said out of service all the bus company reps had disappeared it was now about 00 . 00 , cold and wet , we gave up and took the tube back to our hotel .
neutral	when seeing the bus reps the following_day i was going to complain , but decided against it as it was our wedding_anniversary trip and i did not want to spoil the occasion ..
neutral	your service was first_class right up to delivery then i found one of the lights was delivered faulty .
neutral	then to me your service went down_hill you advertise on line with your literature that you can return faulty goods and you will send the new one out and pick_up the faulty goods .
neutral	but when i phoned to do this . you said with my goods you do not do this .
neutral	i suggest you put that on your web_site . because it is missleading . you said by phone you only do this with sertain goods . i was not very happy with your response when i phoned you
neutral	recipient was very pleased with the arrangement however , i was unhappy with the delivery .
neutral	i had requested a before_noon delivery but arrived almost 0 hours late .
neutral	i ordered a grille for my truck in black and when i received it all the paperwork was properly marked with the correct color but they sent a chrome grille .
neutral	can someone read or is it that they ' re color blind as well ?
neutral	so not only did i get the wrong part and have to wait extra long to receive notification from the company , because they don_'_t have a department you can speak to over the phone when these issues arise , and wait for the correct part to be sent back , i also have to pay return shipping to the company even_though it was their fault .
neutral	i might give them a second chance depending_on what i hear from their representatives when i get a chance to speak to one of them .
neutral	got the item at the best price ... however it took them six days to finally ship the item .
neutral	if i had known it was a special order i could have made a more informed_decision .
neutral	i could have got for 0 dollars more on ebay and received it sooner .
neutral	some communication would have been nice .... the first i heard was after 0 days when they said it was being shipped .
neutral	basically i am a fan of hrs , however bookings . com became extremely user_friendly and has often a broader offering
neutral	' dear mr . ' is not good enough .
neutral	if you want to pretend your computer is a person , you '_ll have to do better_than that .
neutral	the whisky arrives on time , the prices are fair , the selection is excellent .
neutral	but the whisky itself remains the star , not the seller .
neutral	dg
neutral	i bought three shrubs , one arrived in bad shape
neutral	the other two appeared acceptable
neutral	i '_m not sure i ' d purchase from them again and will likely opt for local nurseries since you can see what you are buying
neutral	they don_'_t fit in the case that was sent with the glasses .
neutral	the ear pieces are too_long and stick out when the case is closed .
neutral	i purchased a giftcard for my son in college .
neutral	i chose this company because it said i could upload any picture for the background of the card .
neutral	i uploaded my photo along with the information .
neutral	but , when i recieved the card it did not have the photo of my son i uploaded .
neutral	i was disappointed since that was the whole reason i chose to use this company .
neutral	good value
neutral	poor product compatability why suggest a waste system that '_s completely different size to the plug - and then supply it .
neutral	detracted from what were good products and just made the while installation process frustrating
neutral	i was just a bit upset it took so long to let_me know part waiting on wasn_'_t comming
neutral	i bought a card first for my 0ds but it didnt work , gave them a second chance bought another one the it worked they kinda stole 00 buck from me but then they delivered , i dont really know what to think of them .
neutral	part was to ship on the 0th of the month , did not ship till the 00th .
neutral	it is now the 00th and i do not have the part .
neutral	so , no part , no real review except slow shipping
neutral	kan godt anbefale dk online , men ønsker meget mere information om_det at blive godkendt hos teller .
neutral	vi troede at det_hele ordnede sig på 00 timer .
neutral	og nu_har det taget 0 uger og_har mistet kunder på dette grundlag .
neutral	decent place to get parts .
neutral	pricing is fair but if you have a question no matter_how small or simple they request 00 - 00_hours to get back to you ?
neutral	if i wasn_'_t in a hurry to get my answers that '_s fine , but if time was short and i needed info faster , i wouldn_'_t buy from here .
neutral	sometimes time is something a guy doesn_'_t have .
neutral	in this connected world of ours , instant chat is available .
neutral	some competitive parts distributors use this feature .
neutral	this car part website had best take notice or they will loose out in the long run .
neutral	the phone line service was too_long .
neutral	trying to get help with part i ordered .
neutral	seamed to take a long time to get the part .
neutral	the box it came in looked like someone used it as a kick ball and the part was broken . luckly it was broken in a way that i could still use it .
neutral	i will try this company again but if the service and condition of package are damaged again i may not be so lucky .
neutral	and at that point the low price may not be worth the chance of having to wait for a reorder if the part is in such shape as it is un useable .
neutral	i ordered weather seal trim kits for my two garage doors , a single and double .
neutral	price was good , almost perfect match to original_equipment .
neutral	i waited two_weeks and heard_nothing .
neutral	i called and got a sincere apology that the material was back - ordered .
neutral	it arrived the next_day at north_shore and was shipped .
neutral	i received it a week_later .
neutral	i would have appreciated notice that it was late .
neutral	i am installing it now ..... nice product .... only problem is that it did not come with enough nails .
neutral	i was unable to find any phone numbers to get any information from them .
neutral	the information on the parts is not always complete enough to make a good decision .
neutral	i order two of the same part number lower_ball_joint a different brand was sent than what i ordered .
neutral	even_though they were the same part number ball_joint the rubber boots were different between the two .
neutral	the boot on one was okay and would seal the boot on the other was a different design and does not seal at all .
neutral	i have sent emails to their question and service department no one has replied .
neutral	this company is definitely interested in selling cheap parts and not servicing their customers .
neutral	buyer_beware
neutral	had a screw broken off in one of the boxes . still have not recived the return lable .
neutral	i fixed it with jb weld my self because i needed it .
neutral	could not weight three more weeks that it would take !!
neutral	too_long !
neutral	!
neutral	the site itself was easy to use and good eas of use , but when it came to paying had so many difficulties , and just would not accept my credit_card and kept saying payment failed .
neutral	checked with bank and they confirmed that there were no_issues so tried again and again payment failed .
neutral	yet i used the same card on a different website and payment was fine
neutral	still havn '_t received my product
neutral	ordered several parts and they all showed_up within a week and a half .
neutral	everything except the power_window_regulator fit fine .
neutral	the arm assembly on the regulator was wrong but it was the same motor .
neutral	of course you don " t know until the door is all torn apart .
neutral	i had a limited time to do the repairs so i just swapped out the motors , voiding the warentee .
neutral	if i do it again i will only buy the motor .
neutral	we ordered 00 bully_sticks at an amazing sale price along with a package of 0 rolls of poop_bags .
neutral	everything came thrown in one big box which would have been fine because nothing is breakable .
neutral	however , the package of 0 rolls of poop_bags was torn_open and there were only 0 rolls in the box .
neutral	i tried to call customer service but after listening to on hold music for 0 minutes i got pushed to a voicemail saying no one is available to take my call .
neutral	so , overall great prices but you may be missing some products .
neutral	the payment section of the site often times resets fields when i click on different input sections and i have to re - enter data which is really really annoying because i hate entering form data anyway .
neutral	for example , if i enter the cc_info and i have to edit something on the shipping address , it deletes the cc_info .
neutral	it '_s almost enough for me to go to another shop and i would if this particular equipment was listed for the same price .
neutral	the worse issue that is really dumb is that b_&_h doesn_'_t accept orders while it '_s closed .
neutral	the problem is that they close for every holiday and a bunch that they make up .
neutral	it '_s insane how often they close .
neutral	they should have a system that accepts online orders but let '_s the user know that it won_'_t ship until the shop opens up again .
neutral	i have used_interparcel for several_years and my experience is that the service is generally good .
neutral	however , i sent a package last_year using tnt ( via interparcel ) – which were presentation boards for the 0000 design & art director '_s ( d & ad ) annual design awards competition , but unfortunately these were badly_damaged in transit .
neutral	d & ad notified me that the presentation boards had arrived badly_damaged and requested a replacement set , which cost a further £_00 , plus redelivery costs and vat .
neutral	i submitted a claim to interparcel for the damaged boards and was asked to supply photographic_evidence of the damaged package , together with the invoice for producing a replacement set of presentation boards .
neutral	d & ad were unable to supply me with photographic_evidence because they had disposed of the damaged boards , however , they did send a letter confirming that the boards had arrived badly_damaged .
neutral	i sent the letter from d & ad , together with the copy invoice to interparcel – and photographs of the replacement item and packaging , but they insisted on photographic_evidence of the damaged boards in order to consider the claim .
neutral	i pointed_out this also relies on the recipients ( individuals or businesses ) to have a camera – not all would .
neutral	my claim for compensation was genuine and although i was unable to supply photographic_evidence of the damaged boards , my claim was supported_by good evidence .
neutral	i found interparcel '_s intransigence very frustrating indeed !
neutral	despite the exchange of numerous e_-_mails , they did not compensate me for the cost of replacing the presentation boards .
neutral	because of this , my experience of interparcel '_s service is very mixed .
neutral	price of item toots free shipping .
neutral	yet when it is ordered the customer is made to select a method of shipping and its price that , to me , certainly does not constitute free shipping .
neutral	i have been on other_sites where they say free shipping and though one must pick a method and its price when the final invoice is shown prior to the actual ordering the cost of shipping is deducted so the bottom_line is correct .
neutral	to try to resolve this i went to a chat site .
neutral	well i waited a while and they were so busy i was told to send a email .
neutral	this is my smallest purchase from b and h and not the best handling .
neutral	i used this site throughout my high_school career and i never was disappointed .
neutral	people on here are friendly , information , and here to help so i strongly_recommend it if you are looking for information_regarding high_school sports
neutral	this company has continually impressed me with the great phone service i receive along with the great service i receive at locations all across the nation .
neutral	thank_you and keep it up and ill gaurantee to remain a member
neutral	wowcher is amazing but everything iv ordered by the time it actually gets here i don_'_t need it or have bought it all ready because iv needed it 0 * quality 0 delivery time
neutral	had i know this was a third_party reservation site i would never have used the .
neutral	now , weeks before my intended stay my credit_card has_been charged in full .
neutral	i had no_idea this would have happened ... but then i thought i was talking to the actual hotel reservation people .
neutral	i just hope i do not have to cancel .
neutral	i called the hotel that i am booked for and they explained how things work with this 0rd_party company and told me where to contact next time .
neutral	now , i no_issues with the service or the agent during the process .
neutral	he was polite , knowledgeable and very helpful .
neutral	i just did not know , nor was i told my card would be charged in full immediately .
neutral	i ordered my bike over the phone and it was completed within 0 minutes , my bike was delivered despite me requesting to pick it up but as this was their mistake i was not charged .
neutral	delivery was quick and the bike was well_packaged .
neutral	initially the bike was set_up correctly , however i noticed some noise coming from the bottom_bracket and the rear_wheel .
neutral	i tried to contact merlin about this but could not get through , therefore i took it to my local bike shop to be fixed .
neutral	we have
neutral	not had our holiday yet .
neutral	seems ok till you have a problem then you have to wait age '_s on the phone get though to somone in india waste of time then get cut_off
neutral	forced to pay for express shipping due to the item being too big , 0 . 0 pounds to be exact .
neutral	0 day shipping was actually 0 .
neutral	unfortunate , but i will still be back .
neutral	when i arrived at the tyre_centre workshop the technicians were talking amongst themselves and i as well as another customer were totally_ignored .
neutral	you at_least expect a friendly face and a welcome , and some idea as to how long i it was before the tyre change was carried_out .
neutral	i overheard someone say , “ why is it we always get customers at this time of day ( 0 . 00pm ) and just before we are about to close ?” perhaps the start of the england match against france had something to do with it !
neutral	apart_from that , the work carried_out was competent and efficient .
neutral	great trophie apart_from one off the base pads missing and had to pay another £ 0 . 00 at the post_office
neutral	nothing makes it more difficult to use your service then when i '_m trying to place an order late at night on the weekends , i spend a big chuck of time shifting through restaurants that " next delvery in 0 days " kinda thing .
neutral	this should be off by default .
neutral	also my locations should be a dropdown instead of a big open box that i have to type in a new address into .
neutral	well bought a replacement upper radiator house for my 0000 land_rover disc ii , the product said oem but upon_receiving i could tell right_away that it was not good quality very poor flimsy and thin , well you get what you pay for .
neutral	more for a learning experience , but i was sent the wrong squash_racket ( it appears to be labelled incorrectly on the bag ).
neutral	i was then sent postage to send the packet back , but the postage was uk stamps ( i was expecting some form of return to sender sticker - if they exist ), the uk stamps won_'_t work in guernsey , so i had to pay for it to be posted back anyway .
neutral	just fyi , if you deliver to the channel_islands , they have their own postage stamps .
neutral	otherwise i '_m happy with the attempts to fix the issue .
neutral	i '_ve no_complaints as i don_'_t believe it was your fault ( probably head '_s ) and you tried your best .
neutral	will still shop at pdh_sports .
neutral	i purchased a new 0 year license for bit_defender 0000 however one of my computers is running windows_xp 00 bit and your product said basically " sorry , your os is too old ".
neutral	my plan wasn_'_t to upgrade my antivirus and then have it tell me that it can '_t install on one of my computers .
neutral	i had been running bit_defender on that computer just fine until i upgraded .
neutral	now i have no antivirus on it .
neutral	little pissed_off about that .
neutral	over all great experience but wrong part quick delivery
neutral	need packing_material to prevent canned_cat_food from getting dented in transit ,
neutral	fedex couldnt find address on feb 00 said we were closed at 000 pm we were there til 000pm parts_geek good company but should use ups i wont order anything until they switch to ups .
neutral	i wanted a switch for a heatstore aqua esprit but could find no listing for it on shower_doctor .
neutral	i sent a request but they came back with a completely different one which i could see was wrong .
neutral	i had stumbled_upon a picture of the one i wanted under a different name in an earlier search so i ordered it and it looks just the ticket .
neutral	the moral is shower_doctors info is not_necessarily reliable .
neutral	very speedy_delivery .
neutral	efficient , had to change a different meet date , no problem .
neutral	have to wait and see how things actually turn out !
neutral	items got her in a timely_manner , and i like the look of the jeans , they just ran a little small .
neutral	i was told there is no current exchange policy and i would have to buy the jeans again in a larger_size .
neutral	return the small size and wait for a refund .
neutral	tons of hassle !!
neutral	and due to our extremely tight_budget i have to wait for a pay day ( and i only get paid once a month ) before i can buy jeans in the correct size and send off the off the small size to and wait for my refund .
neutral	if it wasn_'_t for the hassle i would of rated the jeans and the quickness of the shipment at a 0 until i seen how long the jeans lasted after a wash .
neutral	a little more_expensive than in stores , plus the shipping makes it almost too much for the service .
neutral	had a $_00 off coupon which is the reason i decided to buy from petflow . com .
neutral	probably would not purchase again without coupon .
neutral	on the plus side , website was very convenient , easy to use , and shipping was fast .
neutral	the bonsal catylic converter did not fit exactly to my 00 chevy suburban , i had to modify the flange bolt plate to make them thinner and the holes longer ,
neutral	i don_'_t like having paid for premium dog_food that arrives with it '_s air vacuum being broken .
neutral	there '_s no telling how fresh the product is .
neutral	i can pay a little more locally and be assured the vacuum_seal hasn_'_t been jeopardized .
neutral	i was contacted by the storage_facility , a few hours after making the reservation , to be told that the unit i had reserved was not available .
neutral	lucky for me the facility itself was very accommodating and the manager had some things moved around so that i would have a spot to store my boat .
neutral	my order was sent as a split shipment and only one part arrived .
neutral	contacting customer service became a bit of a nightmare as different people replied to my emails and replies giving differing and confusing information with a very rigid procedure to get what after all i had paid for but not received .
neutral	eventually , like 0_weeks_later , all was well but i think some thought needs to be given to this aspect .
neutral	i purchased a hood for a 0000 sunfire and it was quite dented when i got it .
neutral	fortunately , i got one of the dents out myself but the worst dent is up toward the corner by the windshield and i worked it out some but it is in an inconspicuous area so i won_'_t send the hood back .
neutral	too much hassle to ship it back .
neutral	when we initially made the reservation , the prices went up during the process .
neutral	then when we got to the counter the rental company didn_'_t have our reservation .
neutral	thankfully we had printed it up before we left , so they matched the rate .
neutral	we didn_'_t get the car we wanted however .
neutral	parts are fine , but the shipping could be improved .
neutral	hopeless tracking .
neutral	regular mail would be much_better .
neutral	collect from the hostel owners ; they usually make a lot of money packing up to 00 and 00 people into a room ; devise another charging model
neutral	my first purchase from global .
neutral	the sunglasses are excellent with heavier lenses than i will buy after the first experience .
neutral	the clear lens glasses are not ideal vision .
neutral	my eyes always have to adjust to this pair .
neutral	i am a man of many glasses , and this pair is not exactly right .
neutral	i will return as a customer .
neutral	i have been a long time zenni customer .
neutral	i prefer your selection .
neutral	construction quality is more rugged than zenni .
neutral	prices are higher .
neutral	most_likely its not ca '_s fault but there was a stain on my jacket that i ordered .
neutral	i guess they should have checked before sending , was very disappointed so now its sent back for an exchange , which currently is out of stock , hope they manage to get it to me asap .
neutral	apart_from that , the service is great , helpful and fast and got a free_gift !
neutral	quick love the woody smell of fresssssh smoked paprika
neutral	recent_purchases have been delayed , and the application was not correct .
neutral	i did not return the parts because the amount was smaller , but i need to have more faith in the search filters than i do now .
neutral	part delivered faster_than advertised .
neutral	at first i thought it was a good price , but once i found out the price of postage to return the core , i '_ll most_likely go local next time .
neutral	sorry partsgeek .
neutral	made my purchase as the item was marked as in stock with a next_day delivery time , entered all my payment , address & delivery details & completed the transaction only to be called 0 minutes later and told that unfortunately the item is in stock ... at the manufacturers in germany !!!
neutral	so delivery would be around 00 days .
neutral	was given the option to cancel , which i did and no payment was taken .
neutral	bit of a waste of my time but at_least they took no payment before calling me which i appreciated , but they shouldn_'_t say it '_s in stock if it '_s not !
neutral	!
neutral	although i got the goods i ordered they arrived in broken packaging .
neutral	it was only the delivery people who found it and put the contents together .
neutral	also , part of the packaging was wet so it had been left in the rain somewhere .
neutral	i understand mistakes_happen cause they also happen in my line of work to .
neutral	i '_m just a little unsatisfied with the mistake only because i was trying to get the custom taillights before a certain date .
neutral	the envelopes arrived very quickly , which was an excellent service .
neutral	i '_m not sure how the correct address was recorded .
neutral	i did send an e_-_mail about the address on the system being incorrect .
neutral	bonjour
neutral	j ' ai_eu seulelment le soucis de confirmation et suivie de_ma_commande car aucun numeros telephone et surtout que_je_n ' ai_eu aucun e_-_mail de_votre part ni au debut ni pendant ni à_la_livraison et c ' est inqiétant ça .
neutral	si non votre site de vente tres intéressant et avec_des bons prix .
neutral	merci ... bonne continuation .
neutral	i was trying something new , so it would have been nice to have dosage information with the package .
neutral	instead i had to go online to find the dosage .
neutral	i was very pleased with the site , the quality and of the products and the selection .
neutral	navigation wa simple and checkout was a breeze .
neutral	prices were very reasonable ,.
neutral	but shipping seemed high [ particularly in that the catheters i ordered weigh next to nothing .
neutral	there is a $_00 resort_fee paid upon check - in that you ' re not aware of upon booking or if it is listed , that is some very small_print !
neutral	overall it '_s a nice property , but i wasn_'_t very impressed with the hotel staff ...
neutral	i paid $_00 more to book a larger room with two beds .
neutral	when i arrived at the counter , they couldn_'_t find my booking .
neutral	i clarified that two beds were needed and provided them with my booking number ...
neutral	they eventually found it and provided us with our room .
neutral	their check out time is 00am so we requested a later one , but they said no because unfortunitley they had just given the last one out .
neutral	we got to our room and found one king_bed .
neutral	i called the front_desk and they said that we would need to contact travelocity to deal with it ...
neutral	i said that i would not be willing to do that so she said she would speak to her manager and call me back ... never got a call .
neutral	the best part of the hotel , are the restaurants on site - i highly_recommend timo .
neutral	it '_s a fantastic restaurant with unique dishes , excellent service , and a great atmosphere ... los abrigados resort and spa should take some tips from timo and improve their resort .
neutral	long_waits
neutral	flowers were okay , issues with the delivery
neutral	the samples do not show the correct result !
neutral	this is very objectionable in that it can give erroneous information !
neutral	tested also a bill only in water and it gave effect to the use of cocaine , amphetamines and pcp !
neutral	and it was in the water
neutral	sip provides great parts and excellent service .
neutral	however , if you are not in europe , you '_ll be forced to rely_on the website product descriptions to make a purchase decision .
neutral	( you can send an_email_asking for details , but there '_s a significant time lag and if your question is misinterpreted , then it takes that much longer to get a satisfactory answer .)
neutral	here is my wish_list for the website :
neutral	- provide exploded parts diagrams to help with installation and ordering .
neutral	- increase the font_size to make it easier to read and reduce the clutter
neutral	- have a native english speaker proof - read the part descriptions and remove abbreviations
neutral	- provide better illustrations for fork - disc_brake - shock conversions on vintage bikes .
neutral	( i had to crawl through separate catalog pages on each component to * guess * at how they all fit together .)
neutral	- clean up the ' alternative ' part recommendations .
neutral	' alternative ' can mean ' acceptable substitute ' in english , but to german - speakers , it seems to mean ' similar '.
neutral	so , there '_s no guarantee that ' alternative ' parts have the same form , fit or function .
neutral	i have used you a number of times but my chicken container was broke and the chicken was everywhere in the box
neutral	partsgeek has great prices , that '_s why i come_back , but they are less then lightening_fast when it comes to shipping your order .
neutral	i ordered on monday , they didn_'_t ship the part until friday and i didn_'_t get the part for a week .
neutral	a week i understand , but two ?
neutral	i could have paid the same price at amazon and got it faster .
neutral	for $ 0 bucks shipping on a timing_belt it shouldn_'_t take a week , but i was actually more disappointed with the 0 work days it took them to ship the part .
neutral	not shipsticks fault .
neutral	ups weather delay , so they say .
neutral	still disappointed , and out $_000 .
neutral	having had to rent clubs for two_days .
neutral	i did not have a problem with ink_farm '_s order processing or shipping , but when it comes to the product , there '_s where i start having a problem with this order .
neutral	my printer would not recognize one of the new ink_cartridges .
neutral	the other 0 colors installed perfectly with no issue , but the fifth cartridge would show as " low ink ".
neutral	i followed the very fine_print but no success , so much for following directions , i '_ll be looking else where for my replacement ink .
neutral	a great way of seeing many sights easily /.
neutral	was disappointed in the drive past of buckingham_palace , route only takes you around the side , so to see it you need to get off and walk around .
neutral	that plus the detour going north via hyde_park corner via the bus base at green_park took time .
neutral	so if we had realised or checked the map properly , we would have gone south and east from westminster rather_than north and west and caught the sights we really wanted to see without the distractions and the traffic jams in regent street
neutral	some of the order still_hasn_'_t arrived so not impressed so_far .
neutral	some of the order was sent which was in stock .... the rest which i was told would have been in a few_days ago still_hasn_'_t arrived .
neutral	costumes were really good , better quality than_expected .
neutral	only down_side was the skeleton tights ( up to 0ft0in ) didn_'_t fit my girlfriend , not even nearly .
neutral	get the feeling i got send the smaller_size although this wasn_'_t clear as the packaging didn_'_t say which size they were .
neutral	shipping is outrageous ...... all the " free " expired samples have punitive extra_charges tacked onto the shipping_costs for each and every one !!
neutral	!
neutral	i wish they would match free shipping like other_sites do but have to admit , i like the fact that they beat competitor prices by 0 %........ depending_on the weight of the product and how much you are buying , it makes_sense to order from this company .
neutral	another thing i do not like is they are non_- responsive to email questions or take_forever to get back to you
neutral	i would rate them a 0 . 0 / 00
neutral	only_negative is high shipping and handling cost , which makes them even with other_companies with higher supplement prices but lower shipping cost .
neutral	the item was delivered , however a piece was damaged .
neutral	the company were contacted , who asked for a photograph of the damaged piece .
neutral	this was e_- mailed to the company , who sent a replacement within 0 days .
neutral	as a criticism though , i had to pay for the whole unit to be returned .
neutral	this was only £ 0 . 00 , however i did feel i shouldn_'_t have to pay for something that was not my fault .
neutral	i expected to send only the damaged piece back , not the whole unit , or even for a replacement piece to be sent , not the whole unit .
neutral	i recently ordered some tweezer tongs that were " in stock " when i ordered them , and back ordered until mid june .
neutral	i will now be billed for a deprecate purchase when they ship , as well as additional_charges for shipping .
neutral	got just what i wanted except bi_- weekly payments are higher_than i wanted and it could have been smaller
neutral	he made me think that three options were not options by assuming me into these options .
neutral	i didn_'_t know they were options until i was signing the contract with his manager .
neutral	the manager informed me that my payment would be lower without them and that i could discontinue them if i wanted .
neutral	i was tired at that point and beat down so i signed .
neutral	i an seriously_considering seuing drive time for this misrepresentation
neutral	het hout is van goede_kwaliteit_en droog .
neutral	die 0 m0 gestapeld is wel nogal in het nadeel van_de klant gemeten .
neutral	als_je alles aan_de buitenkant van_de " verpakking en_het pallet " meet kom je wel in de buurt maar niet meer_dan dat .
neutral	i ordered an oil_filter wrench , as machine_mart had the best on - line selection of such tools .
neutral	but the express 00 - hour delivery service which cost me £ 0 extra failed completely .
neutral	i believe there were handover issues between parcel_force and royal_mail and it took 0 working days to reach me .
neutral	however mm did agree to refund the £ 0 charge .
neutral	have to wait and see how my problem is resolved concerning receiving a broken part and the holes for the sockets dont match up and it was supposed to come with bulbs and new harness and they were also missing
neutral	i was looking for muffler parts .
neutral	i found those that i needed but the gasket offerings were numerous and not clear ( to me ) as which would be appropriate .
neutral	my support_ticket was #_000000 .
neutral	after a week of no response i made a " guess " on those that i needed .
neutral	i hope that i guessed right as installation happens this weekend .
neutral	as for order tracking , of course my parts ( order # 00 - 0000000 ) came from two warehouses , so double the shipping_charges .
neutral	ok , i can understand that .
neutral	however , one of the tracking_numbers provided to me linked into fedex , but it turned_out to be a ups_tracking_number , so i was given the correct number but to the wrong carrier .
neutral	( it took a bit of investigation to discover this , added by the apprehension that the parts from this warehouse arrived on different days - something that i never expected ).
neutral	you seem to have got some kind of new downloader on some games , and it doesn_'_t work properly .
neutral	i '_ve tried several_times with 0 games ( bioshock 0 and tom clancy '_s ghost recon future soldier deluxe ) and it keeps beeing at 0 % and ( 0 of 0 ) or something like it .
neutral	please fix it , because it is really annoying !
neutral	sporting_events tickets should have the original cost of the ticket listed next to what they are charging .
neutral	yankees vs . royals section 000 row c , original cost $_00 . 00 per ticket .
neutral	their charges , $_00 . 00 a ticket = 000 . 00
neutral	service fees , = 00 . 00
neutral	shipping , = 00 . 00 shipping across the state from lenexa ks , to abilene ks , by way of memphis tn , back to wichita ks .
neutral	really a $_000 + cell_phone from china doesnt cost that much to ship based on the weight of the package .
neutral	total = 000 . 00
neutral	and where do these service fees come into play , didnt you get enough $ when you doubled the ticket price ?
neutral	it sure is messed_up you can '_t leave_feedback on their site unless it was hotel related .
neutral	part was a copy from china and hard to install and immediately had problems .
neutral	this was a taillight ass .
neutral	and should have been a simpler plug and go .
neutral	it was cheep so as they say i got what i paid for .
neutral	whilst the prices seem keen , the tonners after the first order the box changed and so did the length they last ?
neutral	considering going back to other supplier .
neutral	pretty good phone service .
neutral	the web_site was a bit flakey .
neutral	i was using google_voice with my obitalk portal up until recently .
neutral	google_voice had no cost for using their services , but recently ended their support for the obitalk boxes .
neutral	so i switched to phone_power .
neutral	the cost is minimal , like around $_00 a year , which is great ... but the quality of this service is poor , especially when compared to google '_s support .
neutral	my phone_calls are constantly dropped , the quality is poor and people to whom i am talking cannot hear me clearly .
neutral	often i have to hang_up and call them back .
neutral	sometimes that doesn_'_t even help .
neutral	many_times i end up talking on my cell_phone because i need to have a clear and reliable connection .
neutral	i am truly disappointed with the quality of the service and will be looking for other options .
neutral	honestly , though , i ' d pay twice what i '_m paying now if i could just be guaranteed reliable service .
neutral	i hope they can resolve these issues quickly .
neutral	i am still resolving an issue with a part that arrived damaged .
neutral	the part had not been properly packed for shipping and arrived damaged .
neutral	the company responded to a return request in a timely_manner and sent a return_label with instructions .
neutral	i am still in the process of returning the item for refund & replacement therefore i cannot completely review the company at this point .
neutral	tried for a week to get someone on the phone , no return calls or e_-_mails !
neutral	could not check with anyone on help with ordering !
neutral	cost was good but shipping was too high in cost !
neutral	shipping was too slow !
neutral	was told shipping was high because part was long , when i got the part it was folded 0 times ????
neutral	part fit was fair at best and no hardware at all to install the new part .
neutral	had to end up going to the dealer for small parts as all the part stores stuff didn_'_t fit , too sm or too big ( same old story ).
neutral	some holes no line - up etc .
neutral	fit over all not as good as factory .
neutral	heatgun , clamps , razorknife and time one could make the part work better_than it comes .
neutral	the plastic capsules do not puncture as well as the nespresso capsule material .
neutral	this results in slower fill and some capsules not working at all .
neutral	coffee is good , not great .
neutral	it was a good service and oil was delivered in about 0 days which was good , but i have subsequently found cheaper suppliers so unlikely i would use again .
neutral	the group discount option gave_me a £ 0 discount on a £_000 order , which is totally pointless really , of course they don_'_t tell you what discount you get before you sign_up .
neutral	shop around would be my advice ...
neutral	purchased an amp that was in - stock , and qualified for next_day delivery .
neutral	ordered well before cut - off time .
neutral	didn_'_t get next_day delivery .
neutral	had to ensure i was at home for a second consecutive day .
neutral	thats annoying - people have to work !
neutral	!
neutral	online tracking is sluggish and doesn_'_t update tracking data until after you gave received the goods - that '_s not great either .
neutral	product was fine though and at a good price , chap i spoke to after chasing was also good .
neutral	see opinion above as it states the very noisy background .
neutral	these telepeople need the professional curuosty of a cube that is noise proof .
neutral	i could hear the teleperson ( s ) next to him .
neutral	he was great and very professional .
neutral	i don_'_t know how they can stand the background_noise .
neutral	best way to find out about your service is to call them as if you were a customer .
neutral	we take big_bus_tours in many of the cities where they are offered and i am afraid this one disappointed in several ways .
neutral	taking the issues chronologically , we got off to a late 00 : 00 start on the day we decided to ride and therefore wanted to book the two day pass .
neutral	when booking on the same day as the intended bus ride , the online discount is lost .
neutral	my family of four still wanted to go , however , so i attempted to sign_up for the two day pass .
neutral	during the payment process , the invoicing switched to one day and i did not notice it ( in fact not until the following_day when we were planning to board ) and the website booked only a one day pass for the four of us .
neutral	the audio materials were not as informative as we would have hoped and seemed interminable .
neutral	my children stopped trying to listen long before the end of the tour .
neutral	we also made the mistake of taking the loop b bus because it picked_up close to where we were staying .
neutral	five and a half hours_later and eight long stops shy of where we started , the bus driver told us they were quitting for the evening .
neutral	we had never exited the bus and did not even manage one pass around loop b .
neutral	the driver did offer to permit us to remain in the bus for the purpose of returning to our original stop , but only if we waited for passengers from other similarly situated buses to board our bus .
neutral	we just gave up , left and took a cab home instead .
neutral	shame they couldn_'_t pick_up the phone to clarify my address and i had to go hunting the package down 000 metres up the road .
neutral	otherwise good service .
neutral	i did not return the core because it cost more to return ship the core than the core rebate was .
neutral	this was very disappointing , and may preclude me from using partsgeek in the future for such purchases .
neutral	huge_selection of parts and good prices but at a pretty big cost ... partsgeek customer service is essentially non_- existent .
neutral	make_sure you order the correct part because , as stated in the fine_print , the return shipping is on the customer (" regardless of the party at fault .")
neutral	partsgeek cuts corners to save you money which can be good or bad depending_on youryour circumstances .
neutral	if these_guys could actually get together a halfway decent customer service department , there '_s no_doubt in my mind they would become the # 0 parts supplier in the us .
neutral	fina blommor , men dyrt och inte riktigt så snabbt_och tillgängligt som_man_kan önska .
neutral	ingen leverans på söndagar är under all kritik .
neutral	en verksamhet som denna ska leverera när som_helst för det priset .
neutral	i have not received my receipt for the purchase .
neutral	this was made with a company expense account and i have to turn in all paperwork .
neutral	please forward the receipt to my e_-_mail address .
neutral	this was my first order from your web_site .
neutral	i realize the machine i was trying to find parts for might be difficult .
neutral	the image i ordered the parts from was not the same as the parts i received .
neutral	after a phone_call to your site , i was advised some alterations would need to be made for these parts to fit_properly .
neutral	i will do this to make the parts work , but i was some what disappointed .
neutral	perhaps due to the period ( spring_break ), added to an intense work of constructing a new office , we experienced a certain chaos in collecting the tickets and getting on the buses .
neutral	the guides , however , were kind and professional , trying to control the situation as fair as possible .
neutral	first of all , there were some glitches with the site flow during the ordering_process .
neutral	i contacted the company about this , no response .
neutral	i added items to cart , went to check out , was prompted to enter all new info to create an account , which is normal and expected .
neutral	but then was sent back to the home page or an empty cart ( i forget precisely ).
neutral	upon adding items again and checking out , i was likewise sent through the same loop , prompted to create an account , which is not being handled properly .
neutral	i had to manually go back to home page , create the account first , and only then was i able to successfully proceed through the checkout .
neutral	i have coded web sites and ecommerce sites in the past .
neutral	bugs happen in development , i get that .
neutral	but that '_s why you do testing , and that '_s why you fix them , usually and preferably before putting a code into live production .
neutral	but att he very least , fixed within a short time after you receive your first complaint , at_least within a week , preferably same day within a few hours , even if it means you stay late through half the night to get it done right !
neutral	secondly , the processing took about 0 days , which is a little too_long .
neutral	processing of cc data should occur within the first 00_hours , usually done in a batch job at night to reduce payment processing costs .
neutral	i used to work on ecommerce sites with custom shopping carts that integrated with numerous payment processors , at an internet company that itself sold services online .
neutral	it was a small company , less_than 00 employees in it '_s entire history .
neutral	no excuse for taking 0 days , unless injury , illness , natural disaster , etc .
neutral	likewise , there was no response from customer service .
neutral	to be fair , i later realized that i typoed my phone_number by one digit , so i don_'_t know if that would cause a cc slowdown , but i was never contacted about any_problems or clarification .
neutral	thirdly , i ordered two different tubes of tom '_s of maine toothpaste , advertised as 0 oz tubes .
neutral	i was given a dhl tracking_number , which dhl never recognized .
neutral	i tried plugging the tracking_number into fedex or usps but likewise not recognized .
neutral	the package arrived roughly within the estimated time frame , at the end of the window .
neutral	i do remember the days when we did not have tracking_numbers .
neutral	but nowadays , it eases the customer '_s mind to see the package is in carrier '_s hands and making steady progress , or even to go online and divert packages if there '_s an anticipated delivery problem , like not being there to receive , etc .
neutral	fourth ( ly ?
neutral	), when i first picked_up the box , it rattled , because the items were placed in a box 0x bigger than the tubes of toothpaste with no packing_material .
neutral	so the boxes had been moving around a lot .
neutral	when i opened the box , the tubes were half out of their individual boxes .
neutral	you need packing_material for two reasons !
neutral	prevent the items from moving , causing damage , but also to strengthen the box against impacts .
neutral	if the box is compromised , then catastrophic failure can occur , and there go your items all over the place .
neutral	finally , when i looked at the toothpaste , they were the flavors that i ordered , but were 0 . 0oz .
neutral	the site also advertised 0 . 0oz , but what i ordered said 0oz , and that is what i used to calculate cost per ounce , when comparing prices .
neutral	if the box says 0 . 0oz , and you can type in 0 . 0oz then there '_s no excuse for false_advertising .
neutral	even the pothek inventory sticker on the box says 0oz , so may indicate an inventory process that needs correcting .
neutral	these tubes come in a few different_sizes .
neutral	advertising correct and accurate size , not rounding off when it '_s such a small_quantity to begin with , is important .
neutral	maybe the toothpaste company doesn_'_t even make a 0oz , which is why i thought it odd .
neutral	anyways , 0 . 0 / 0 . 0 is 00 . 0 % hence the title of this review .
neutral	edited this review several_times to include as much detail and as accurately as possible , in the hopes of helping this company recognize areas for improvement .
neutral	i want to believe they are decent , hard working americans , making an honest living , and striving to provide value and service to us all .
neutral	i respect that , and want to see them succeed !
neutral	they ' re maybe a relatively new company , and have some growing pains to go through .
neutral	they have all the elements for success right at their fingertips , and they are so close , i can feel it .
neutral	they just need to ensure they hire a few key individuals willing to go above and beyond the call of duty to get things running_smoothly .
neutral	then they will be golden .
neutral	the business model is sound .
neutral	there '_s no shortage of people showing up , interested in products , and ready to remain loyal .
neutral	they just need to polish the execution , make things right with customer complaints , develop a more positive response , gain back the trust and confidence in the customer base by consistently staying on top of problem areas , making changes more quickly to adapt business processes as needed .
neutral	i truly wish them the best of luck , and willing to give more chances .
neutral	twice_now , my account has_been inaccessible when i sign on telling_me my sign - on failed .
neutral	why does this happen ?
neutral	just last_week , for the second time , i received a quarterly update in my personal email , tried to sign into my account to view it , and was unable to get into it because it wouldn_'_t recognize me .
neutral	this is very frustrating and unacceptable .
neutral	please keep this from happening because if i experience this again , i will terminate my service and go to a competitor .
neutral	never calledvme as_promised the following_day with an update on tires i was looking for
neutral	hotel was about 00_minutes from hotel .
neutral	booked room for 0 people only 0 food vouchers were given .
neutral	room wasn_'_t the cleanest .
neutral	i had to wait over 00 days for my order .
neutral	they were all christmas cd '_s .
neutral	when i called to find out what the delay was , the lady on the phone said that they were waiting for a cd that was on my order to come in .
neutral	i think they either should of let_me know that via an e_-_mail or shipped what they could of the order and the last cd separately .
neutral	i had no communication from them .
neutral	one last thing - three of the cases on the cd '_s were broken and i had to replace them .
neutral	the low_prices that oldies . com does have are negated when i have to replace the jewel cases on the cd '_s .
neutral	poor packing on my shipment .
neutral	i got everything in my order but , i ordered two brake sencors and only got the one for the front_brake .
neutral	i hope the old one on the rear can be reused . other than than that little " hick - up " all went well .
neutral	i would use them again and would recommend to a friend . just be sure of what you order .
neutral	ordered pants , black , white & blue , got 0 white & blue
neutral	you can sometimes get really great bargains on zavvi , but other items are really overpriced when compared to competitors .
neutral	the postage on my last item was a couple of days longer_than i used to get with zavvi so i '_m still swayed to their competitors first .
neutral	replacement electric toooth brush_heads
neutral	first time i have ordered these .
neutral	they are a good copy but for one small problem .
neutral	they do not fit & clic into place on toothbrush stem .
neutral	so therefore if not careful when brushing head comes off in mouth & toothbrush stem can stab you in the face .
neutral	i would not let children use these as i would be afraid that they would hurt themselves or stab themselves in the eye with the metal stem .
neutral	i am considering returning these as i bought 00 !
neutral	that was extremely annoying .
neutral	i probably_won_'_t use travelocity anymore because of that .
neutral	this was a more challenging purchase than i expected .
neutral	i ordered a box of 00 humidifier pads and was initially shipped a single pad .
neutral	after working pretty hard to communicate with ecomfort , they made another shipment -- but only 0 more pads .
neutral	i called again , and they finally shipped the remaining three pads .
neutral	these_folks are an honest business because they eventually completed the order .
neutral	however , my " message " to them is that they are spending way too much money on their shipping_costs .
neutral	they do not seem to have good control ( or linkage with their on - line sales ) of their inventory levels .
neutral	so , bottom_line : they did deliver , but it was way too problematic .
neutral	i ordered a single 0 dollar key through paypal , but the autokey_system said that it was awaiting payment .
neutral	being such a small_amount , i figured i would just submit a ticket and hope for the best .
neutral	it worked out and when i woke_up in the morning the problem had been resolved and i just had to complete an easy phone_verification by sms .
neutral	satisfied , but will likely keep any future_purchases from cjs at a lower price than i might from a more prominent store such as amazon or steam .
neutral	i was annoyed at having been out 0 bucks for the time being , but pleasantly_surprised to find that i could actually receive it .
neutral	had it been a higher cost .... well that might have been a different story .
neutral	had to purchase a diving mask with prescription_lenses at very short_notice as was going on diving trip in a couple of days .
neutral	quick phone_call , lenses and mask were both in stock and mask with prescription_lenses fitted was ordered and delivered the next_day .
neutral	unfortunately they had reversed the prescriptions for each eye and consequently put the wrong lenses in .
neutral	flying the next_morning so too_late to change .
neutral	this meant that i could not use the mask on the holiday .
neutral	various telephone_calls and emails ensued .
neutral	a new mask with the correct lenses was sent out later that next week but too_late to use on my dive trip .
neutral	their customer_services '_s attitude was very professional , customer_focused and reacted very quickly .
neutral	it is a shame that the warehouse staff didn_'_t have the same level of service and attention to ensure that the correct lenses were fitted .
neutral	would recommend and deal with again despite this hiccup .

neutral	lad os håbe den gode stil forsætter ....
neutral	i picked_up my car in rome off airport on a local street .
neutral	service was excellent and the car was great .
neutral	it was exactly_what i had hoped for .
neutral	the agent provided excellent directions out of town but i was not provided directions back to the ultimate drop_off point at termini station .
neutral	the car operated perfectly .
neutral	i was able to drive through rome and throughout southern italy without issue .
neutral	everything_went well except returning at termini .
neutral	in addition to the standard rome confusion driving around termini , there were no signs at all for rental_car return .
neutral	after driving around termini 0 times we stopped and found a vendor who was able to research the answer .
neutral	the rental return is located on the 0th or 0th_floor of a public parking garage in a difficult location to find .
neutral	in addition , turns in the garage are so tight it makes for a difficult time returning a car larger than a mini .
neutral	so - my suggestion to improve this experience is to improve signage for rental_car return at termini and if there is ever an opportunity to find a larger parking garage for rental return , please consider .
neutral	as always , keeping the price as low as possible is always primary .
neutral	thank_you for a good car and good customer service .
neutral	very high cost for product including shipping .
neutral	received on time .
neutral	if all goes well with your order then you have nothing to worry_about .
neutral	i have had a few issues with orders in the past that have not been so smooth , but have been resolved in a reasonable time frame .
neutral	if you find yourself with more than one account with them and want to merge these into a single one , be warned .
neutral	the points you earn are not transferable !
neutral	their support area was fairly blunt in the inability for them to take point from one account and put them in another - even if they are registered to the same individual .
neutral	i don_'_t know why the bookings are not dynamic , click and book same as for booking a hotel .
neutral	the time delays waiting for requests is a joke in a modern age .
neutral	before handing my car key over to the chaffeur , he confirmed that my car will be parked at a secure carpark no more that 0 miles .
neutral	i recorded the mileage and on my return i discovered that in fact a total of 00 miles were clocked on my car !!
neutral	watch out !
neutral	we were pleased to find nespresso_capsules for a lower price and placed an order right_away .
neutral	the shipping was fast and the coffee is good ... but we find the capsules are not completely compatible with the nespresso_machine .
neutral	they fit very snuggly and it is hard to raise the level to eject the capsule after brewing .
neutral	i thought we might break the arm , at one point .
neutral	we are not sure the bad fit is worth the price reduction .
neutral	you save a buck and get zero support and low quality merchandise .
neutral	now , they are doing away with all of the neat little departments like sewing and replacing them with throwaways .
neutral	i understand that their pharmacy is reasonable and reliable .
neutral	i buy a few things there , but lately i leave a lot more often without making a single purchase .
neutral	they were a good department store in the beginning .
neutral	today , you just can '_t find what they used to carry .
neutral	they are doing too poor a job at trying to be " every " business , instead of being good at something .
neutral	ah well , maybe it '_s time we took another look at buying local from the small mom & pop stores .
neutral	what goes around , comes around .
neutral	just not very intuitive .
neutral	i guess it '_s not fair to compare it to quality products like photoshop , but it '_s natural .
neutral	when you get used to working with programs that flow smoothly , anything_else is a big disappointment .
neutral	i booked a room and found that the cost charged to my card was twice what i had seen on bookit .
neutral	when i checked the finer print i found a tiny note_saying the price that was advertised in big red numbers was actually per person - which i have never_heard of and did not see during the process of booking .
neutral	disappointing :(
neutral	fast delivery but an annoying activation charge that i wouldn_'_t get from a store .
neutral	the car_rental process was smooth , however returning the car was a major disappointment with europcar .
neutral	we returned the car maybe 00_minutes after the scheduled time .
neutral	we knew that we needed to put maybe $_00 of gas in the car , but rome was crazy to drive in and we preferred to just have europcar fill the tank for us .
neutral	they explained the triple - the - normal - per - liter price , plus a 00 euro convenience fee .
neutral	they recommended that we refill at a nearby gas_station .
neutral	we did , thus_making our official return time " longer "... and the gas_station machine malfunctioned and couldn_'_t return us the 00 euros that we were owed ( used a 00 euro bill ).
neutral	we received a receipt with a refund amount and were told to see the gas_station attendant , who of course had diseappeared for hours .
neutral	we explained this to the car_rental_agency , that was located about a 0 minute_walk_away from the gas_station and the nice rental agent wanted to credit us the 00 euros and then collect the refund later himself at the gas_station .
neutral	his_boss , in italian ( thinking we couldn_'_t understand ) told_him over and over again that he wouldn_'_t do that if it were him .
neutral	in the end , we were charged a full extra day rental , plus all of the normal fees , plus lost 00 euros ... so overall we lost about $_000 that day .
neutral	it just ended_up making the experience bad overall .
neutral	the sales agent could have told us that we were being charged an extra day ... but did not .
neutral	i have bought several items from from you mcm and up until my two last purchases i was satisfied .
neutral	the last two items were some pro pyle 00 " sub woofers .
neutral	i finally got a chance to test them out to see how they would work .
neutral	my first obsevation when pulling them out of the box is that they were no carpeted .
neutral	on the web_site it clearly_states that they are carpeted speakers .
neutral	then when i hooked them up to hear them i clearly notice right_away a rattling sound which came from the plastic handles and the plastic adapter on top used to mount another speaker to it .
neutral	i removed the handles to see what was going on and discoverd the they were two piece construction and very flimsy plastic .
neutral	i just think that for a speaker that is close to 000 . 00 you would have better materials of construction .
neutral	now i have to buy four handles and two adapters to replace the cheap ones that came with the speakers .
neutral	or maybe see if you can trade me these plastic ones with some of the steel ones you sell .
neutral	no packing_slip .
neutral	item was a return to a company other than this .
neutral	mirror , passenger_side , was for different model that had heated_mirror .
neutral	electrical_plug did not match .
neutral	had to cut both and install connection plug from old mirror .
neutral	tempi_di_consegna speravo più veloci ma comunque tutto sommato ho risparmiato un bel pò di soldi .. in generale soddisfatto !

neutral	just got back from using manchester payless .
neutral	this is my third experience and could be my last .
neutral	when we arrived to drop the car off the door was locked .
neutral	there was one guy running the whole business from a cell_phone .
neutral	he did show up pretty quickly and was courteous enough so we were off on time .
neutral	since manchester had a snow_storm while we were away , i knew they would be busy digging out .
neutral	i was not scheduled back for several days after the storm so expected them to have caught up .
neutral	on our return day manchester was again getting snow and southwest stranded us in baltimore .
neutral	i was careful to call them as soon as i knew this was happening so they would know we would be a day late .
neutral	again the phone was answered on a cell_phone by someone multi_- tasking .
neutral	one more call the next_morning to give them an exact arrival time got the same cell_phone answer .
neutral	when we arrived and called , the attendee said it would be about 00_minutes while they got our car ready to go .
neutral	we waited close to 00_minutes only to get there and find no one else around - the door locked with the key in the hands of the driver - and our car still covered with the previous nights snow .
neutral	not impressed at all .
neutral	to his credit the driver was apologetic and courteous and explained how busy they had been .
neutral	ti is clear this place is understaffed and trying to operate on a shoestring .
neutral	we would like very much to assess your service , but we received no notification of the delivery . if they were delivered then please verify - then we can assess your service .
neutral	thank_you .
neutral	mr g sayce .
neutral	i rather you charge me the entire thing .
neutral	i received all of the parts i ordered , and they were all the correct parts ordered with no_problems .
neutral	there was a minor problem with a passenger_side headlight .
neutral	it arrived with a broken mounting_bracket and screw , but i was able to salvage one off of the old part .
neutral	otherwise , the broken bracket would have been a problem .
neutral	beware of paying extra shipping_costs thinking you ' re going to get all the parts overnight .
neutral	i paid quite a bit extra for overnight , and the parts i really needed didn_'_t arrive until 0 days_later .
neutral	their " customer service " is lousy because you can '_t call anyone , it all has to be done via_email .
neutral	when i complained , i was told that i was informed that my order would be delivered in separate_orders , and that i agreed !
neutral	if so , i sure didn_'_t understand that from the order confirmation .
neutral	other than the shipping issues ( which they did not refund my money for ), the parts i ordered were correct and of good quality .
neutral	when i paid for golf_trolley it stated on site that it was in stock , 0 days_later i emailed and was told they had to order it in , was advertise something in stock when it is not ?
neutral	?
neutral	hi ,
neutral	good site , nice products and good communication but your delivery partner dpd is awful .
neutral	i have received an_email from yourselves to say my next_day delivery would be with me on the 0th_jan as the product was collected from you on the 0rd .
neutral	i have ensure that someone would be ok to sign for it today and yet when i check the dpd tracking it only says it has_been collected and hasn_'_t gone any further through the process .
neutral	all parcels that are next_day delivery but delivered by dpd never arrive the next_day .
neutral	they are awful , get_rid .
neutral	other the that , carry on .
neutral	ross
neutral	while reviewing my purchase before it was shipped i discover two items on my invoice are not for my car instead of a voice on the phone i recieved email instructions of how to return an item .
neutral	with a person on the phone the return shipping procedure could be eliminated
neutral	when i call with a problem with the site , the customer reps are so used to hearing about bugs they simply advise me to log out and try again .
neutral	every time .
neutral	good price but i have been waiting over a week for my part to arrive
neutral	ordered wipers for my van ; front pair was fine , trunk wiper said ' no adapter ' was needed '.
neutral	wrong !
neutral	found and ordered the part online - easy .
neutral	arrived in few_days - great .
neutral	went to install and found the 0 mounting_holes do not align with the old mirror .
neutral	old mirror had three studs with the bottom 0 studs 0 0 / 0 " apart .
neutral	the new parts bottom holes were 0 0 / 0 " apart .
neutral	i say holes because the new part does use studs , it uses sheet_metal screws .
neutral	also , the top and front alignment stud was off .
neutral	had to use a rotary rasp trim out part of the door frame , drill out to 0 / 0 " inch the alignment stud holes , and drill a new hole for the forward mounting point .
neutral	always love a saturday project , but this was a bit more time involved for something advertised as a replacement part .
neutral	delivery wasn_'_t bad , guys were fast .
neutral	the only issue i have is the futon was " so - so " at best .
neutral	if you sit in one spot for more than 00_mins it feels_like the cushion is going to fall out the bottom .
neutral	for the money i expected a lot better futon .
neutral	provide other shipping options or faster ground shipment
neutral	fantastic product but still_waiting for rest of my order ?
neutral	good product well informed on status of shipment
neutral	the coffee is great .
neutral	the seal does not look as " bubble tight " as nespresso ( there are little wrinkles in the foil on the bottom of the capsule ), but i doubt that makes much difference .
neutral	my only real concern is that when you put the capsules into the machine and then turn the handle to the right it barely moves ... the capsules are just extremely snug .
neutral	coffee is fine and i don_'_t think they will damage the machine , but they don_'_t seem to be an exact_fit .
neutral	not sure if the product i received was real or not but the glasses arms sometimes split from the plastic !
neutral	ordered oakley_sunglasses on friday and paid £ 0 . 00 for next_day delivery , the item was marked as ' in stock '.
neutral	hadn_'_t arrived by tuesday , checked ups_tracking which said ' out for delivery by end of day '.
neutral	nothing arrived .
neutral	on wed_morning emailed blackleaf cust services .
neutral	they replied_saying that the sunglasses ordered were out of stock and would not be available for another 0 - 00 days .
neutral	they said that as they could not fulfil the order they would send me a full_refund .
neutral	sunglasses arrived on wednesday_afternoon !
neutral	i purchased a front_grill for a 0000_toyota_corolla which got damaged in a minor accident recently .
neutral	the ordering_process was simple and the price was very good .
neutral	when i received the product however , i discovered that it was shipped in a box that was too large and the packing_materials did not keep it from bouncing_around inside the box .
neutral	i also discovered that one of the corners of the grill had been broken off in shipping .
neutral	i assume that it was during shipping since it was still inside the plastic_wrap .
neutral	i chose to repair it with epoxy and fiberglass since that was easier than trying to get a replacement so i do not know well they would respond to a damaged product claim .
neutral	i like the value of the discounts but sometimes a seat will be in a less desirable area or picking_up tickets is in the back of the venue ( ballpark ).
neutral	so it really depends on the event and the venue .
neutral	i bought a complete exhaust_system that was supposed to be a direct fit for my truck .
neutral	the y pipe that had the catalytic_converters attached to it would not fit up under my truck no matter_how you twisted or turned it .
neutral	i had to end up cutting the new pipe in half and installing a coupling in it .
neutral	my tailpipe also had a hanger welded in the wrong position so i had to cut that off and install a new hanger .
neutral	overall the system works and sounds great but it was by no means a direct replacement .
neutral	price was ok delivered on time no_problems .
neutral	but was clobbered with a surcharge which i did not know about until i paid , this put oil more_expensive than other_companies
neutral	ordered item on a saturday but unfortunately 0 days_later i was informed that it was , out of stock and , on back order .
neutral	i still don_'_t know whether i will receive said item
neutral	found that the service did not run as often as it was claimed to do
neutral	long_waits 00 to 00_minutes sometimes
neutral	didnt seem to see all attractions ie museums and albert hall area
neutral	i ordered an air_filter for a 0000_chevy express that came in it '_s own shippable cardboard_box but then partsgeek , i presume , put it in an even bigger box which i believe made it even more_expensive to ship .
neutral	why ?
neutral	was this to get more money for shipping ?
neutral	the initial cost of the item was lower_than my parts store but it was about even after the shipping was added .
neutral	the empty space in the bigger box was filled with paper so the air_filter box wouldn_'_t shift position during shipment i guess .
neutral	i was a bit_apprehensive_about ordering from partsgeek , after_reading so many negative_reviews online , especially regarding their returns process .
neutral	however , i decided to give them a try .
neutral	i ordered a dorman climate_control_panel , which came with an outrageous core_charge of $_000 !
neutral	i was surprised at how quickly the part arrived .
neutral	after opening the package , i discovered that the part really wasn_'_t " remanufactured " as stated , rather it was a very used part that had new bulbs installed .
neutral	no updates to the aesthetic portions of the part , such as the faceplate .
neutral	not_necessarily partsgeek fault as much as it is dorman '_s .
neutral	that being said , the part worked and solved my problem .
neutral	the real issue came when i went to return the core .
neutral	i sent it usps so it arrived back at the partsgeek facility early in the day on a wednesday .
neutral	i did not receive a refund until late in the following week .
neutral	that turn_around time seemed excessive .
neutral	all in all , i think you get what you pay for .
neutral	i would order from them again , and have already , but not for anything that has a core_charge associated with it .
neutral	also , there is no real way to contact them ( i . e .
neutral	phone or email ).
neutral	you must submit a new support_ticket each and every time you have a simple question .
neutral	seems like a poor way to run a business to me , but it must be working because they seem to be doing well !
neutral	difficult to operate and did not recognise paypal_account yesterday but fine today .
neutral	every year i goto kwikfit ie every 0months normaly no_probs but this time the man said l need a new battery but every year thay say that the day after full service the car had truble starting so l thought i must need new battery had a look under bonnet and air box not connected so l clipped it back on car started well better so the car was cut_off of air but for a few month now when i put heater on it smelt funny so i put the dile to circulate in car doing my oil check today and see the air_filter box not screwed down so all the car fumes in engine bay getting sucked in got a screw_driver done it myself put me off kwikfit a bit now as l say allways go there but may think_twice_now
neutral	glasses arrived quickly but the frames were bent and the lenses were mis_- drilled to accommodate the bend .
neutral	prescription was correct but the lenses were not " transitions " as ordered .
neutral	they were very helpful in helping_me to return the glasses for evaluation , sending a usps shipping_label .
neutral	i am waiting on confirmation that they were received and what actions they will take .
neutral	these are not the first glasses i have ordered from frames . com , and i have been happy with them in the past .
neutral	transactions went well .
neutral	i ordered a scooter and a helmet .
neutral	when i received the helmet , it was the wrong one .
neutral	it was the same brand , but a different model than what was listed on the website .
neutral	i was told that sometimes designs change and they couldn_'_t control that .
neutral	when you order off the internet , you are going 000_% by the picture .
neutral	i ordered the street model which was a multi_- color helmet and received the solid color helmet .
neutral	i was told that i could ship it back , but would be responsible for the shipping , and they were doing me a favor because they weren_'_t charing me a restocking_fee !
neutral	that makes no sense when i didn_'_t receive what i ordered .
neutral	i can '_t believe a business wouldn_'_t want to make it right for the $_00 it cost me to send it back .
neutral	if they were ordering from someone_else , they would expect the same thing .
neutral	my scooter also got lost in shipment , which i realize is not killer_motorsports fault , and a new one was sent as soon as i called to inquire why it was missing .
neutral	i do question why it was a week_later and no one notified anyone that the shipment was lost a week after it was suppose to be delivered .
neutral	i was out of the country and didn_'_t find out it was missing until i returned
neutral	tomorrow i am sending back the part that was sent to me as the person that picked the item of the shelf , picked the incorrect part number .
neutral	the couches i received are great .
neutral	what is most unfortunate is the customer service .
neutral	it took nearly 00 weeks to received the furniture when it was noted to take 0 - 0_weeks .
neutral	when i emailed and called about it , the multiple people i asked , didn_'_t have much information for me .
neutral	the last email i sent didn_'_t even get a response .
neutral	then suddenly , the shipping company finally contacted me for the delivery , but sofas and sectionals didn_'_t even reply .
neutral	while i am relieved the furniture arrived to my satisfaction , it makes me nervous to make future_purchases as i wouldn_'_t want anyone to deal with customer service as i had .
neutral	it doesn_'_t create much trust with the company .
neutral	some improvement would be to better handle customers with inquires about the progress on furniture .
neutral	people don_'_t mind waiting a bit_longer if the furniture is taking longer_than_expected if the customer isn_'_t ignored .
neutral	you need to keep them in the loop .
neutral	garden best buys presented the best value for what we were looking for .
neutral	however after 0 working days waiting for delivery i had to chase them .
neutral	one friendly conversation later and the good arrived the next_day .
neutral	they had a problem with delivery from their supplier .
neutral	had they taken the time to contact me explaining why they were late i would have given them 0 or 0_stars .
neutral	they said they had them in stock when in fact they didn_'_t and the shipping is very slow .
neutral	i am happy that partsgeek had the correct parts , fuel tanks , for my truck but i did not order them on line .
neutral	i called to ensure i got the correct parts .
neutral	i told the partsgeek representative i had a 0000_ford_f000 diesel " short bed " 0wd .
neutral	they sent me the correct rear tank but the side tank they sent me was for a " long " long bed " truck so i had to order the correct one .
neutral	i did this on line and at the same time started the process to receive the rma_number to send back the incorrect one .
neutral	once i received the rma_number and boxed the incorrect tank up i proceeded to a fedex location were i found it was going to cost me almost as much as the tank did to ship it back !
neutral	and it was there fault since i called and they picked out the tanks for me !
neutral	ordered two exterior parts for bmw_000i ...
neutral	the light_bulb worked_fine but the wiper_blade replacement did not fit .
neutral	parts arrived on time .
neutral	the bmw part i wanted was expensive from the main dealers and the british auction_sites were also expensive compared to the foreign ones .
neutral	so i tried 0st choice , i quickly got a quote ( great ), which was high but at_least it was british , in calling the guys , they say they did not have the part .
neutral	i feel 0st choice should at_least verify that parts exist and if they don_'_t the suppliers should have a negative rating for saying they did .
neutral	ended_up buying from germany which including delivery was cheaper_than getting it in britain ( how strange )
neutral	prices are good .
neutral	merchandise as_advertised .
neutral	however , shipping is somewhat slow and the order arrived in pieces several days apart making timing of installation awkward .
neutral	core_return requires a return_authorization that is not included in original shipment - must be done online .
neutral	delivery of my purchases was fast so i have no problem there .
neutral	however , the pro tools student_edition that i received was already in use .
neutral	therefore i then had to contact avid to get a new , unused verification_code .
neutral	price great , part great , website great , shipping totally sucked .
neutral	placed order on a saturday , and from monday through wednesday , part made it from new_jersey to new_york .
neutral	part made it to distribution hub in sacramento by friday , but when i went there to retrieve it -- a ways out of my way -- they said it was buried under a thousand other parcels in a delivery van .
neutral	understandable , but i knew part was just going to sit there over the weekend to be delivered on monday .
neutral	it was , at closing time at my wife '_s work .
neutral	she had already left .
neutral	i did not get my part until tuesday_night .
neutral	simply unacceptable .
neutral	there '_s no reason_why ground_shipping shouldn_'_t get to me during the latter part of the week .
neutral	for this reason , i would be reluctant to order from you again .
neutral	fed_ex sucks !

neutral	i had purchased a dog barrier for my vehicle and after waiting almost three_weeks for shipping to get my package there were some hooks missing making install of the product impossible .
neutral	so after many phone_calls and emails and waiting another 0_weeks for the hook kit to arrive i was able to successfully install the dog barrier in my vehicle .
neutral	that being said , this dog barrier that travall makes is the nicest most well made piece i have ever_seen or found .
neutral	it is not one of those cheap - o plastic universal fit barriers .
neutral	i love the all metal construction .
neutral	they are custom made to your specific vehicle and do not rattle one bit .
neutral	they are a perfect_fit and i highly_recommend this product to others .
neutral	bought this for my ipod classic bit of an effort to get it sitting correctly .
neutral	and i dont think it '_s quite the right size and no clear panel for screen .
neutral	that apart it is a nice lookin thing and resonably cheap , quick delivery
neutral	we appeared to have a bad connection on my end , and i should have hang_up at getting the static on the phone .
neutral	i requested information on my priorty club number , but agent was not helpful .
neutral	i requested a state employee government_rate and was not provided one .
neutral	i was not informed that my account was being charged as a prepay .
neutral	i will avoid the toll_free number in the future .
neutral	we '_ll i ordered a tuner witch was the wrong one i needed so that was my bad so .
neutral	so i call and talked to jd . so he got the old tuner said he would take_care of it wrong .
neutral	i have been waiting on a tuner for almost 0 week with little or no contact from jd i will never by from them agin
neutral	my orders were consistently late even_though they were sometimes made months in advance .
neutral	the last order was on time .
neutral	the price and delivery were good , but , unfortunately , they sent a used book when the website clearly_indicated it was supposed to be new .
neutral	the book i ordered is somewhat rare and the condition was good so i kept it .
neutral	i had a lot of questions to ask when i was trying to place an order and there was no one or not even a phone_number to talk to a person .
neutral	i will not order from this place ever again .
neutral	customer service is and should be number one with any company unless their trying to hide something .
neutral	i would definitely think_twice about purchasing from merlin_cycles in the future , and i would urge_anyone_who did so to read the returns_policy first .
neutral	i bought a tt helmet from these_guys , which turned_out to be the wrong_size .
neutral	so i sent it back as per the instructions on their returns page costing me £ 0 . 00 ( as it is at your expense ), only to be told that they no_longer had the size i wanted in stock .
neutral	therefore , spent nearly_£_00 to get nothing !
neutral	i should just be thankful they didn_'_t charge me the re - stocking_fee , which is apparently at their discretion .
neutral	i think i '_ll stick to using some of the bigger online_retailers in future , at_least their returns are free .
neutral	...
neutral	0 days from order
neutral	the problem with booking on phone is a small deviation on name of resort can make big_difference .
neutral	i accidentally booked grand bahia principe instead of one of the other two grand bahai '_s located on beach .
neutral	when realizing mistake i called in a couple hours_later with a lot of friction .
neutral	long_story they seem content with me staying with current booking unhappy or canceling it and starting all over .
neutral	mcdonald '_s gets a lot of bad press for the nutritional quality of their food .
neutral	to an extent , i agree , it '_s not the best food you can eat but in a pinch it works .
neutral	i don_'_t eat at mcdonald '_s for the quality of food , i eat there occasionally for the convenience .
neutral	a quick breakfast sandwich and an iced coffee picked_up through a drive through on a hurried commute to work .
neutral	a cheap and tasty dessert shake after dinner out elsewhere .
neutral	the occasional times i '_ve left my wallet at home , i '_m still able to get lunch with just the change in my car .
neutral	no , they don_'_t have great food , but they do offer great convenience .
neutral	item was listed as in stock .
neutral	hours_later was notified order was cancelled due to availability .
neutral	unable to make the purchase because i was a first time customer and needed the product mailed to a destination other than my billing_address .
neutral	i appreciate the precaution you have in place , however it seems the process in such situations could be less complicated .
neutral	like a lot of people out there , i was looking for a way of backing up my photos on line .
neutral	all of the programs including this one have said their program others something different , but fail to live upto the statement .
neutral	no sub folders , no way of mass downloading etc , yet another company who_wants people to upload their collections but need to buy the dvd '_s to regain their albums .
neutral	not impressed !
neutral	!
neutral	i believe that parts_geek is a first rate supplier , however , i ordered 0 parts for the passanger side of my 0000_chevy venture two_weeks_ago and received them in what i believe was very good and record time .
neutral	i needed the exact_same parts ( head_light and cornering light ) for the drivers_side and within the two_weeks time period was quoted an_additional $_00 . 00 .
neutral	whats_going on ?
neutral	i thought the poster is really nice , but a little too expensive .
neutral	i bought this for 00 dollars on the same day i bought a poster on amazon for 0 dollars .
neutral	with both using standard shipping , i got the 0 dollar poster in less_than a week , while the redbubble poster took nearly 0_weeks .
neutral	so the posters are little too expensive , and the shipping tomes a little too_long as well .
neutral	was dissapointed that i lost the oppurtunity for a discount on no delivery fee by a few dollars ... the software did not reveal final total and was unforgiving in the oppurtunity to order more product and avoid shipping fees
neutral	i had to wait 00 days until i could request a refund ... ended_up being a hassle ordering online so will stick to using shops !
neutral	it took to long for the shipment , u can do a lot better_than that if i plan to buy in the future .
neutral	the fuse ( blown ) kept the emergency generator from coming on when the main power was shut_off during the test .
neutral	not very reassuring .
neutral	especially since my sump pump is running as we speak .
neutral	there goes my peace of mind !!!!
neutral	and i was going to sell my portable generator .
neutral	i ordered two mountain boston terrier tee_shirts for christmas_gifts very late in the season ( 00 / 00 ).
neutral	i was hoping that they would arrive before_christmas but i was prepared for them to arrival shortly_after .
neutral	i was elated to recieve an_email_informing_me that my order had shipped on 00 / 00 and was provided a shipment tracking_number .
neutral	i received my order on 00 / 00 however upon_opening the package , only one of the two tee_shirts were shipped .
neutral	the packing_list showed 0 ordered , 0 shipped and 0 backordered .
neutral	upon_calling petflow , i was informed they only had one of the two tee_shirts to ship in the size that i ordered .
neutral	had petflow communicated the stockout before they shipped , i may have elected to change the size or order another item .
neutral	other than the lack of communication concerning the out of stock situation , i was pleased with the online ordering_process , the processing time and the product .
neutral	pc arrived as expected .
neutral	really happy with it .
neutral	only one slight_issue - i had also ordered a monitor and this did not arrive with the pc .
neutral	dino_pc tell me this was due to a courier mistake , but only they will know if that '_s true or not .
neutral	the monitor came the next_day , but it meant i had another day to wait before i could set it all up .
neutral	other than that , i found the website very easy to navigate , it was particularly strong for allowing you to customise your machine so it had everything you wanted .
neutral	delivery time was at the top end of what they suggested , and my email to ask for an estimated delivery day was ignored ( when you spend £_000 on a pc + monitor i didn_'_t think a reply was too much to ask ).
neutral	thankfully the pc came and was exactly as expected and worked_perfectly .
neutral	i would recommend dino_pc but would hope they could iron out some of the issues i experienced .
neutral	while the company had a great reputation online , i found that i had to do a lot of clean up work after the fact .
neutral	i was excited that there was even a quality control put into place , but in my opinion , they left a lot to be desired .
neutral	you get what you pay for .
neutral	free shipping is good
neutral	colors don_'_t exactly appear on site as they do in person .
neutral	it '_s also hard to tell what the material weight and feel will be , and also the fit , which is why online returns for clothing are so vital .
neutral	free shipping to the u . s . is nice , but if the item doesn_'_t fit , you must mail it back to the u . k . at your own_expense .
neutral	even if you live near one of their u . s . stores , they will not accept online returns , which is a very terrible policy .
neutral	order entry was easy enough .
neutral	apparently one item was back - ordered which i only learned because i happened to check order status .
neutral	it would have been nice to have an_email that the item was back - ordered so i could decide how to proceed .
neutral	as it was , i called and had the available items shipped which was easy enough and everything arrived_promptly thereafter .
neutral	just added an unneeded day to the process .
neutral	i don_'_t know why , the poster was bent and had some weird white spots on its middle part .
neutral	this is a great service , with a mobile_fitter coming to your place of work within a reasonable window .
neutral	made contact as_promised 00_mins before attending site , and was professional , friendly and did a great job .
neutral	however ( and a shame , this ), it was booked online for a date offered by the website .
neutral	i got a call ( which went to voicemail ) and a message_saying they would install a day later than i had booked .
neutral	so , i called to correct the booking , and the call_centre confirmed that they had two dates on the system , and would call in the morning ( ie .
neutral	the intended day of install ) to confirm .
neutral	this did not happen .
neutral	i waited at the location to ensure i didn_'_t miss the appointment , and eventually called in the afternoon to find out where the fitter was .
neutral	they apologised and said they had to order the tyres and would be in stock the next_day .
neutral	not good .
neutral	they did accept a change of fitting address due to my being elsewhere the next_day but overall a frustrating experience and brought the score down from a 0 ( for the actual fitter !)
neutral	to a 0 ( overall - it would be a 0 for the backoffice experience ...)
neutral	i '_ve been using greased_lightning products for a few_years_now and can '_t rate their products enough especially the showroom shine , it leaves a great shine , the water beads straight off and once you '_ve built up the layers cleaning is a breeze ( no more scrubbing tar and damaging the paint ).
neutral	the reason for three stars is due to my last experience when ordering , i ordered the engine and fuel treatment ( which is also great ) on a buy one get one free deal .
neutral	i was unsure if you had to put two packs into your basket or just the one so i contacted them through facebook to ask but no response , in the end i bit the bullet and just ordered the one pack in the hope i ' d receive two .
neutral	when it arrived only one pack came so i called the premium number to let them know i wanted the frew pack and it turns_out that i did only have to buy the one pack and it was a picking error no where on the order form did it say bogof .
neutral	they did send the free one out but if i didn_'_t chase it i woukd have missed out and still no reply through facebook .
neutral	ups have lost custom invoices yet again resulting in further delay
neutral	i went on line , got a quote which was acceptable .
neutral	put in my account name and the last password i remembered .
neutral	it was obviously wrong as it was rejected .
neutral	i applied for a new one .
neutral	nothing came .
neutral	don_'_t they want my order , i wondered .
neutral	in the end i emailed a comment and was contacted by phone and a very good lady manually fed in a password so that i could complete the order .
neutral	it shouldn_'_t take hours to send me another password .
neutral	i '_m expecting the same problem when i order next as i '_m totally confused as to which of the three passwords you sent me is the right one .
neutral	i suspect none !
neutral	please prove me wrong .
neutral	on a brighter note the oil came promptly and with a bulk purchase discount .
neutral	move - in was easy , the building is reasonable , and the unit is fine .
neutral	after less_than 0 months they raised the rate by 00 %.
neutral	seems excessive after such a short time .
neutral	makes me feel_like the rate was an intro teaser .
neutral	your prices are great and the ordering_process was smooth enough , but i ordered four items and the email i received noted that each item had four tracking_numbers !!!
neutral	trying to track the packages was a nightmare , so i gave up and just waited .
neutral	two of the items arrived on friday and the other two on monday !
neutral	it was free shipping , and it seems like you are screwing yourself because all four items would have easily fit into one box !
neutral	it was two struts and two strut mounts .
neutral	it wasn_'_t four different items , and they were not that big .
neutral	as far as the four tracking_numbers for each item , i have no_idea what that was about ...
neutral	i '_ve used fed_ex before and i never had more than one tracking_number .
neutral	if you could stream line the shipping and put the items in one box , you might be able to lower your prices even more !!
neutral	!
neutral	partsgeek saved me from making a wrong choice .
neutral	i was not aware that there are two different cooling reservoir tanks for my car .
neutral	so i made the right choice and saved money too .
neutral	dance 00 .
neutral	but ... 0 days delivery time from fresno to sacramento ?
neutral	really ?
neutral	i paid shipping_charges for this ?
neutral	looks 0 .
neutral	useful links related to residential property , commercial property , investment property in india
neutral	some initial confusion over how the whole thing works , email with ' welcome package ' was slow coming through .
neutral	easy handover at local shop which impressed me , as i sort of thought they were going to look blankly at me .
neutral	but then it seemed to take a week to pick the goods up and they spent forever in processing .
neutral	good overall but i would think_twice about using again just because of the time it took .
neutral	00 days from delivery to payment .
neutral	too_long .
neutral	cheers .
neutral	i ordered alpha_brain from onnit .
neutral	product works great ... if you take 0 .
neutral	that means i '_ll be spending well over $_000 a month for this stuff .
neutral	i dont think i '_ll be doing that .
neutral	either strengthen the product or lose your non_- millionaire customers .
neutral	well the items that you sold me was much_cheaper_than you give me a price on
neutral	your ad says if the order is in before 0 pm , it will be shipped that day .
neutral	it took six days ( 0 business days ) for my order to arrive ..
neutral	i still have not been told how to return the alternator core .
neutral	they kept sending me the wrong thing
neutral	ordered my lights , only received half the order .
neutral	called in , was treated very nicely and apologized to in what really felt_like a sincere manner .
neutral	got the rest of my order 0 days_later .
neutral	we infall the lights next week , so the product hasn_'_t been fully tried out yet .
neutral	the catologing was wrong and cost me freight back .
neutral	overall good shopping_experience but when i realize that they were the missing part in the car i have no response back from the dealership
neutral	even_though i ordered and paid on sunday , the order wasnt dispatched until the wed , so didnt get the package until the following friday
neutral	there was a time when aol was everywhere and controlled most communication online .
neutral	there was even a time when aol was the way to get on the internet .
neutral	those days are long gone and what '_s left over doesn_'_t compete with other_sites and products out there on the web ..
neutral	good delivery .
neutral	unfortunately my jacket was stolen before i opened the box :-(
neutral	the ordering was easy and straight_forward .
neutral	the shipping was covered and it was fast .
neutral	looking for kits there are parts which include parts when working on items usually needed when working on replacement parts .
neutral	found same part in kit with everything for replacing a timing_belt for less .
neutral	the product was good but shipping could be cheaper .
neutral	bought the same product from another sight for the same price but 0 / 0 shipping_costs and better return_policy .
neutral	the clear part of the lense and the bifocal part are not proportional .
neutral	the clear section is way too small .
neutral	the bifocal line can be seen no matter where you focus your eyes .
neutral	website , price , lenses , all good but the frames i received where not as_described at point of sale .
neutral	frame height measurement differed by 00_% which totally changes the proportion of the expected design .
neutral	the product was right on .
neutral	that is what mattered to me the most .
neutral	however , the package was taped up horribly causing both of my parts to be sticking partially out of the box .
neutral	i wouldnt be surprised if they had fallen out at one point as it looked like someone had shoved them back in .
neutral	also , the box was just way too big in general .
neutral	all i ordered were two plastic pieces for a bumper and the box couldve fit about 00 times what was in it .
neutral	quite unnessecary .
neutral	also , there was no packing_slip or anything that made this delivery feel authentic .
neutral	i like seeing a packing_slip and a receipt and neither were in there .
neutral	but like i said , i am pleased with the parts .
neutral	i don_'_t often buy food through delivery . com , mainly_because they have few restaurant options ( even in center city philadelphia ), and the ones that are on their site have limited hours of operation .
neutral	i can go on grubhub or foodler . com and find more options at more times of the day , some with free delivery , whereas you are hard_pressed to find a restaurant on delivery . com that doesn_'_t charge a fee .
neutral	they have some decent promotions by email ($ 0 off , $_00 off ), but it always seems that i spend the same amount with the promotion as i do on other_sites without one because of the higher fees .
neutral	the site has potential if they got more restaurants on board .
neutral	my tie_rods arrived but one box had a hole torn in the inner bag and the zirc ( grease ) fitting , castle nut and cotter pin were removed , the other one was fine .
neutral	required another $ 0 dollar investment and a trip to the parts store to get started .
neutral	tell the warehouse guys to keep there fingers out of the boxes so they arrive with all the parts promised .
neutral	frustrating !!!!
neutral	!
neutral	will order again , but will be contacting them and fedex and fda .
neutral	my order was held up at customs and i tried getting information from ampm .
neutral	they would not get me the information i needed until they were contacted by fedex .
neutral	the end_result , i received my order after a week of headaches and phone_calls .
neutral	i did not receive a phone_call as_promised within 00_hours after making the tentative booking .
neutral	then when i called back , the quoted price went up $_000 a person so it was a very poor response
neutral	etyres provided a good service but as a past customer of theirs , i was dissapointed to be charged for an attempted repair that failed to find or fix a tyre leak , when i went on to have the new tyre fitted the following_day !
neutral	i would be more inclined to use etyres again if the failed repair charge had been reimbursed when i ordered the new tyre and had it fitted at a cost of £_000 . 00 !
neutral	the brake_pedal pad i ordered for my 0000 isuzu p ' up came in but it was the wrong_size .
neutral	it came in a separte shipping box which i found odd since it fit in the first shipping box .
neutral	anyway the part number sent to me was 0 - 00000 - 000 - 0 .
neutral	the brake_pedal pad was too big .
neutral	also , i also needed the clutch_pedal pad for same vehicle but it was not available on the internet catalog .
neutral	i have ordered quite a few orders , however , its seems that my account does not get taken_care of by employees .
neutral	slow on parts , slow on back orders , and very slow on refunds .
neutral	maybe living in arizona has its disadvantages ?
neutral	i recently_purchased a bundle .
neutral	it arrived in a couple of days so no issue there .
neutral	the problem was it looked like it had be kicked for the last mile .
neutral	the shaker was cracked & i was very suprised that there was nothing missing .
neutral	the bundle is great value for money .
neutral	i would not let the delivery service put me off .
neutral	the rental was ok , car was good and we got it without a problem , but we had to by a full_tank of fuel as well which came in as a surprise afterwards .
neutral	although we had the car just for 0 days and left 0 / 0 of the fuel unused we had to pay for it .
neutral	this is a bad surprise and would make me think_twice to before taking this car_rental again next time .
neutral	i '_m in to health and fitness for the past few_years , and ispend quite a lot of my supplements montly , ie protein , creatine , multivitamins , but i don_'_t buy always here cuz of the prices , mostly stuff here is quite pricy where i can get same quite few pound cheaper
neutral	ordered hood first of dec 0000 .
neutral	they sent the wrong hood .
neutral	have requested information be sent to me by phone , cell or email .
neutral	have yet been able to get a status ?
neutral	i '_ve talked to support staff , there very helpful , but i think there lost in trying provide status or if part is ordered or not .
neutral	i '_m going on a month without the hood .
neutral	i still have the wrong hood in my shop and waiting for the right one ?
neutral	last time i talked to them was today 0 / 0 / 0000 .
neutral	they can '_t promise me time frame for my back order .
neutral	customer is starting to get mad over the whole_ordeal .
neutral	they said , they five me a status tomorrow ?
neutral	i '_ll keep you posted .
neutral	got a comfirmation email for my order , waited a few day nothing came .
neutral	rang up and asked where my order was , was told i never made an order but its currently out of stock .
neutral	organised a second order which came without problem .
neutral	customer service were very helpful .
neutral	i wouldn_'_t have a problem using musclefood again .
neutral	bought an ignition cylinder with two transponder keys for a 0000 explorer .
neutral	website advertised fitting all explorers with transponders for that year .
neutral	the cylinder fit , but the onboard pc would not recognize the key transponders .
neutral	it recognized ford keys just fine .
neutral	a piece of the signal_light was broke off , but i was able to switch it out with the old one that was on my other side_mirror .
neutral	other than that it was a fast delivery and eay buy .
neutral	the prices are good but i had a problem with my first order .
neutral	the radiator was damaged ( box was ripped and smashed ) and in the end it took over 0 months of me constantly sending emails to them to get a refund .
neutral	i was then to receive free shipping on the next two orders but was never able to get through on the phone o place the order .
neutral	whenever i call , i just end up on hold .
neutral	i am not sure why they just did not issue a promo_code for the free shipping .
neutral	several pages were printed with a white margin at the top even_though none showed on the page images whilst preparing or sending the source pages .
neutral	customer service have agreed to look at the problem and to allow the photobook to be resubmitted .
neutral	i have returned the book to jessops but have received no reply to date .
neutral	i have used jessops photobook service previously without_any_problems .
neutral	have visited their site , but bever availed myself of any purchase optgions .
neutral	use infrequently but seems satisfactory .
neutral	good value for money but the 0 week delay on date quoted for delivery put all my trades behind
neutral	jeg_er fornøyd_med handel hos dere , takk .
neutral	great delivery at the start of our trip ; way too_long on the pickup -- was over 00_minutes after calling the hotel
neutral	very pricey .
neutral	the apple_store is always too_busy and it gives me a headache .
neutral	some of the " genius " staff are not very helpful .
neutral	i find the os not very intuitive .
neutral	beautiful machines .
neutral	very fast -- most of the time .
neutral	great graphics , etc .
neutral	what was missing was an_email with the code .
neutral	i had to enter in the site to search for it .
neutral	so i ordered brake_pads , rotors , a belt and thermostat .
neutral	t - stat and belt came the next_day .
neutral	that '_s great .
neutral	a week_later i get the rotors only ???
neutral	finally 0 days_later i get the pads .
neutral	the pads and rotors were shipped from the same warehouse .
neutral	why did it take them 0 more days to get them out ?
neutral	prices are great .
neutral	customer service isn_'_t so great .
neutral	i tried_calling with a question 0 times .
neutral	every time after being on hold for 00_minutes , the automated answering system told me they were experiencing a high_volume of calls and to call back .
neutral	i also previously ordered wheel_bearings which also came like 0 days after .
neutral	so they have 0 win and 0 loss at this point for me .
neutral	i will order again because the prices can '_t be beat , however i hope i '_m not disappointed again .
neutral	in the future i will probably allow more time for myself when ordering .
neutral	the oil supplier selected by boilerjuice did text me the day before to inform they were coming , as requested .
neutral	their driver was here just after 0am , no problem , but immediately started verbals about trees , asking for cutting back around the tank ' for next time ' etc .
neutral	i have to say the filler spout is not particularly overgrown , and he had no problem filling .
neutral	i did say to him that no - one else had ever had a problem ( we have lived here nearly 00 years ) and was told ' we have changed our policy '.
neutral	he did try being more pleasant later , but really the atmosphere was soured .
neutral	not boilerjuice '_s fault , but i do wonder about buying oil direct from a local_supplier next time as i could guarantee this tanker_driver wouldn_'_t be used .
neutral	don_'_t need bad karma brought into my nice warm environment !
neutral	when you have a question you make the consumer jump_through hoops to get to you which makes you feel_like you do everything you can to avoid contact .
neutral	i had an order where the packing_slip said there were 00 items , i only received 0 .
neutral	i wanted to tell you that but i had to open up a ticket which i did and then found out there was another shipment that didn_'_t have a packing_slip and the missing 0 items were in that box with another item .
neutral	i didn_'_t open another ticket to tell you because it is too cumbersome .
neutral	probably_won_'_t use you again because of all that nonsense .
neutral	replacement probably cheaper_than oem , and looks nice !
neutral	i really love the product range at amazon . com
neutral	however , the saddest part is :
neutral	0 .
neutral	it doesnt ship most of the articles to india
neutral	0 .
neutral	even if they ship , the shipping cost is awkwardly high ( for example , i was ordering few articles totalling to 00_usd and the shipping charge on them was 000 usd )
neutral	if i really need something from amazon , i need to give an us address and then ask someone to carry it to india for me .
neutral	had the shipping been regular to india , i , as well as many i know , would have definitely used a lot of service from amazon .
neutral	i '_ve been purchasing from the united_states for several_years and to be fair , most often , my purchases arrive as_described using economy shipping within 0_weeks .
neutral	one time an item arrived not as_described , which i returned at my shipping expense , and another time an item was defective .
neutral	this can happen with any merchant , so as always buyer_beware , but in general xxcycle has_been a reliable_source for not usually available items in the united_states such as stronglight products .
neutral	when on sale , good prices on other european made products such as look pedals and continental tires are usually available .
neutral	the framework was simple to put up and looking at the plans showed me i could erect the building myself
neutral	i was expecting to receive my muffler very fast .
neutral	nope !!!!
neutral	i had made arrangements to have it removed and replaced on the same day .
neutral	getting it one day and putting on the next .
neutral	now they have changed my due date from the 00 of may to the 0rd of june .
neutral	now i have no way of putting it on by myself because i am in no condition to get under a car and move around so one more week with out a car .
neutral	was pleasantly_surprised by rapid shipping and ease of ordering .
neutral	although i was quite eager to try the coffee in my new nespresso maker , i have to be honest .
neutral	i was quickly disenchanted as i found the taste to be nowhere_near the quality of [_external reference ]' s own branded coffees .
neutral	this was a real disappointment as i was eager to find new choices .
neutral	perhaps it '_s the plastic capsules ?
neutral	a slight_annoyance is that the fcc pods don_'_t fit as well ( prone to dropping all the way to bottom and then very stiff when closing ).
neutral	every time i order , however , i pick my shipping method then land on the last page and it always asks me to indicate my shipping method .
neutral	when i do , it always ends up being a huge extra_charge after - the - fact .
neutral	very frustrating .
neutral	ordered the wrong headlight but because there isn_'_t a way to contact partsgeek on the phone .
neutral	it two another 0 - 0 days before the replacement came back .
neutral	i was also out another 0 bucks i had to spend to ship the wrong part back .
neutral	didn_'_t end up saving anything compared with buying at parts store here .
neutral	i bought a traditional 0 inch showerhead which with delivery charges cost me over £_00 which i think is rather steep .
neutral	no_complaints about the prompt delivery by royal_mail though
neutral	i '_ve had hidemyass for two years and it '_s been fine .
neutral	they have a lot of servers in many countries .
neutral	my issue has_been that hidemyass logs too many of my details ... and that they are known to have provided details to law_enforcement that resulted_in the arrest of one of their customers ( cody andrew kretsinger ).
neutral	i actually just subscribed to vpn0all and am having issues getting the vpn up and running ( did not have that issue with hidemyass ), but vpn0all are known to have no logs and therefore they have nothing to provide to law_enforcement ( not that i '_m doing anything illegal : it '_s the principle ).
neutral	positive :
neutral	- fast shipping , free over a certain_amount
neutral	- easy to find parts by searching based_upon your car
neutral	- easy checkout
neutral	negative :
neutral	- site doesn_'_t state how many you need for your car
neutral	- items that should come as a kit end up being sold seperately , but don_'_t tell you in advance .
neutral	for instance , i ordered valve_cover gaskets and the grommets weren_'_t included .
neutral	really ?
neutral	that '_s a necessary part !
neutral	now i have old grommets and need to order new ones and then replace the old_ones .
neutral	a bit disappointed .
neutral	better labeling and including all the parts that are common_sense would make my experience better .
neutral	most of the booking was easy enough but i had to have recourse to a phone_call as the site would not accept the number given to me .
neutral	the shore excursions page was difficult to navigate .
neutral	this should not be caused_by my using the mac os
neutral	very surprised when putting the order through that there would be an ' additional £ 0 . 00 postage , mate !'
neutral	only chose this company because it showed_up on amazon as being the lowest cost , with specifically no postage charge .
neutral	not impressed .
neutral	extensive shopping for a 0 - day long car_rental in sydney brought me to rentalcars . com .
neutral	the price and terms of the rental seemed fine , and the reservation process seemed simple enough .
neutral	and then ... first the email_confirmation of the reservation never arrived in my email .
neutral	easy enough to get around that , when i logged back in to find the car pickup_location .
neutral	but then when i went to the reservation_counter in sydney airport , i found there would be aus $_000 extra in charges .
neutral	after a transcontinental plane flight , with an impatient and tired family waiting , i foolishly didn_'_t put up a fuss ( since europecar is not to blame ).
neutral	instead spent the next 0 days feeling resentful about how i ' d been misled .
neutral	rentalcars . com may very well have had some caveats buried in the fine_print , but they fell short of expectations by not making clear the true full cost of a car_rental .
neutral	the quality of the vehicle was the only redeeming quality , but again , that '_s on europecar , not rentalcars . com .
neutral	using boiler_juice is ok because even_though you have an agreed price for the oil at the time of ordering , any savings they can make are credited to your account to be used against future orders .
neutral	i ordered and got a conf number but haven_'_t gotten it and it hit my visa then got credited back ?
neutral	a litle disappointed when i ordered a delivery for my son '_s birthday and even_though i thought i had given enough advance time , it arrived the day after his_birthday , which was on the 00nd sept '.
neutral	smartpost is ill named , should be slow post , delayed delivery by 0 days
neutral	i am not happy with my shipping by fedix
neutral	everything came in as told and how they showed on line .
neutral	the only_thing was that one of the pieces broke , i asume on the way here .
neutral	i did not want to return and then have it sent out to me again , but other than that . it was probably fed_ex .
neutral	so maybe let them know to be more carefull in hangling items .
neutral	fitovers are great for people who wear glasses , i use them for fishing , hunting , driving and sports .
neutral	they used to be economical but have more than doubled in price , ugh !
neutral	i will not buy this brand again .
neutral	the daily spending_limit has no relation to history spending i want to buy more than 00_usd and by introducing this concept of limiting the daily spending it '_s like telling a customer sorry you can only buy this jacket and you have to come tomorrow for the t - shirt and after for the socks etc ...
neutral	please revise your policy the is true turn off .
neutral	not bad , but not great , guess real price was inflated to make discounted price look good , definately not worth the before price at all , ours was delivered on a pallet and all contents where wet and all box '_s waterlogged , driver didnt want to hang about whilst we checked it so we had to sign unchecked , so we have a garage full of soggy cardboard and a bloody pallet i don_'_t want and now have to get_rid of , everything had to be immediately removed from packaging as water logged , very dissapointed with delivery at the price we was charged for it .
neutral	summary :- low quality suite , poorly assembled with low quality fittings , toilet_seat went straight in the recyling bin , would not use again or recommend .
neutral	customer_support_ticket system computer form for " submit " -- refuses to " submit "
neutral	due to notice , " you '_ve reached the maximum open tickets allowed " !!!
neutral	??
neutral	?
neutral	so trying to establish an ra seems fruitless regardless of the seemingly friendly efficient method .
neutral	this needs to be corrected and " contact " with parts_geek made more easier and user_friendly .
neutral	r . hoover
neutral	the catalytic pipe didn_'_t fit into the resonator pipe , and two of the gaskets didn_'_t fit .
neutral	after some metalwork and a trip to napa , the 0 pieces went together , exhaust sounds good .
neutral	will return the gaskets .
neutral	jeg_købte_et gtx 000 oc fra msi på komplett . dk til hele 0000 kr .. den kører skidt i 0 - 0 dage med crashes , åbenbart dårlige ledninger og andre underlige problemer .
neutral	jeg overvejer så at sende den ind , men kan_ikke undvære et grafikkort pga .
neutral	arbejde og_jeg_kan_ikke få sendt et_nyt før de_har modtaget det gamle ( hvilket i sidste ende vel også_er fair nok .. bare meget tragisk i min situation !)
neutral	nåh , jeg går så og gumler lidt på_det , og ender med at ville sende den ind .
neutral	jeg åbner så mit kabinet , for at tage kortet ud så_jeg_kan_få det pakket .
neutral	grundet at jeg simpelthen bestemmer mig for at jeg_ikke_vil finde mig i dette defekte lort , jeg_har_brugt så_mange penge på , og_så sammen_med alle_de andre dårlige oplevelser med_det kort på de 0 dage jeg_har_haft kortet opdager jeg at en blæser vinge er faldet af .. jeg tjekker om der sidder ledninger eller lignende og nej ingen risiko for at den kan have ramt en ledning , og_det_er satme underligt at sådan_en vinge falder af 0 dage_efter kortet er pakket ud .
neutral	kortet er_ikke tabt eller lignende ( det_har de så også hos komplett konstanteret efter at den_er_blevet tjekket i deres returafdeling )
neutral	nå jeg_får den sendt ind osv .
neutral	med_den dårlige føelse efter kundeservice har fortalt mig at en vinge ikke bare falder af , af sig selv .
neutral	jeg_er magtesløs , og kan intet bevise .
neutral	de kan selvfølgelig ikke gøre noget ved det på_deres returafdeling som_jeg_havde desværre havde forventet .
neutral	grundet at det åbenbart ikke_er_en_del af reklamationsretten .
neutral	men supporteren siger dog , at jeg_kan kontakte msi , og_hvis_jeg_kan_få god fra_dem , vil komplett . dk sende mig et_nyt kort , hvis_jeg_får en e_-_mail fra msi om at det_er ok , så msi kan sende et_nyt kort til komplett . dk .
neutral	meget rodet , og dårlig service , men åbenbart det bedste man_kan gøre i denne sag .
neutral	jeg_har_nu fået_en mail fra msi hvor_der_står det_er op_til komplett at finde_ud_af det , de skal blot sende det defekte kort ind_til msi til rma , så får de det enten repareret eller får et_nyt .
neutral	så lige pt .
neutral	står det til at ende godt for mig , grunden til at jeg_kan_få_et_nyt kort er kun pga .
neutral	kortets meget korte alder på små 0 dage inden den blev_sendt ind , og dette har komplett ikke skrevet men msi , så hvis_ikke msi havde været så flinke og forstående havde_jeg nok stået med_en_meget tom følelse i mig lige nu .
neutral	nu håber jeg komplett svarer på_min mail med_et positivt svar .
neutral	jeg_har valgt at give 0_stjerner , fordi jeg_synes det_er for ringe at man som_kunde med_en så defekt varer som_er_så ny , at den dårligt nok er taget i brug , skal tæskes igennem så_mange ting .
neutral	når_man så samtidig står med så dyr en varer der_er defekt som_man_har_haft i 0 dage , gør_det slet_ikke sagen bedre .
neutral	jeg_har endnu ikke oplevet så dårlig service før .
neutral	samtidig med at jeg siger jeg_har_fået dårlig service vil_jeg dog pointere at jeg_synes det_er super flot , at komplett . dk ikke " taber mig " her til sidst og bare sender kortet retur men stadig holder ved og giver mig en_ny metode til måske at et_nyt og ikke defekt kort , netop ved at hjælpe_mig igennem ved at fortælle mig at jeg_kan skirve til msi .
neutral	derefter hvis svaret fra msi så_er positivt kunne give mig et_nyt kort , og en bedre oplevelse ved komplett . dk , men i sidste ende vil msi nok få_den største ære .
neutral	oveni skal det ligges at jeg samtidig bestilte_en samsung ssd 000 , som funker perfekt , ingen_problemer , super hurtig ssd og alle pengene værd !
neutral	we often go with part geeks because they have better prices .
neutral	the only issue is that shipping takes longer then other_companies .
neutral	you are also charged more for shipping because even_though you only have one order often the parts are coming from different_locations causing shipping to be more .
neutral	the other issue i have is .
neutral	the return process .
neutral	i only order if i '_m certain it '_s the right part because it is about impossible to return an item through their totally automated_system ... sent several emails to try and return product and never got a response .
neutral	called the phone_number and was told to go to web_site .
neutral	no live_person to talk to ...
neutral	we did receive the cat_food as_promised but the expiration_date on the two cases
neutral	of cat_food was a little closer than we anticipated ( june 00000 ).
neutral	usually when we
neutral	have ordered cat_food the expiration_date was typically six_months off .
neutral	still_awaiting my order , but this was the lowest_price for my item on the internet .
neutral	a bit_slower on the shipping end , and no automated receipt made me curious if my order went through .
neutral	no_complaints though due to the low pricing !
neutral	you have to be patient if you want to pay a low price !
neutral	that sums it up .
neutral	cheap rental , watch out for extras on arrival .
neutral	and the usual trick , full_tank of petrol to pay for , why is it so expensive !!
neutral	hire_cars must have larger petrol tanks than the standard models .
neutral	and the usual bring it back empty , who takes a hire car back to the airport when it is running on fumes .
neutral	the price of our rental_car was very reasonable but our decision to fill up car with gas en_route close to sydney airport drop_off proved a very costly mistake .
neutral	we tried to find all of the 0 gas stations given by staff , but were unable to locate any .
neutral	the map given by staff was inaccurate and not clear .
neutral	we were concerned_about being late for our flight so decided to take to drop_off without fill up with the thought we would try to explain dilemma with staff .
neutral	at airport no staff_member was available so we were forced to leave car with parking staff .
neutral	this cast a negative light on what could have been an easy and pleasant part of our vacation .
neutral	is there any way we can discount this added expense ?
neutral	thank_you
neutral	easy to book .
neutral	i ' am not real happy with the ink cartage because it does not come up to let_me know that the cartage is full , it just shows that it is blank ??
neutral	so not happy about that .
neutral	i ordered one iphone case and one set of ipad skins .
neutral	the case was delivered about one week_later , but the skins weren_'_t .
neutral	i opened a support request , but it went_unanswered .
neutral	a few_days_later , i received another package , with a new case ( which i hadn_'_t ordered , it was wrongly delivered ), but still no skin .
neutral	i opened another request , which was answered , telling_me to wait a bit more .
neutral	finally , one week after the original delivery , i received the skin .
neutral	i found the quality of the case print to be noticeably low .
neutral	it looks blurry and undefined , which is particularly worrisome as i intended it as a gift to a designer .
neutral	the skins have much higher quality .
neutral	their customer service is generally responsive ( although one of my requests went_unanswered and i had to open another ticket ).
neutral	there was nothing on the website saying that my tien suspension was not in stock so when i finally see that it '_s been shipped more than a month later my patience has_been kind ground down .
neutral	the customer service and the pricing were excellent and i will use this company again but i expect to not have this issue again .
neutral	order # 0z0xr0000000000000
neutral	when you receive the products i can give my opinion .
neutral	glasses sent to billing_address rather_than delivery address .
neutral	bit of a pain .
neutral	i ordered two upper strut seats .
neutral	the boxes were identical but the parts were not .
neutral	one of the parts seams much_better made with a sealed barring .
neutral	the other was not sealed and needed barring grease .
neutral	each part comes with three nuts to fasten the part to the car body .
neutral	one part had aluminum colored bolts and nuts , the other had longer bolts and nuts that were more of a gold color .
neutral	i had to use a deep socket on that one .
neutral	now my mini_cooper is not symmetrical .
neutral	next time i need a matching pair , will go to a shop so i can see what i am getting .
neutral	its like replacing two front tires , you make_sure they are the same .
neutral	time will tell how good quality control is .
neutral	positive : the parts were priced well and showed_up on time .
neutral	i would think that this isn_'_t something that happens a lot .
neutral	keine verpackung vom gutschein .

neutral	i was late for my granddaughter '_s birthday so i opted for the 0 day delivery at extra_cost .
neutral	little did i know it was fedex .
neutral	they kept trying to deliver to a household mid_morning when no one was home .
neutral	finally on the third morning the housecleaner was available to accept the package .
neutral	as a result of fedex '_s refusal to accommodate my gift was 0 days late instead of 0 days late .
neutral	det gik hurtigt fra jeg_havde_bestilt til jeg_fik min_vare , men_da_jeg_fik varen_var spillet ridset ( så min xbox havde lidt problemer_med at læse spillet ) men_da_jeg_fik installeret spillet på xboxen gik det bedre , men stadig_ikke 000_%

neutral	tak for en_god handel :)
neutral	my first 0 years using bitdefender were great .
neutral	then it went down_hill .
neutral	midway through the third year my laptop began crashing .
neutral	when i looked at the log files it showed bitdefender as being the application at fault .
neutral	bitdefender fixed it .
neutral	then progrmas would not run unless the firewall would be off .
neutral	again another fix .
neutral	before the fourth year , my subsciption was auto renewed even after i had disabled that feature at the start of year 0 .
neutral	the last 0 version say they don_'_t take much computer power but i can barel browse the web without my computers freezing up because of the updates bitdefender does .
neutral	my order arrived_safely in under 00_hours , but one of three items supplied ( an oil_filter ) was the incorrect fitting for the car .
neutral	i '_ll see how good the returns service is after the bank_holiday !
neutral	products were perfect and very reasonably_priced but the delivery was a big let_down , asked for it to be delivered after half two , the delivery company texted me saying the would be there between 00 & 0 and when i rang to ask to hold off till after two the lady said it i wasnt in the house when it arrived that i would have to collect it myself from ballymount , which is further than the actual shop it '_s being delivered from !
neutral	they were not helpful at all !
neutral	i can understand the have a schedule but i requested it to be delivered after half two !!
neutral	!
neutral	foto van_de " trendy vetplanten tuinmix " laat een aparte vierkante schaal zien , wat werd afgeleverd was een ordinair rond bord .
neutral	was dus niet wat_ik besteld had of verwacht had , verkeerd / vals / fout adverteren dus .
neutral	i don_'_t understand how parts_geek can ship a product so fast but take_forever to give an_rma_number .
neutral	i actually emailled them 0 times to get this number but still waited a week after my part arrived at my house .
neutral	i would like it if the number arrived with the part .
neutral	it was very annoying that as much as i like how fast i got my product , i '_m actually now more likely to by a product that has a core_charge locally .
neutral	i like to buy online because it '_s convenient and fast but dealing_with this core is very slow .
neutral	they said it could take as much as 00 days to get my core money sent to me .
neutral	i know parts_geek can do better_than that .
neutral	good value product delivered quickly , the only problem is that i specifically selected do not leave with the next door neighbour and that is exactly_what happened .
neutral	that was annoying .
neutral	the door_handle of my fridge broke , so ordered a new handle .
neutral	the old handle had a self_adhesive strip to cover the fixing screws .
neutral	this had to be damaged to get out the screws , so i assumed a new would come with the handle .
neutral	it didn_'_t though so had to order this separately , although it was agreed not to charge postage .
neutral	when this arrived , the strip covering self_adhesive had come away , so adhesive had partly dried .
neutral	another was sent , which was even worse , so used my own impact adhesive to fix .
neutral	end_result good , but need to do better
neutral	i am so in need of the parts order 00 - 0000000 , a window right side window_motor for 0000 000 porsche .
neutral	i can '_t get any information as to a shipping date or eta .
neutral	please in form us of the above information .
neutral	thank_you .
neutral	autoeurope told us that the hertz_counter was in the train_station in naples .
neutral	it was outside the train_station .
neutral	there were no signs directing us .
neutral	we walked around for 00_minutes in the rain trying to find it with our_luggage .
neutral	when we did find hertz we then had to walk 0 blocks in the rain with our_luggage to the garage which had the car .
neutral	i ordered some converse but they did not suit so i sent them back .
neutral	this cost me £ 0 . 00 !
neutral	!.
neutral	the refund was quickly processed but as companies like asos offer a free returns_policy i will not be ordering anything from blackleaf unless i am absolutely sure they are right for me
neutral	about three_weeks_ago i ordered a serpent belt and an a /_c hose the hose was listed for 00 . 00 dollars i thought that was really cheap for the hose , well it was i got an_email_saying that the hose was out of stock so the next_day i went on and they had the hose and now it was 00 . 00 dollars .
neutral	i think they should have honored the price listed or at_least told me that the price was wrong cuz i really needed the hose and would have payed the extra money to get it .
neutral	what they did was slow the whole_process down and made me wait the extra deliervy time .
neutral	i wanted specific seats as my travel companion cannot sit in a window seat .
neutral	it said i could pick them but each time i tried it came back " seating assignment not available ".
neutral	i finally ended_up calling the airlines and paying extra to get assigned seats on both flights .
neutral	not happy with the fact you have to register inorder to buy on line and also site stores your card details automatically if you don_'_t untick a check box , which could easily go unnoticed . could do with a lab analysis to check the validity / quality of the product .. i bought phosphatidylserine .
neutral	delivery was pretty quick but the issue is : they zeroed out a part that was ordered as a set and still sent half the order .
neutral	only after the part arrived i noticed the other part missing , then they sent an_email the next_day with no real explanation but crediting my card back .
neutral	also , the part that arrived was a lower grade part and not what i had ordered .
neutral	i got stuck with shipping cost back to them .
neutral	all in all it cost me a week and a half and i ended_up paying them for return shipping .
neutral	also , very hard to get customer service rep . all automated and online .
neutral	very frustrating !
neutral	to say the least .
neutral	unpacked all furniture , disappointed to find a mark right in centre of dining_table which cost £_000 then when unpacked bedroom_furniture found the mirror was also damaged with a couple of nasty scratches , expected better service from reputable_company .
neutral	i order a part on - line from partsgeek .
neutral	when it arrived i was ready to install the taillight
neutral	when i discovered that it was the wrong part .
neutral	i looked it up on the website and found that the picture of the part didn_'_t match the description .
neutral	the picture was of the passenger_side tail_light and the wording indicated that it was the driver '_s side assembly .
neutral	i tried call and was put on hold for a long time .
neutral	i then sent in a customer service request
neutral	and am waiting for a response .
neutral	even_though it is the parts_geek mistake we '_ll see ......
neutral	i really need to contact some one you guys are very hard to get in touch with i done supported a ticket about 0 days ago what do i do ?
neutral	please contact me willie swain 000 - 000 - 0000
neutral	drop_off was fine but the pickup was subpar .
neutral	first you had to call in or text with your reservation number which is fine considering it was 0 in the morning due to delays .
neutral	i tried the 000 number first , got the disconnected noise .
neutral	so i texted my info .
neutral	luckily , the woman standing next to me was also getting picked_up by them because it appeared the guy didn_'_t know i was there .
neutral	whatever , no big_deal .
neutral	we proceed to the next terminal where they pickup 0 more people and wait for 00_minutes for a 0rd who never showed .
neutral	now , please understand , i '_m a patient person and i work in the transportation business .
neutral	however , all of us in that van had just been through a grueling 00_hours in airport and grounded planes trying to get home due to delays because of weather .
neutral	at some point , you have to weigh customer service vs maximizing your dollar to ensure you get repeat_business .
neutral	and also to realize that sometimes people don_'_t follow directions , like not calling in until you pick_up your checked bags !
neutral	ok , so the dispatcher finally releases the driver without the no show .
neutral	he walks around the front of the van , gets in and starts pulling away .
neutral	luckily , one of the passengers was still relatively alert at that point and noticed that one of the back doors was open !
neutral	that '_s where our_luggage was .
neutral	he would have literally spilled all of our onto the terminal street , including my laptop .
neutral	you could say it was an honest mistake but i '_m sure his bosses wouldn_'_t be thinking so when i filed a claim for a new laptop .
neutral	ok , door is closed and we ' re moving onto the last terminal .
neutral	one pickup , no big_deal .
neutral	moving on .
neutral	the driver is having issues seeing out the front windshield because he has the a /_c blowing on it full blast which on a humid day will condensate all over it .
neutral	rather_than turn it off , he just cranks up the windshield_wipers .
neutral	then i start to hear the noise saying his seat_belt isn_'_t on and we '_ve already left the airport .
neutral	i could personally care less if he wears a seat_belt , but when i '_m trying to get my car and with the potential for you getting pulled over because you aren_'_t wearing one , it rakes on my nerves just a tad .
neutral	also considering we ' re leaving a facility with a heavy police presence .
neutral	ok , he puts the seat_belt on out of annoyance at the sound .
neutral	on the way to the lot .
neutral	my car is there waiting , turned on , ac blasting , just how i like it .
neutral	however , he says i have to go into the office to check out .
neutral	at this point i '_m too exhausted to point out that i prepayed for valet so i didn_'_t have to do this .
neutral	so i go into the office and the attendant prints me up a barcoded ticket which i need to use to exit .
neutral	i scan the barcode and i '_m gone .
neutral	so they get a 0 because they stored my car for 0 days with seemingly no trouble .
neutral	they did eventually get me back to the lot with my bagged not spilled out all over the street .
neutral	and it was nice not having to go find my car .
neutral	however , i '_ll go back to using spot probably
neutral	we rent two parking_spaces at your n . lombard location in portland , or .
neutral	up until recently we have been happy .
neutral	but when we rented the second space the manager told us she would have the space cleaned_up before we " moved in ".
neutral	when we arrived a day later the space was full of trash from the previous tenants .
neutral	we had to remove most of it ourselves .
neutral	additionally the space is covered in moss and leaves and looks_like it has not be really cleaned in years .
neutral	the next time we were there we noticed that the razor and barbed wire near our space had been cut .
neutral	so we pointed it out to the manager who told us they knew about it and had ordered new razor wire and it would fixed within the week .
neutral	that was over 0_weeks_ago and the razor wire is still missing .
neutral	the last issue is that i arrived one morning to find someone sleeping in their van in the lot .
neutral	i would like to think the manager will do what she says , but so_far it feels_like lip service .
neutral	we are now actively looking for 0 new spaces .
neutral	thanks ,
neutral	ian lomax
neutral	prob should of got a sample
neutral	when youtube 0st started off it had nearly every video you wanted to see and watch .
neutral	however nowadays they been taking down quite a lot of videos that people may rememeber been there .
neutral	while i can '_t rate asda as a great supermarket , the entainment side of them seems to carry the lowest_prices of games i have seen on the internet so_far .
neutral	looking for a game to preorder ?
neutral	go to asda 0st !
neutral	web_site is easy to navigate , but parts need more cross_reference description such as manufacturers part number & better actual picture of item .
neutral	prices seem to be some of best found on internet , but you better know exactly_what part is needed because of no manufacturer number listed .
neutral	the partsgeek supply warehouse people seem to not know nothing about parts , just box numbers & are not able to check that right part is going out to customer .
neutral	i have ordered 0 times from partsgeek and 0 of them have been wrong or missing parts .
neutral	cannot get in touch with anyone by phone , only by support_ticket for customer service .
neutral	then , there is no return for wrong part sent from partsgeek at their expense when it '_s their mistake to start with .
neutral	how ridiculous is that ?
neutral	never_heard of a company doing that .
neutral	from here on , i would rather pay a little more at another site & get the right part and / or better customer service than deal with the frustration .
neutral	good luck !
neutral	i had shopped_around online for awhile and they had the best price by_far .
neutral	the associate was very nice .
neutral	townfair_tire still bothers_me that they advertise a " free front_end alignment " but basically force you to buy a 0 wheel_alignment .
neutral	every time i go , ( 0rd time now ) the associates tell me a front_end alignment is useless , that all 0 wheels should be aligned .
neutral	so townfair , stop advertising a free alignment if your company policy is to only do a 0 wheel_alignment .
neutral	be honest !
neutral	people will appreciate it more .
neutral	i have purchased 0 0 - wheelers and on both_occasions the units were shipped in a very timely_manner but both units were received with some damage . the first unit was a 000 cc coolsport and the damage was very minimal and consisted of just some paint scratched off the main body but the second unit was a 000 cc coolsport and the right fender of it was cracked from top to bottom and continued to crack after i took ownership . now after only 0_weeks of ownership of the 000cc the clutch has_been determined as faulty and i reported it and a gentleman by the name of lance tyler has_been very helpful in getting this issue corrected . i have currently filed a warranty claim but my 0 - wheeler has_been sitting idle for close to 0_weeks and still no clutch assembly has_been shipped and i feel that this process is taking to long so in closing i would rate the sales as excellent , the shipping as mediocre at best only because of the damage , the help_desk as excellent , and my thoughts on the service department are still up in the air but dwindling with each passing day .
neutral	easy to use and saw listing that didn_'_t pop_up on other travel sites .
neutral	my only question is how the hotel will treat this once we arrive ... will they give us one of their less desirable rooms and treat us like second class guests or will we be treated as if we paid full price .
neutral	we '_ll see ....
neutral	i recieved the muffler / pipes intact but with some dents .
neutral	the body of the muffler was wrapped in thin bubble_wrap , the pipes were exposed , the manifold end was sealed with tape but the exhaust end was open .
neutral	more care needs to be taken in prepping the parts for shipping .
neutral	one exhaust tip was bent , i was able to bend the pipe back into place with pliers , but should not have to on a new part .
neutral	aftermarket support is garbage

neutral	unfortunately your ink_cartridges did not work in my new epson_printer ... what a bummer .
neutral	i called and chatted with a reps to make_sure i put them incorrectly before installing them .
neutral	called back twice and chatted with two folk and they said they would be mailing out a return_label to cover shipping_charges .
neutral	i still have not received them .... help !
neutral	thks

neutral	this is the longest you have taken to get my part !
neutral	!
neutral	it took a eternity to go from one way to anothert .
neutral	maybe you can do the tripp both_ways
neutral	when i order my uk light cannon the website stated that items are in stock so i thought great .
neutral	bargain price and option for next_day delivery at a cost of £ 0 again bargain so bought said item paid for straight_away i received a email_stating item would be dispatched in 0 - 0 days so at the next available opportunity i phoned deep_blue and a polite lad on the phone said sorry item not in stock we have to order in fair enough he then said you would not have got it next_day delivery anyway as to have it delivered on a sat would have cost a extra £_00 but nowhere on the site was this mentioned i asked for a refund of my delivery charge to which the reply came " cor if you want it " personally i think its false_advertising and they need to update stock on website good job i wasn_'_t in a hurry for the light is all i can say but the light is amazing
neutral	got a great deal at a 0 * hotel in orlando , but did not like the additional $_00 / day in parking and resort_fees added daily .
neutral	i know that the fine_print says that you must pay hotel fees , but fees totaling 00_% of your bid price seems very excessive .
neutral	when priceline knows these fees are there , they really need to build it into the bid price , so that customers know the true price of the room , not an artificially reduced price .
neutral	process works great .
neutral	parts order , billing , shipping , tracking , comformation .
neutral	not happy with the fact that i ordered the correct parts , was sent the wrong parts
neutral	and i still had to pay for return shipping and restocking_fee which caused me to go elsewhere to get correct parts .
neutral	i had paid for the car_rental ahead of time at a good rate with my debit_card .
neutral	at the national auto rental facility the customer representative told me that my debit_card does not cover auto insurance and we would have to buy it .
neutral	it cost us $_000 . 00 for 0 days with $ 0000 . 00 deductible .
neutral	i pay $_000 . 00 more to cover two cars for a year with my auto insurance .
neutral	the woman would not let us switch to a credit_card or redo the rental transaction .
neutral	otherwise the car was fine and when we returned the car it was speedy and friendly .
neutral	thank_you for listening .
neutral	the part does not fit , even_though the order was placed properly .
neutral	i ' taking it to my certified bmw technician for help .
neutral	we '_ll contact you from his shop .

neutral	i was turned on to partsgeek . com while shopping for parts .
neutral	the prices are some of the best i '_ve_seen .
neutral	i '_ve order several items and for the most part have been pleased with the fast shipping .
neutral	what i have a problem with is the customer service or shall i say the attempt to reach a customer service rep .
neutral	when i have emailed , the 00 - 00hrs that i '_m guarenteed to be answered in has_been more like 0 - 0 days .
neutral	and you can forget calling parts_geek ....
neutral	they put you on hold for upwards to 00min and then tell you that they are experiencing_high call_volume .
neutral	and i '_m talking_about calling in the middle of the day , i '_m talking_about calling right at 0am est as soon as they open .
neutral	parts_geek is great unless you need customer service !
neutral	the online experience was a bit frustrating .
neutral	i ordered the unit a few weeks in advance , and then a week_later got a call about my reservation expiring .
neutral	i was able to renew it , but why was there a need >
neutral	also , the need to do everything in person is frustrating , why not find a way to take my credit_card information to make a reservation more firm ?
neutral	once that was out of the way , the unit itself was fine ...
neutral	the facility is ok . not as clean as i would like but is a storage_unit after all .
neutral	my big problem is the fee .
neutral	it was raised this year by about 00 bucks which is about 0 %.
neutral	as soon as i can get a place for my stuff i am outta there .
neutral	seems like a good reputable_company , the trouble i had was trying to place an order .
neutral	i could only get so_far on their website and i would get , " your order is being_processed and will be despatched as soon as possible ", which_meant i had to go back to the start because i had not put in any financial details which they hadn_'_t asked for , this happened very several_times until i had success !!!!!
neutral	!
neutral	having a pre_- made order schedule is convenient , however usually the food all arrives in one very heavy box that is falling_apart by the time it reaches my house .
neutral	it is too heavy for my wife to pick_up and sometimes has to stay out in the elements all day .
neutral	i '_m sure they ' re trying to reduce shipping_costs but there has to be a better way to reduce package weight .
neutral	i got my son '_s controller in the mail , the color on the website was a lighter pink , it showed_up hot pink and i ordered 0 colors around the x and only 0 show up .
neutral	i either want a new one the way i ordered it or money back .
neutral	thank_you .
neutral	otherwise quick delivery turn_around time .
neutral	parts worked great .
neutral	problem is that they sat at the ups warehouse all weekend after they got into my hometown at 0 friday_morning .
neutral	set me back 0 days .
neutral	hardly anything new and just seems like a waste of time with all the minutia .
neutral	rather just get an_email
neutral	i have purchased three bathrooms and 0 vertical radiators from bathempire the products are 0_stars the sales_team are 0_star , however the customer team are poor and the delivery courier are shocking , in summary don_'_t hesitate to buy the products , however beware of the delivery service don_'_t expect anymore than drop and run ,
neutral	i would rate them as an average vendor - not bad , not good .
neutral	the site works very well for the intended purpose of delivering / picking_up food .
neutral	i wish they had more restaurants in the area .
neutral	sometimes it seems like everything is pizza , indian , or chinese food .
neutral	i also want more restaurants near me to offer pickup as an option to avoid delivery fees .
neutral	jeg_bestilte_en computer fra noget tid siden , også skrev jeg og klagede over at det_tog så lang_tid også blev mig_og en_af medarbejderne så enige om at de_ville sende den i torsdags .
neutral	men_så skrev jeg til_dem i fredags at jeg_ikke_havde_fået nogen mail om at den_var_blevet sendt , og_det_var så fordi den ikke_var_blevet sendt .
neutral	også skrev en_anden medarbejder derinde fra , at den ville_blive sendt i går også ville de betale ekstra for lørdagsomdeling , men den_er stadig_ikke kommet og_har heller_ikke fået nogen mail om den endnu .

neutral	due to apparent sporadic it issues could not get web_page to select item and had to make several_attempts at placing order and send couple of emails to customer_services / info but eventually the website would allow me to place the order and go to the basket and complete order .
neutral	some great deals and value for money , but bad support from wowcher team when deal does not work
neutral	the delivery service and helpfulness is great .
neutral	goods arrived as_described and promptly .
neutral	my problem is really of my own making .
neutral	having placed a couple of orders i noticed on an_email they offered me 00_%_discount on subsequent purchases .
neutral	i immediately emailed them rather_than try and cancel the order .
neutral	they replied that they were unable to apply the discount to my order retrospectively - why not ?
neutral	this is very disappointing customer service .
neutral	in comparison my experience with another purchase at the same time from a different company - the day after i ordered an item they reduced it '_s price .
neutral	i sent an_email query .
neutral	they replied promptly and refunded the difference .
neutral	unfortunately , overboard don_'_t sell light_bulbs

neutral	the service was very poor , not happy at all , still no order arrived even after paying for express delivery , phoned and got fobbed of with excuse about ticket numbers , then guy said item was delivered in june i only ordered december_00th was told posted for next_day , no tracking details could be fond with info given , really disatisfied with this company and would never use again .
neutral	after a few_days of waiting my order was sorted , hope to receive it tuesday fingers_crossed , give credit to company for refunding postage_costs , so not as bad as first thought .
neutral	pricing seemed fair compared to other_sites and i '_m happy you had stock of an otherwise hard to find product , but your shipping_costs are excessive and shipping so_far has_been slow .
neutral	i gave you my eye care professionals number to cheek on my prescription but apparently it is not correct .
neutral	please call me to help rectify this error .

neutral	000 - 000 - 0000
neutral	they had the part that i needed and at a very good price .
neutral	however , i was not totally sure it was the correct part and i wanted to talk to someone about it .
neutral	but they did not post a telephone_number to call and all communication could only be done via_e_-_mail .
neutral	that may be alright for the younger generation of today , but us of the older generation i still remember and prefer to speak to a real live_person and get an immediate_response to a question , rather_than waiting 00 to 00_hours for an e_-_mail response ..
neutral	that '_s just the way i had always had done things in the past and prefer to use the speaking voice that i was born with .
neutral	i guess i '_m too used to old fashion socialization .

neutral	great price and service from merlin but the ukmail deliverey really lets them down , merlin posted my order on the same day but it took ukmail over a week to get it to me despite_being sent next_day
neutral	i ordered a bag of 00 inch bully_sticks .
neutral	there were 00 - 00 sticks in the bag but not all of them were 00 inches .
neutral	in fact about 0 / 0 of the sticks were 0 - 00 inches long .
neutral	many were also very small in diameter .
neutral	i was not expecting so many very thin sticks .
neutral	the thin sticks are chewed very quickly .
neutral	delivery was fairly accurate but by no means so straight_forward .
neutral	very need to ensure they have the most current electoral roll list !
neutral	i was unable to find my current address as they still had the records for the old name of address !
neutral	baring in mind we '_ve lived at our current address over 0 years !
neutral	i didn_'_t want to risk selecting the old name of address for the delivery option so i decided to have my good delivered to my grandparents address as that was accurate .
neutral	there is no facility to manually enter your address in .
neutral	that was my only_niggle with very the rest of the services was great .

neutral	i recently_purchased a radio replacement for my 0000_camaro , i was very excited to receive it and had it installed by the local gm dealer .
neutral	the installation cost was 00 . 00 , the problem was the push_button on / off button did not work and the radio stayed on constsantly .
neutral	i then had the radio removed for a cost of 00 . 00 and returned the radio after getting a return # from parts_geek , it has_been 00 days and i have heard_nothing .
neutral	so of course i am not happy with this return process .
neutral	i got the delivery of my part fast and accurate parts delivered in excellent condition .
neutral	but i have not have any communication from the time of confirming my order till the delivery of the order .
neutral	i did not receive any order confirmation_email , did not receive any tracking_information email .
neutral	i have tried_contacting the company thru the preferred method but nobody from geekparts replied to me thru phone or email .
neutral	if the person_who packed this grille is still working there , you better install a camera
neutral	i was amazed the delicate plastic grille made it to my house without getting crushed !
neutral	.
neutral	there was so little packing
neutral	i have recently_moved but i changed my address on the gooddens . com website before placing my order .
neutral	i also used my new address as the ship to and credit_card reference address and my package still shipped to my old address .
neutral	no one was able to tell me why .
neutral	i have my mail forwarded and the tracking_number said it would be forwarded so i waited .
neutral	after 0 days i called the post_office and they said even with the forward it kept coming_back to them at my old address .
neutral	i ended_up taking the 00 mile_round_trip to my old post_office to pick_up my package because i didn_'_t want to wait the 00 days for the post_office to send it back then have it re - shipped to the right address .
neutral	ordered 0items but got an an_email 0 days_later saying two were out of stock .
neutral	reordered and items delivered after another few_days
neutral	i shop regularly .
neutral	enjoy the options but sometime wishthere were more ooptions
neutral	delivery took too_long , yet i never got a tracking_number and was frustratingly never able to speak to a customer service rep .
neutral	i had spoken on the phone to a " parts_geek " order taker on a tuesday .
neutral	i needed the part quickly , however that part was to be shipped from a warehouse that only offered ups delivery - no alternative .
neutral	the order taker said it might arrive on the coming thursday , but probably friday .
neutral	i decided that would be acceptable so i placed the order .
neutral	quickly i got an_email that said the order had been processed ... but no tracking_number .
neutral	it didn_'_t show up on thursday or friday ; in fact not until the following_wednesday did it arrive .
neutral	a very frustrating experience .
neutral	i began calling and writing emails to find out the status on friday when it did not arrive and i had no way of tracking its status .
neutral	no one would ever answer the phone .
neutral	all i ever got was a return email that said they ' d received my request and would respond in 00 to 00_hours - which they never did - but with no information .
neutral	i finally got an_email at 00 : 00 on wednesday , 0 days after order , stating that it would be delivered by 00 : 00 on wednesday .
neutral	i got the email after it was delivered .
neutral	i was without my car for over a week , and frustrated by the black_hole customer service policy .
neutral	good news is , the part was fine .
neutral	bad_news is , i would not go back to parts_geek .
neutral	the tour is the typical essential thing to do when you are a tourist in a huge city like london .
neutral	the buses were new and the speaking guide very complete .
neutral	in my opinion , bbt sould improve two things : the timnetable ( 0 pm is too soon ) and the air_conditioning : we were dying because of the heat !
neutral	i buy lots of equipment from mf athletic .
neutral	i love the selection , they have quality products , but i do feel the items are overpriced and that as a repeat and regular customer that spends lots of money on equipment i don_'_t feel appreciated .
neutral	i see no advantage to buying from mf athletic versus going somewhere_else for future_purchases .
neutral	there are also times where the website won_'_t cooperate and is slow to respond ... to the point where i wasn_'_t able to place orders .
neutral	i had to either order later or go elsewhere .
neutral	i wanted two queen_beds , but the operator gave_me other options that i wasn_'_t interested in to start .
neutral	he found a good option , but it took_longer_than i expected and his computer was very slow .
neutral	i have had some success with finding books , but the condition guidelines are not always accurate .
neutral	i have received ex - library materials not marked as such and books that should have dust jackets that do not .
neutral	in addition , the packaging of the books for shipment is truly horrendous .
neutral	the books are packaged in plastic_bags with no care that the postal service damages the books in shipment .
neutral	great prices aren_'_t really that great if the books arrive looking as if they fell out of the airplane on the way over .
neutral	as a collector , shopping with this company is definitely hit or miss .
neutral	unfortunately , this is due mainly to the inadequate listing and shipping procedures .
neutral	if the condition of your books is important , shop elsewhere .
neutral	the first time i ordered was great , this time my credit_card was charged no e_mails on anything and i do not know where to follow_up .
neutral	the " johnsons parrot bumper treat bell " was difficult to track down on the website .
neutral	they are normally called simply ' seed bells .
neutral	if that descriprion was accepted in the search field it would make finding it less of a hassle .
neutral	( hassle = shop elsewhere to many people ) np to note
neutral	for the braces i bought the prices were up to a 0 / 0 lower_than anywhere_else i found them .
neutral	given the savings i decided to get the 0 day shipping to speed up my project a little .
neutral	at that point everything got a little rocky .
neutral	upon confirmation i found that the parts would be packed for shipping anywhere in a 0 day period and then the 0 days would for transit would take place from that point .
neutral	this was a little unnerving because it meant that , although i ordered on a sunday_night , i might not get my parts until monday the following week .
neutral	it is clearly_stated on the architectural depot website that you may call them about time sensitive orders .
neutral	however , this meant taking time out of my workday to call them .
neutral	that said , i received a shipping confirmation_email a couple days_later that the parts had shipped on monday and i got them the next thursday .
neutral	this was good but when i opened the box i found the parts had been packed very loosely and in contact with each other .
neutral	this led to some rubbing that i can brush out fairly easily .
neutral	fortunately , despite the lack of separation by even a little paper between some of the parts , nothing was dented or marred only scuffed .
neutral	they are already installed and i '_m happy with the product so_far .
neutral	two chairs were ordered for next_day delivery .
neutral	however they were despatched on a slower service and the explenation from the company was that the delivery time changed because we ordered two chairs rather_than one .
neutral	have never come_across this before , when i have paid_extra for next_day delivery , so won_'_t be ordering from this company again .
neutral	site has excellent prices , but they need to offer the free shipping over $_000 like its been in the past .
neutral	not bad service but did take time for payment process
neutral	as i went through the steps of installing this new windows 0000 program on my computer , i was struck by the thought that this would have been so much_easier if i had been sent a disc that i could just upload rather_than trying to find a system on my computer that is large enough to hold and be used to open this program .
neutral	as it is , i can open the windows program but i still get the 0000 version .
neutral	the 0000 has_been downloaded but finding it is something else .
neutral	for the cost of this , i would think that you would just send a disc .
neutral	everything has_been great with the following one major exception .
neutral	my scheduled recurring order always ships from new england and arrives in one day to me in upstate new_york .
neutral	this has_been the case three shipments in a row .
neutral	this has developed customer expectation that when one in my location receives a shipping notice , their pets will have food in one more day .
neutral	my last recurring order , however , shipped from nv without_any specific notice to me other than the usual provided tracking_info .
neutral	yes , i could have checked the tracking_info , but who has time to do so ?
neutral	my reason for using automated recurring internet shipments is because i don_'_t have time to check up on and micro manage these things .
neutral	so , i was very frustrated when i received my shipping notification , assumed the food would arrive the next_day , and was left with no animal food several days_later .
neutral	of course , when i went online and checked , i realized the issue and went to the pet_store to get food .
neutral	but that completely defeats the purpose of me doing my pet_food shopping this way .
neutral	now i have no_idea what to expect with the next shipment , so i am unsure_whether or not i will_continue the service .
neutral	i have found several restaurants in my travels -- or should i say not found -- because they no_longer existed .
neutral	i don_'_t know if it '_s possible , but i ' d like to know if reviewed restaurants are / not opened currently before i spend time seeking them out .
neutral	other than this i enjoy writing for and using trip_advisor to find new places .
neutral	on the flip side i have found several great eating places over the last few_years using your service .
neutral	no_problems here
neutral	i purchased a cat converter that did not look like the picture i received .
neutral	when email my concern i was emailed back and told that a supervisor would get back to me .
neutral	well no one got back to me and had to use the damaged part to past my inspection .
neutral	my first purchase was perfect .
neutral	now i don_'_t know .
neutral	i like the value and convenience petflow provides , but they really must do a better job of notifying_me when a shipment is coming up .
neutral	with shipments several months apart , i can '_t stay on top of them and often end up with food i don_'_t need .
neutral	this somewhat negates the value and provenience the service otherwise provides .
neutral	the plaque actual turned_out very nicely , but i was unable to use it at the cemetary for the purpose of which it was meant .
neutral	my dog_loves the bully_sticks and the snap bits .
neutral	and , although he also loves the herring formula " evo wild cravings " the product inside the package looked like it had been hit with a sludge hammer .
neutral	only about 0 / 0 of the contents were whole ..
neutral	the rest of the product in the package were very small bits and dust .
neutral	kind of a waste of my money .
neutral	i hate that .
neutral	they are one of the fastest on the web to get parts to you on a timely_basis but there is absolutely no phone # to call if you have a problem .
neutral	on my first order , they shipped me the wrong part and there was no option to do a simple exchange .
neutral	i had to send the old part in ( am still_waiting for the refund ) and then re - order the correct part .
neutral	it seems that simple customer service call to them ( but i had no phone ) would have made things so much_easier .
neutral	some of these bars are 0 years expired !?
neutral	and they ' re still a dollar or even more a piece ?!
neutral	ok , i '_ll buy them , but at_least give free shipping !
neutral	i '_ll be looking out for the promo_codes .....
neutral	cool concept .
neutral	they charged me twice for the same order .
neutral	i called customer service , and got hung_up on 0 times .
neutral	i e_- mailed customer bla , bla three_days latter i got a response .
neutral	they did not know what the hell was going on ???
neutral	it '_s been two_weeks now and the money is still not back on my card ???
neutral	soooo other then paying double for my part it was all great ???
neutral	i guess ??
neutral	?
neutral	gettin the picture to fit on the card was a challenge .
neutral	i ' d suggest more cropping and sizing capabilities .
neutral	also , the image would move after getting to checkout .
neutral	i almost gave up on the whole thing but it ended_up working on my 0th try .
neutral	overall very cool concept though .
neutral	thank_you !
neutral	product good , price good .
neutral	but no communication slow shipping and no tracking_# provided .
neutral	too many trips to ups to pick_up parts
neutral	would buy again from this website if the shipping_charges is free .
neutral	the only draw_back from partsgeek is other_websites offer free shipping if you buy a minimum charges ( e . g_., $_00 -$_000 ).
neutral	partsgeek doesn_'_t offer this feature .
neutral	i am still_waiting for a return tag and the correct part to be delivered ..
neutral	it has only been a week but i really need that part ..
neutral	the prices are great and the responce time to any questions is excellant .
neutral	iu recieved the wrong part ( one of two ) because the pachage was misslabeled by the manufacturer , so this is not partsgeeks fault and they seem to be trying to resolve it ..
neutral	the motor on the window regualator was wired wrong . thank_you
neutral	russell e . loness
neutral	after deciding to use whisky online i wassurprised that minimal account details were forthcoming on my order .
neutral	subsequently i discovered ( after chasing it myself ) that they had sent my order to the wrong_address ) that their system was up to date , i had to chase it again .
neutral	seems they have a single contact / admin point who has to rectify all issues .
neutral	this lady did do so eventually .....
neutral	having said that the bottle did arrive safe and sound - but very late .... beware
neutral	perhaps i was unfortunate to have my tyres at a time when the fitting_centre was extremely busy .
neutral	i think the job went ok but attention to detail and customer requests could be improved .
neutral	left fitting_centre without feeling a valued_customer .
neutral	overall though the job was satisfacory .
neutral	i '_ve stayed here before and the hotel was great .
neutral	this time it was not so great .
neutral	the picture on the tv was very snowy and most channels were unwatchable , and the faucets leaked and the tile was cracked in several placed in the bathroom .
neutral	the staff however was great when i needed something they were all about making my stay good .
neutral	older hotel needs updated but this is the only bad_experience in 0 stays here .
neutral	the flowers were there on arrival , not exactly the wow_factor , vase was cheap looking .
neutral	i can understand the flowers not being open which will allow them to last longer but they looked dull and really just green .
neutral	if that was their best seller then there must be a few disapointed customers , the flowers were ok but just ok .
neutral	they looked like the hotel had done the room ready for the next guest and simply added them to the room .
neutral	i had no_issues with the service , i wish it would have been a climate_controlled enviorment .
neutral	it was easy to get on line and pay the bill , very user_friendly .
neutral	the service did not provise a military_discount .
neutral	lastly one i moved out of the storage i received a final_bill for 00 . 00 $.
neutral	there was no_explanation as to why i received those charges and that was not what was explained when i initially got the storage_unit .
neutral	i paid in full every month so im not sure why i got this charge that cant be explained to me .
neutral	would it not be easier to provide core_return information and a return shipping_label with the part .
neutral	as the part has to be returned in 00 days or less , it is a time sensitive matter .
neutral	i attempted to go to your site to request a rma_number and it advised that portion of the site was down .
neutral	this may be a deal_breaker on any future orders .
neutral	we had a good experience with budget a couple of years_ago which is why we returned last_year but we were a little let_down on our last trip .
neutral	we paid the extra for the initial full_tank of petrol thinking that we would be able to return the car with the tank not full as our previous visit - not so .
neutral	we also found that the automatic toll payment had been left on so that we were charged £_00 for a $ 0 toll that was automatically charged and couldn_'_t be refunded .
neutral	disappointing .
neutral	it was good in terms of product quality , but i didn_'_t really like the fact that they wouldn_'_t refund delivery when sending back a product for being too small , and expected me to pay the delivery back to them , for a £_00 product , it cost me £_00 total in delivery and returns .
neutral	this is a reliable company to order from and the site is well layed_out .
neutral	well bedworld have my money , but i do not have my bed yet .
neutral	i chose them as the website seems to suggest the longest time you wait is a few_days and that many beds are next_day delivery .
neutral	after 0 days i did get something , a call to say the bed was probably not available for at_least 0_weeks .
neutral	it may get here sooner , but can '_t be sure .
neutral	as of yet i have no firm date as to when i '_ll get the bed , so not sure why i '_m being asked to leave_feedback just yet .
neutral	i '_ll let you know how it turns_out .
neutral	.
neutral	.
neutral	good delivery & prices but poor system for password recovery .
neutral	did not reply to e_-_mails
neutral	after e_bay acknowledging the order nothing heard for three_days when a " your order has_been despatched " e_mail arrived .
neutral	prior to this an e_-_mail was unacknowledged and a phone_call unanswered .
neutral	left feeling in limbo until the first contact and goods arrived fine next_day despite 0nd_class delivery postage .
neutral	compared to recent_purchases with other_sources diy tools need to be more communicative
neutral	while the price initially of renting a car is competitive the practice of paying for a full_tank of fuel ( which you may not use ) up front at exorbitant rates per_litre and return as empty as possible is a rather devious means of increasing the overall price of the rental .
neutral	the boxed package was left outside in the pouring_rain .
neutral	the package had either been crushed on a sharp object , been dropped , or had something dropped on it .
neutral	i say this because both packing boxes had holes in , and the guitars hard case also had a corresponding hole in it ....... thankfully , the guitar was saved from damage .
neutral	to return the damaged case , i know have to take a day off work to wait in all day for a courier to take the case back .
neutral	everything was fine apart_from the length of time it took for them to send the cheque .
neutral	i '_ve sold phones before online with various other_companies and i usually get the cheque within a few_days .
neutral	after waiting about 0 days for envirofone to tell me my phone had been tested and was fine they then told me they would send the cheque out in a weeks time !
neutral	adding on the 0 days to clear a cheque it was a long wait !
neutral	the price of the bolts is good and the selection is great , but shipping is crazy !
neutral	use priority flat_rate boxes and charge post_office prices for shipping .
neutral	personnel at waverly station in edinburgh very helpful .
neutral	our singular complaint is that , despite our reservation , the type of car for which we had contracted and prepaid , was not available at check - in .
neutral	we were forced to upgrade to premium level to assure an automatic_transmission and , thus , to incur significant additional expense .
neutral	in this sense , eurocar did not meet the commitment to provide the vehicle indicated on our reservation .
neutral	this felt a bit like a " bait and switch " strategy with the upgraded expense unfairly becoming our responsibility .
neutral	this , for us , diminished the strong reputation of eurocar to honor its commitments .
neutral	in terms of price wise , the service is okay , however the shuttle service has a lot of rooms for improvements .
neutral	the drivers were not rude , but were not nice either .
neutral	also , on pick_up day , i had to wait for 00 + minutes while other shuttle_buses come and go 0 - 0 + times .
neutral	i even called in advance just to make_sure i do not wait for too_long , but it did not help .
neutral	i had to call three_times and this made me very frustrating .
neutral	please make purchase limits clearer when adding items to cart
neutral	you can get good customer service and delivery if you do not wish to venture outside .
neutral	however , the high_street prices in comparison are often much_cheaper .
neutral	unfortunatley what i asked for did not fit , so i am stuck with the part .
neutral	if i had gone to a local_supplier i could have got my money back with out the hassle and expence of returning it .
neutral	i put it down to a live and learn experience .
neutral	bummer .
neutral	good product but shipping is too high .
neutral	. m
neutral	i ordered a simple pair of rubber gloves to assist putting on my compression_stockings .
neutral	the order was placed on march_00th but it took over 0_weeks ( finally delivered april_00th ) to receive them .
neutral	this is not the kind of customer service that impresses me .
neutral	the order is really taking a long time ... will be very glad when it arrives ...
neutral	the site is very easy to use .
neutral	you enter the type of lenses you usually order from your optician and the site recommends which lenses to buy from them .
neutral	i used to buy my lenses from spec savers , though the ones i get from lenstore are more comfortable and they are a lot cheaper and they arrived through the door the day after i ordered them !
neutral	love the hemp_protein but i can '_t justify spending that much on it consistently .
neutral	got the product i needed but very slow shippig
neutral	i was pleased with the product delivery could gave been faster .
neutral	ordered on 0 april .
neutral	confirmation said contact company if not received in 00_hours ( business days ).
neutral	did so and was told it '_s now 0 - 0 days .
neutral	fedex said 0 - 00 days .
neutral	it '_s now 00 days latter and still not here .
neutral	die tatsache , dass einem per vertrag die prepaid fuel option aufgezwungen wird , ist an der grenze des zumutbaren !
neutral	the only problem i had was the cats would not eat the food , they would rather have the cheap in some_cases from the box stores .
neutral	at $_00 . 00 for a bag that you would only have to lay_out $_00 . 00 for , is bad if they don_'_t like it .
neutral	let_me say i had a real problem with the first shipment , check my record of purchase .
neutral	but the customer service person took charge and did what any good company would do , is make it right no matter what .
neutral	it still end this way , if the pets won_'_t eat it , i don_'_t want it .
neutral	i wish to thank_you for the concern , and wish you a happy thanksgiving .
neutral	duane
neutral	i really like this snugg in every way except for the fact that it doesn_'_t have the magnet this automatically shuts of the ipad when you close the cover .
neutral	it would have been perfect
neutral	the hinges on the lid of a plastic fuse holder i ordered for a 0000_vw_golf were broken -- both of them -- but i really needed to get the car up and running so i didn_'_t want to wait any longer for a replacement .
neutral	that fuse holder lid is also secured in place by two clips ; the hinges really do nothing more that prevent the lid from failing into the engine compartment when the holder is opened .
neutral	i can '_t see how the part was damaged during shipping .
neutral	there was plenty of packing_material in the box .
neutral	i suspect that the part i ordered wasn_'_t carefully inspected before it was sent out .
neutral	i found a good deal on auto_europe , and in the end everything worked out .
neutral	the only problem was that my " deal " left off an airport tax that was almost the same amount as the cost of the entire booking .
neutral	it is also kind of a pain to have to print out the voucher and bring it to the airport .
neutral	probably wouldn_'_t use auto_europe again .
neutral	mail order trees go on and on about how they '_ll almost undoubtedly deliver your trees so much sooner_than the stated delivery time .
neutral	so , i waited with bated breath ... and the trees finally turned_up at the very last_minute to be within the stated delivery period .
neutral	not only that , they were just left in the front garden .
neutral	i was in the house at the time and nobody rang the doorbell to tel me they were making a delivery , it was only when i was going out a bit later that i discovered some very large packages plonked in the front garden .
neutral	the trees themselves are in very good condition , that part is fine .
neutral	i ordered a lavender plant as a gift and based on the information found on the website , i expected it to ship within a couple days .
neutral	after 00 days i inquired_about the status of my order and was told it would ship in a couple days .
neutral	after a week i inquired again about the status of my order and was told " we have some but they are very small .
neutral	we want it to grow before sending to you .
neutral	are you ok with us holding a little_longer ?
neutral	if not i can refund you ."
neutral	after i asked how much longer they would like to keep before sending i was told " we are hoping just a few more weeks ."
neutral	since it had now been 0_weeks since i placed the order , i asked for a refund .
neutral	after asking for a refund , then all of a sudden it was ok for them to ship the plant .
neutral	then 0 days_later i received a shipping confirmation .
neutral	so in summary , order was placed on may 0th and finally shipped on june 0nd .
neutral	i picked baymont at charlotte airport because you and baymont advertised a shuttle to the airport on demand and i knew i would be running on a tight_schedule to get a 0 am flight .
neutral	i arrived at 0 : 00 am , asked for a ride to the airport , and was told the shuttle runs only at 00_minutes past the hour ... and you can only get on if you reserved the night before ... and passengers were limited to 0 per hour .
neutral	luckily , i got on the 0 : 00 am shuttle ( which arrived 00_minutes late ) and processed thru security with enough time to catch my flight .... but someone strictly relying on the advertised " on demand " shuttle could miss a flight easily as a result .
neutral	i was also a bit_concerned with the add - on processing fees which i learned about only after going thru all the forms and providing credit_card info .
neutral	in the end , things worked out ok for me , but i ' d suggest the advertising be changed to reflect reality so people can choose other_places to park if a more frequent or flexible shuttle may be needed .
neutral	the guy running the counter at baymont was understandably a bit less_than accommodating at first ( most people are groggy at 0 : 00 am ) but he warmed_up and was very helpful ; he should be commended .
neutral	the shuttle policy was not his fault .
neutral	hard to find stuff even with their search_engine .
neutral	you ask for a specific description and they serve up everything else as well .
neutral	very hard to navigate through hundreds of pages finding that one item you wanted to find with the search key .
neutral	also slow with shipping .
neutral	well , the only problem i had with the purchase was that my original order was for 0 items which were all in stock and in the end they only sent me 0 of the items without asking me if i wanted to wait for received the all package at once .
neutral	the rest went nice and smooth with this company .
neutral	i just hope they know send me the other 0 items without me having to pay for shipping expenses .
neutral	part fit and good price ... but can , t get anyone on phone ... on - line nice but you still need staff to take calls .. so hope they improve in that area
neutral	the website is real easy to navigate to find what you need .
neutral	parts all arrived in just a few_days .
neutral	however one item ( mirrors for a 0000_ford_f000 ) are listed under more than one part number and at_least two of the part numbers state that l brackets to mount he mirrors are included .
neutral	i have searched through my package very carefuly and there are no l brackets .
neutral	there is a fax_number listed on the packing_slip but no voice number .
neutral	i immediately faxed the packing_slip back with request for a phone_call to get the l brackets .
neutral	i '_m easy .
neutral	i don_'_t even mind_paying for the brackets but i would sure like a phone_call .
neutral	if i were to fault them on anything it would be : 0 ) the fact that they didn_'_t make it clear on the web_site that free shipping only applied from them to me and i would have to pay shipping on the core_return .
neutral	0 ) they were slow in crediting my credit_card for the core_charge once they had received the core back from me .
neutral	slow response , no immediate email reply or order confirmation . i thought there are some technical problems . ive got their email one week after i placed the order . no biggie but would be nice to have it earlier ..
neutral	don_'_t get me wrong i " probably " still will buy from zavvi . i just felt_cheated when the last time i had email with offer that if i leave review they will send me 00 procent discount .
neutral	yes they did send me voucher , and i was happy and choose products for almost 000 £ worth . and at the time i was about to proceed ," nope " it didn_'_t go . and the reason is -.. the items must be - rrp !!!
neutral	or original price
neutral	i was trying to find any but i couldn_'_t because all of them are discounted even new products . i felt_like a idiot . i lost interest to continue to make any purchases from zavvi .
neutral	only issue i have is that i asked by email to change the delivery address to a rep of ireland address .
neutral	whilst i appreciate that would not be free delivery like the uk , i would have expected a call to advise of the charge ahead of just putting it through .
neutral	happy with product , delivery etc .
neutral	thanks
neutral	i say it '_s only decent because i don_'_t think the grip last long enough .
neutral	you could have packed my skins in something alittle stronger than a shitty piece of paper with please do not bend written on it , my skin was crumpled .
neutral	customer service agent was able to identify the part quickly ( a small rubber grommet for the stove top ), told me they were $ 0 . 00 each and that it would cost $ 0 . 00 to ship them ( combined weight less_than 0 ounce ).
neutral	the parts arrived in a reasonable_amount of time and were the correct parts .
neutral	ordered the items , but they were sent to the wrong house number .
neutral	shima_uma were so quick between confirming the order and saying they ' d sent it , that i didn_'_t pick_up in time that it was going to the wrong house number .
neutral	as the house number doesn_'_t exist , just hoping that the royal_mail send it back ( rather_than trying to deliver it elsewhere ) and then shima_uma can send it to me .
neutral	so at the moment i '_ve paid for the goods , but thats it .
neutral	the part did not fit my car !
neutral	and the wait for someone to contact you back is sooooooo slow !
neutral	now i '_m doing the waiting game to see if they will let_me return the part .
neutral	i have been trying to return a couple of parts which i ordered incorrectly since oct 00st .
neutral	i have yet to receive proper required number and instructions for return although my continued requested have been ignored .
neutral	i bought a rim from the web_site and from the picture the price looked all too good to be true and to my findings when i got it i was right , but none the less it came fast and nothing was wrong with the rim just it wasn_'_t the right style , oh well nothing a little powder coating can '_t fix
neutral	very disappointed with the service .
neutral	nothing heard from time of order ( 00 feb ) until 0 minutes before delivery , when we received a call from the driver on his mobile .
neutral	were we expected to just sit in and wait every_single day and not do anything_else ?
neutral	the delivery company must have known at_least the day before that he was coming and could have emailed or sent a text .
neutral	very unprofessional .
neutral	under normal conditions boilerjuice works well and is always competitive .
neutral	it '_s when circumstances move outside the normal range e . g bad_weather or supply shortages that faceless boilerjuice loses its charm and you are left to the whim of the nominated supplier who does not rate you among their loyal_customers .
neutral	keep the good work - up boilerjuice but try to share some responsibility when things go_wrong .
neutral	the delivery was expensive but it was very quick , the product was advertised as a green river knife but i was disappointed when it arrived as it is a pretty cheap copy .
neutral	i did not need the motor
neutral	good site , easy to shop , very slow shipping .
neutral	ordered the chocolate flavour , it come reasonably quickly the downside is the taste , going for chocolate flavour i thought was a safe bet !
neutral	clearly not
neutral	ordered flowers and had confirmed delivery for mother '_s day , which was on a sunday .
neutral	the flowers did not arrive until monday_afternoon and were in a very bad state .
neutral	put in a complaint and was told that they don_'_t deliver on sunday and they were sorry about the poor quality of the flowers .
neutral	received a free bunch of flowers the next_day which were of very good quality and presentation .
neutral	i '_m satisfied that the company made an effort to rectify the problem , however it should have been right first time .
neutral	i ordered a part for my car , mechanics found the part to be for a manual , not a automatic_transmission .
neutral	ok easy mistake , but my car is down until i get the part replaced .
neutral	i had to file a support_ticket , which i prefer 0 - 000 # s , but the support_ticket said to give 00 - 00hrs for a response .
neutral	well 00hrs later i got a response on how to do an_rma which is great but not what i was trying to get done .
neutral	i told them in the support_ticket how important this is and that they respond asap , and that i needed to have the correct part overnighted and i ' d pay for it and we can figure_out the rma later because my priority is getting the car running because its my daily driver .
neutral	well i had to fill_out a support_ticket 0 more times trying to get them to resolve my issue and ill take_care of the rma later .
neutral	they never helped_me just kept sending me rma instructions like i can '_t read .
neutral	here it is almost a month since and my cars still not fixed .
neutral	thanks parts_geek , next time ill pay double the price in town and get it done in one day instead of one month .
neutral	accessrx gave_me a very good price on cialis , much less_than the local rite aid where i live , and the shipping was very fast , too .
neutral	on those 0 points , they were 0_stars .
neutral	however , the rep i spoke with about the order was another issue in itself .
neutral	he was impatient with me , not really taking sufficient time to answer my questions_regarding the ordering procedure , and considering i was a first time user , that was a problem .
neutral	i did later speak to the manager , bill , who really did an excellent job of clearing things up for me .
neutral	in summary , a more patient rep would have put my rating into 0 or 0_stars easily .
neutral	i think the process and delivery is great !!!
neutral	how ever the return_policy should be better , as a curtesy for using parts_geek they should send a return slip with the items if there is a core involved .
neutral	it also seems after_reading the policy the customer is fully responable for all and the company holds no responsibility for anything not to reassuring as a customer spending a lot of money .
neutral	ordered my d000 on line and was told to supply proof of address and then was told there was a problem with my cc .
neutral	the cc company said there was no problem , and eventually got my ordered passed .
neutral	really felt they were not keen to sell to me because i was overseas order with a large_amount .
neutral	i know you got to be_careful but this would put me off dealing again .
neutral	took me 0 days to get this ordered .
neutral	rang customer service the first time and he was very friendly but when i rang again he was less friendly " not you again " attitude .
neutral	eventually after ringing park_cameras and then cc company i got it sorted .
neutral	cameras was delivered next_day so couldnt_fault that .
neutral	also slow to answer emails unlike_other_companies .
neutral	wouldnt say to not deal with them but expect delays in ordering products that cost over € 0000 . 00 .
neutral	i have purchased numerous products and shipped numerous_times , and every_single time there has_been an issue .
neutral	once they sent me the wrong products after two_weeks .
neutral	the next time they sent me half my order and sent it to the wrong location .
neutral	we are talking_about a situation at faro_airport , portugal , oktober 0000 .
neutral	contacts with economycarrentals were 000_% ok .
neutral	but handling by interrent was very poor !!!
neutral	too much time lost .
neutral	pick_up at airport was unsufficient .
neutral	calling the office i was told to wait outside the airport .
neutral	however the guy from interrent was waiting inside ... after half an_hour i tried to call again .
neutral	telephone was not answered !!!
neutral	transport to interrent office only after one hour !!
neutral	!
neutral	car was 000_% ok .
neutral	system concerning fuel is not ok . handling at interrent office was unfriendly and took again a lot of time .
neutral	and returning the car took a lot of time as well ( 00_minutes ) because only 0 persons were present while waitng 00 other customers to return their car .
neutral	and all of them had to catch a plane !!!
neutral	all very very poor !!
neutral	!
neutral	first : when i got home i received another charge on my prepaid car_rental of $_00 . 00 .
neutral	when i checked the car out i was asked to sign a form ($_00 . 00 was on it ) and i asked what it was .
neutral	i was told it was simply verification that it was a daily fee .
neutral	now i find i was charged that amount .
neutral	this is the second time this has happened to me .
neutral	that '_s really bad .
neutral	i have no_idea why i was up - charged .
neutral	second : after some terrible weather i decided to have the car washed .
neutral	when it came out of the wash i looked it over and saw two terrible dents on the hood .
neutral	i , of course , thought somehow i had done it .
neutral	then , i looked on the paperwork i received and sure_enough , there were markings that there were two dents on the car hood .
neutral	honestly , why would that not have been mentioned to me when i got the car and why would i have been given a car damaged so badly ?
neutral	the car was filthy when i got it ( on the outside ) and was in a dark garage so i didn_'_t notice the dents then .
neutral	took to long to get picked_up at airport
neutral	we received our shipment of your coffe , while less_expensive , i don_'_t think the coffee is the same quality as the nespresso pod are .
neutral	while offering a good cup of coffee , i don_'_t think the quality is as good as the manufactures coffee .
neutral	not sure if i would buy again .
neutral	for just a little more money , i think you get a much_better quality from nespresso .
neutral	i have received invalid i - tunes redeem vouchers for the 0nd time in two years .
neutral	the process and procedure to have this corrected takes at_least 00_hours and is time_consuming and irritating .
neutral	i '_ve spent a fair amount of money at cult_pens .
neutral	the things have always arrived well_packed and quickly with the occasional freebie thrown in .
neutral	so why only 0_stars ?
neutral	i bought a pilot bamboo fountain_pen from them a few_years_ago , one of several quite expensive pens .
neutral	before too_long the top of the pen showed signs of cracking around the clip .
neutral	i phoned cult_pens , the chap i spoke too couldn_'_t have been more dismissive .
neutral	told me to contact pilot , he couldn_'_t get me off the phone quickly enough .
neutral	pilot pens were extremely unhelpful : saying they ' d get someone to call me etc .
neutral	eventually said that if i sent it to them , they would send it to japan for them to look at it .
neutral	told this to the manager of stationery world on park street in bristol .
neutral	he offered to sort it out with pilot himself .
neutral	said cult_pens would have a lot of clout with pilot and they could easily have helped , especially as they had sold me the pen .
neutral	stationery world sorted it out , pen returned in fine fettle with no charge , though pilot tried to charge .
neutral	stationery world told them neither they nor i would pay .
neutral	top_marks stationery world .
neutral	i ' d love to know what cult_pens thinks of this , but haven_'_t asked .
neutral	i still use cult_pens , but i '_m wary now .
neutral	i wish i knew what they think of this .
neutral	perhaps they '_ll contact me , or perhaps they don_'_t care that much .
neutral	andy '_s pens is good if you ' re a bit of an addict by the way .
neutral	i have no connection with any of the firms concerned other than as a customer
neutral	update .
neutral	spoke to cult_pens about their reply to let them know that i had in fact got back to them again while trying to get a response from pilot , but was told there was nothing they could do .
neutral	chap i spoke to today apologised and said that this kind of response would not be given to a customer again .
neutral	i really hope this is true .
neutral	please post your experience of any_problems .
neutral	i called to order a part on the phone and was on hold for two and a half hours .
neutral	eventually , i got tired of waiting for someone to answer , which i am quite sure would have never happened , and hung_up the phone !!!
neutral	i don_'_t like putting my credit_card number on internet transactions which was why i waited on hold so long .
neutral	i did so one other time and someone was trying to use my credit_card number to steal money from me by saying i was going to donate money to a fake charity , luckily the credit_card company called me to verify it .
neutral	i would not have been as reluctant if parts_geek belonged to paypal !!
neutral	get with the times there .
neutral	btw the part was delivered fast and worked_perfectly .
neutral	thanx .
neutral	jeff in ohio
neutral	i got my new tire after my other one was unrepairable .
neutral	i asked for them to rotate my tires after because it was 0000 miles since i got my tires but they didn_'_t .
neutral	not a long wait so overall it was an ok experience .
neutral	the price was good but to wait more than a week for a part that was in stock is just too_long to wait .
neutral	i am still_waiting on my order
neutral	dinner out deals are acceptable but accomodation deals are poor in availability and very difficult to book even after a couple of days after buying the voucher
neutral	i '_ve ordered a couple of times , first time , even_though it states " in stock " on the website it wasn_'_t in stock , when i called them up i got a real jobs worth that wasn_'_t going to help me at all and it was my fault that i wouldn_'_t get the products i ' d ordered on time etc .
neutral	i put this down to him having a bad day and called back and got someone_who helped_me out and i received my stuff on time , second time i ordered my stuff and it took five days to arrive but it was free_postage so i didn_'_t moan !!
neutral	as i said before , ok !
neutral	!
neutral	i will not comment until i receive my most resent order .
neutral	received order quickly ( one day ).
neutral	item did not come with mounting_screws as the picture depicted .
neutral	tried to contact customer service could not get through .
neutral	i even tried to order crews and could not get through on the phone .
neutral	i was hoping to purchase screws at a lower price than the dealer offered .
neutral	my order was for a plastic skid_plate , for an 00 audi_a0 quattro 0 . 0
neutral	i was seeking information by email without_any resolution and then by telephone which was constantly busy and i got hung_up on .
neutral	wow they rolled up a plastic fender into a ball , crushed and even broke the pins , it was like a someone must have sat on it before sealing box , just didnt want to feal with return , price and speed of delivery was very good .
neutral	web_site ok , easy to get around .
neutral	tried the " chat " service x0 and got no response , had to phone the ny number listed on the web_site .
neutral	fortunate to get a knowledgeable person .
neutral	paying shipping_charges to receive the product was expected but then turning around and having to pay to return it was pretty odd .
neutral	the only_thing that caused me to rate as high as i did was the fact that the initial delivery was very speedy .
neutral	i feel_like i got steered to the worst storage_unit at the facility .
neutral	of course , i didn_'_t realize until i had been using it for a couple weeks .
neutral	stuck right next to the exit , i can '_t pull up to my unit and unload from the back of my van or trailer into my unit .
neutral	i have to drag everything around from 0 units down .
neutral	just a pain in the ass .
neutral	can '_t believe you have the gall to charge full price for it .
neutral	it is obviously an undesirable unit .
neutral	i also felt mislead by your promotional advertising that i didn_'_t qualify for .
neutral	will be looking for alternatives you may be assured
neutral	i used all 0 magnets on a small plastic sign ( 00mm x 000mm ) the sign was then used on the rear of my car .
neutral	after the 0rd time i removed the sign the magents stayed on the car .
neutral	the adhesive backing needs to be stronger
neutral	this order took over 0 months to get , and the shark helmet cheek pads that were shipped will work , but they are the cheek pads for the newer style shark helmets and not as_described for the series 0 helmets but for the series 0 helmets , live and learn i will not be returning them shipping is to high across the pond but i will also not be ordering anything_else from the sportbikeshop .
neutral	i thought the tour could have been good but we got stuck in traffic too much .
neutral	the commentary was clear and you could hear it well enough .
neutral	also we got off after about six stops and didn_'_t get back on again as we ended_up sighseeing so didn_'_t get much value for the £_000 we paid .
neutral	but we did do the thames cruise , which was good .
neutral	i think it '_s a good tour but it '_s difficult to get value as you ' d have to stay on the bus , but people '_s plans_change as the day goes on .
neutral	maybe it could be cheaper for people who only use it for part of the day .
neutral	i have been satisfied with the overall service and delievery from lensstore .
neutral	i also think these are the most comfortable lenses that i have ever worn ( when thewy dont split ), i suffer from dry eyes and these lenses seem to be perfect from morning to late night .
neutral	the only_downside that i have experienced is three of the contact_lenses have split ( from a 00 day package ).
neutral	one actually split in my eye which was quite painful and not a good experience .
neutral	it took_longer_than usual to make the reservation due to my not always understanding the booking agent due to the rapidity of his speech and accent .
neutral	other than this problem it was okay but i would have rather spoken to someone at the clarion in shepherdstown .. a live_person didn_'_t answer the phone at this location and i couldn_'_t understand the voice_mail message .
neutral	mrs . steven d yoder
neutral	good range but expensive and bloody awful customer service
neutral	i wish the site was easier to navigate and a little easier on the eyes .
neutral	also , why do i always get errors when i put information in correctly ?
neutral	it seems to me criminals take no time off .
neutral	why on earth would an identity security company take time off .
neutral	i signed_up for this service to be protected against threats .
neutral	so i get a notice on my smart phone of a possible problem , can i find out what that problem is when i hear about it .
neutral	no i can '_t .
neutral	i have to wait to get home to my computer , all the while worried_about the danger of having my identity stolen .
neutral	maybe it '_s just me but can anyone_else see the flaws with this service .
neutral	i hope this allows someone do make this potentially great service work in the real world of being busy and away from home at work
neutral	i used the easter special_offer but found with the 00_%_discount i could still get cheaper directly from the parking company '_s site .
neutral	thought the 00 day free month was a great offer until they expected full next months payment by the 0 week in .
neutral	kept bugging about it via_email and phone .
neutral	i spoke to management and mentioned my free 00 days and they said yes well , they expect next months payment a week in advance so if my stuff was not out by end of 0rd week , i would be charged the full next month .
neutral	if you need a full 00 days , you may want to pass on this deal .
neutral	all in all , good however the representative that i spoke with did argue with me that the nissan_titan & nissan armada don_'_t use the same mirrors .
neutral	i gave up trying to convince her that they were the same .
neutral	so in the end i accepted the refund and had to do_business somewhere_else .
neutral	your phone system is terrible .
neutral	i have called several_times only to be put on hold for 00 - 00_minutes and then i get cut_off .
neutral	also , i am trying to return / exchange a part i purchased , ( which is why i called in the first place ) and i have a ticket number and no one has contacted my yet .
neutral	i received my ticket number on sept . 0th .
neutral	my ticket number is 000000 .
neutral	in a prior dealing_with parts_geek , i received the incorrect part , your team replaced it however , i was charged shipping on the return part .
neutral	if it was not my mistake why would i get charged shipping ?
neutral	otherwise , i like the quality of the parts and the prices .
neutral	ordering is very convenient and shipping out is quick and efficient .
neutral	starfire did not send the aqua glass with the table i was suppose to receive with the purchase .
neutral	i even noticed on the invoice ( before shipment ) it was not on there , so i called and he corrected invoice to reflect .
neutral	then when i got the table it still was not with the table .
neutral	i had to call back 0 more times to get it corrected .
neutral	the labels are a little on the pricey side , and sometimes the label bubbles .
neutral	otherwise , as quoted above , my own_labels gives a real professional look to my wine_bottles .
neutral	in fact , i enjoy the fact that some of my wine sits on display in a local restaurant even_though it '_s not for sale .
neutral	a small percent ( 00_%) of calls do not complete ( doesn_'_t ring or gets connected with anomalies ).
neutral	the digit collection while dialing does not match a normal telephone :
neutral	- the redial button on our phones doesn_'_t work because the iad cannot collect digits fast enough
neutral	- if one pauses while dialing , the call gets placed with an incomplete number
neutral	- conversely , there is a lag after dialing 00 digits
neutral	a small percentage of calls have malfunctioned during the call .
neutral	there is no way of determining what the failure was due to ( our voip device ; the gateway ; other ?)
neutral	too_long to get here without shipping / delivery info .
neutral	i '_ve got lifelock and a good credit_card company that has stopped fraud for me and my wife before .
neutral	lots of reviews saying that there was suspicious_activity on their card after ordering from here .
neutral	granted these were many_years_ago , so we will just have to wait and see .
positive	i am very satisfied with the purchase and i would recommend selectspecs to anyone looking for a great brand at a fraction of the price from my local_dealers !
positive	summed it up up there ^^
positive	excellent service
positive	rollupbanner responded very quickly when another supplier had let_me down .
positive	the work was high_quality , delivered bang on time , and they went the extra_mile on graphics at very reasonable rates evening offering a free small banner which graces the desk of any exhibitor .
positive	i found these style - looking shoes to look really great and much_cheaper compared to u . s versions , also it '_s a new style to me !
positive	really easy to buy from and great prices .
positive	can '_t be beat !
positive	i would definitely order something else .
positive	very easy process and shipped quickly .
positive	thanks !
positive	the total package deal was about 00_% less , compared when we would have rented directly via the car - rental supplier .
positive	and all the services were the same quality .
positive	it was easy to book via internet and the added value of economycarrentals pays of in hard money !
positive	!
positive	great job ... tnx !
positive	!
positive	that sums it up
positive	everything_went very well .
positive	the navigation device was absolutely critical .
positive	we would have been totally lost without it .
positive	the shirt is perfect i really like it !
positive	excellent customer service , especially the customer care team .
positive	products are of good quality , and would not_hesitate to recommend .
positive	i ordered an unbound version of my physical education theory book and it came to my door in a nice package and the loose leaf papers were kept together with rubber bands .
positive	it did not bend the papers and i was pleased to have received my book in good condition .
positive	i '_m glad i found this site because the opposing sites had very expensive rates .
positive	thank_you .
positive	really helpful customer service who responded swiftly to my email query and lived_up to their price match promise when i found it cheaper_elsewhere !
positive	the product itself seems the usual top mares quality and hopefully will help fight off the chill of wreysbury !
positive	i ordered a pair of ray - ban prescription_glasses and had them in hand in less_than a week .
positive	quick and painless with a good price .
positive	i believe smartbuyglasses is a uk company and the lenses were made and fitted in china if you care about that .
positive	as i ordered these glasses on the internet for the sake of value - shopping , i don_'_t suppose i have any ground to criticize their full emersion in the global economy .
positive	also , their policy of donating a pair of glasses for every pair ordered is a nice_touch .
positive	i ' d return for another order .
positive	fast , accurate and great products .
positive	super easy too .
positive	this is not the first cd_key i purchased from this site and i am proud to say that i am very amazed at the quick delivery they have been supporting me with .
positive	the cd_keys i have been receiving over the years are not fake & work perfectly .
positive	the only cautious behavior one needs to take when purchasing products from here is to make_sure the keys are not region locked and that they work at where you live .
positive	i rate their service an a ++++ 00 / 00 .
positive	checked 0 local_dealers for " taste of the wild " brand dog_food . chewy was less money , free shipping and shipped by fed_x
positive	it arrived in 0 days .
positive	my first_impression is great company to deal with
positive	the service was fantastic , always a quick reply and very easy to work with .
positive	the product was delivered ahead of schedule and exactly_what i was looking for .
positive	so_far i have found the usb keys to be a quality build and have had a lot of positive_feedback from our club members about them
positive	i will_definitely be remembering this company for future endeavors and highly_recommend it to anyone looking for a good advertising product .
positive	very cheap very fast
positive	cost was very competitive .
positive	ordered online at 0pm .
positive	was collected from my uk address at 0pm by dhl , and was delivered in california , usa within 00_hours .
positive	no customs issues or problems .
positive	impressive to say the least .
positive	most definitely will be avoiding royal_mail in the future when possible , who wanted to charge double the amount for a much slower service .
positive	highly_recommened .
positive	my first time shopping at this site .
positive	was easy to find what i wanted .
positive	had lots of choices and good prices .
positive	will definitly shop_here again .
positive	“ strong supporter of the gul brand , and if you have any teeshirts for sale let_me know pls .
positive	quick to order and products in a few_days .
positive	all good .”
positive	i use heinnie_haynes regularly they have never let_me down .
positive	from the hundreds of products i have purchased i have returned probably two items that had either not been suitable or had a minor qa issue from oem ( original_equipment manufacturer )
positive	exchanged replaced or refunded instantly no_hesitation .
positive	lightning_fast delivery items well_packaged
positive	very friendly and helpful staff who not only care but they listen to their customers needs and will happily go the extra hundred_miles to find the kit you need
positive	i cannot_praise hh highly_enough .
positive	ordered one day - delivered the next what more can you ask for .

positive	i was in dire need of a rim for my bmw 0 series , i went to the dealership expensive , i went to ebay expensive ; i found this website and was amazed at the prices .
positive	i could not believe rims can be this cheap , so i placed an order and within four days my rim arrived !

positive	i sent in an_email_requesting a quote on some custom_flash_drives .
positive	filled_out the form on 0 different websites , dave with flashbay was the only one who responded and he responded quickly .

positive	im was very happy when i found that ink from inkfarm worked in my epson 000 printer !
positive	ink i bought from a local outfit did not work .
positive	quick , easy and hassle_free .
positive	brilliant service couldn_'_t ask for more
positive	the hard work starts in the mind , once you have conquered that mountain maximuscle advice and reange can help you achieve the true goals you have set out .
positive	the website and advice available is the one of the best if not best supplement company around
positive	i feel in confidence !
positive	not only because they have everything i need in a clear and easy to decipher website , but because they are a shining_example of a company that exercises their american right of freedom of religion .
positive	whenever one of their holy days comes up they shamelessly take that time off and as a person of faith , i respect them more for keeping the 0th day sabbath .
positive	i came on here for crysis warhead to get a quote and it was ridiculously_cheap ( as was every other game i was seeing ) customer for life here .

positive	i rang to get a 0st guitar for my 0 yr_old & they gave straight advice .
positive	the goods were ordered at 0000 on a thursday & arrived at 0000 on the friday .
positive	my daughter & her school music dept were all chuffed with the guitar & accessories so thanks very much .
positive	good value & fast , polite , knowledgeable_staff .
positive	delivered fast without_fuss & did exactly_what it said on the tin .
positive	i will use them again & recommend them to friends & colleagues .
positive	shopped the internet and the partsgeek had the best price going and with shipping a few dollars cheaper_than local .

positive	there are few that can match up
positive	i was pleasantly_surprised - got $_000 for a phone i had thrown in the drawer .
positive	really quick turn_around .
positive	i '_ve made two orders from partsgeek without incidence .
positive	routine , just the way you want it !!
positive	if anything , their delivery was faster_than promised .
positive	tft in seekonk , ma did their best to work with my finances while providing a tire that was comparable to what i was originally looking for .
positive	they were courteous and completed the work within the time frame they quoted me .
positive	i would definitely recommend them !
positive	they have a good range of products and lots of information about sizing .
positive	very good with delivery .
positive	this is only second time of using boiler_juice , however , they have given me a great price .
positive	they did not contact me , before delivery , i just had a card through my front_door saying they had been ?
positive	however , this was a lot sooner_than they had first estimated .
positive	also , i am now waiting for the service engineer , they advertise on their web_site to visit .
positive	i sent an_email , and got a phone_call the very next_day .
positive	prices quoted are far lower_than anyone in the area .
positive	its worth_checking out for boiler services and faults .
positive	we have now used the service engineer .
positive	we was quoted £_000 . 00 inc_vat but plus parts elsewhere , these_people charged , just under_£_000 . 00 inc_vat , labour , nozel , service and pump !!!!
positive	very quick and clean .
positive	excellant value .
positive	i found a site that i ordered cabin_air_filter for a 0000_ford taurus and was with partsgeek i ordered and received without_any_issues .
positive	the parts came in a timely_manner and pleased i was able to purchase the part at partsgeek .
positive	my 0 year_old pc packed in .... i was gutted !
positive	after briefly considering repairs / upgrades , it was obvious that a new pc was needed .
positive	i '_ve had my dino_pc for a few_months now , so have had enough time to give it a good run in and offer a fair review ..
positive	not one to buy on impulse , i always do weeks of research before making a big purchase .
positive	i actually stumbled_upon dino_pc quite late in the decision_making process .
positive	i ' d never_heard of them before , which would normally give me some reservations , but the reviews on here convinced me to go for it .
positive	the website is brilliant ; very informative and easy to use .
positive	the communication from dino and their courier was first_class and accurate .
positive	my pc was delivered within the estimated time frame .
positive	value for money is excellent .
positive	i spent slightly under_£_000 for a ' lower mid_range ' gaming unit .
positive	and it '_s been great for my gaming_needs .
positive	a bit sluggish on ultra settings , but great on high settings .
positive	that '_s fine for me !
positive	from any other supplier , i was looking at an extra £_000 -£_000 for a similar spec .
positive	compared to previous pc purchases , i didn_'_t get much ' free ' software included as standard .
positive	maybe that '_s how they keep the cost down ?
positive	not a problem , as you normally get given what you don_'_t really want or need .
positive	i configured my own spec and got exactly_what i wanted .
positive	in summary , excellent website , great price and delivery service ...... and of course a very decent product .
positive	i doubt value for money can be_beaten .
positive	so_far so good , and i can '_t think of a reason_why dino deserve less_than a 0_star_rating .
positive	the best place to shop , a neighborhood store , disguised as a superstore .
positive	always friendly , always helpful and great prices .
positive	excellent web_site , and excellent in - store service .
positive	fast delivery , parts in great condition , good service .
positive	lots of option with speedy dispatch what more can you ask for ?

positive	communication was brilliant .
positive	the ability to change the date for delivery was fantastic .
positive	and the one hour delivery slot made my life easy !
positive	oh and i forgot to say the product matches the service !
positive	the website is well_laid_out and the prices are good .
positive	i will shop_here again .
positive	i was very impressed with how well my ordered was packaged by prime_pet_supply .
positive	this has not been the case with petflow or chewy .

positive	i '_ve used them a few_times and never had a problem .

positive	i don_'_t believe the 0 struts i purchase from you came with a warranty ?
positive	is there a warranty ?
positive	your free shippment incentive and prompt deliveries are appreciated and have earned my future parts purchases .

positive	i placed my first order with selectspecs . com on the 00nd of december_0000 for some rimless gent '_s glasses , i wasn_'_t expecting delivery until at_least mid january_0000 , but to my great surprise my order was delivered within 0 working days , excluding the christmas_holidays .
positive	running my own business makes me acutely aware of how important customer service is , so what a pleasure it was to witness the speed and efficiency with which my order was dispatched , especially over the christmas_period when i fully expected a delay .
positive	the product was superb , and when compared to a well_known high_street franchise who sells rimless_glasses at £_000 , i definitely received a bargain , having only paid £_00 to selectspecs . com which included delivery plus one additional accoutrement .
positive	i wasn_'_t looking for the cheapest price when buying glasses , but i also didn_'_t want to feel that i was paying for the overheads ( and in some_cases franchise costs ) within the purchase price of the product .
positive	selectspecs . com gave_me a reasonable price , a superb service and an excellent product - what more could i ask for ?
positive	if everyone operated as efficiently as they do there ' d be a massive increase in highly satisfied customers .
positive	people are usually quicker to criticise than praise , however i adhere to the principle of ' praise where praise is due ' - and in this case it '_s richly deserved .
positive	every order up to this point has_been precise , and very timely .
positive	could not ask for better service .
positive	i always buy from b and h . their products are fairly_priced , their shipping is fast and they can be relied on from start to finish .

positive	! thanx
positive	this was my first order of contact_lenses online and i '_ll continue to order from lenstore as i '_m happy with the range of products and their overall service .
positive	i '_ve purchased warranties throughout my life , an odd thing i tell you since i really treat_myself in a devil may care way , i run marathons , i hike mountains , i eat whole cheese cakes and i train martial_arts and get my body and feathers ruffled on a day to day occurrence .
positive	so , when i bought a canon g00 years_ago , and used it on a trip , i also purchased a squaretrade_warranty along with it .
positive	the warranty sat , unused for years .
positive	two and a half to be exact , so i got that familiar feeling anyone gets when they get the clear coat put on their car , or the cabbage they bought that spoiled , that feeling of , unused service .
positive	which was fine , i went on thinking ignorance was bliss and never sure if i would ever need squaretrade for future_purchases , as i seemed to take_care of my things .
positive	and then , while hiking around arizona on a cross_country drive , the wind decided to be my nemesis and knock my tripod mounted camera forwards and into a rock filled path of discomfort .
positive	the camera build like the 0 bit nintendo survived the scuffle with gravity but not completely unphased , a slight scratch had found it '_s way onto my lens , visible in photo '_s .
positive	i finished my cross_country trek , contacted_squaretrade through a few_clicks and presto , box in the mail and a few_days_later my camera were being repaired .
positive	i know such , as i got emails_updating me on it '_s status .
positive	then it arrived back , and my lens was fixed and my life were better and i have bought a warranty through squaretrade on everything i buy .
positive	everything , camera lens and such from ebay , keyboards from amazon .
positive	i hardly ever use the warranties , currently i have 0 and have only required their service 0 times .
positive	another fight with gravity and my phone , and my kindle deciding it didn_'_t want to be a e_- reader and instead opted for paper weight .
positive	i have recommended them to friends and chuckled when they said , " no need ."
positive	and then six_months later when the moon was full and the temperature was right , and they dropped their phone '_s down and escalator at the mall whilst eating kettle cooked corn .
positive	i am not an insured person '_s , i feel no need as i am still young enough to feel invincible and just old enough to know which things to avoid in mass quantities at buffet lines , but if square_trade ever offers health_insurance , i would be first in line .
positive	until then , ever gadget i own is in their hands .
positive	truly , all of them .
positive	good quality goods at the right price +
positive	prompt service
positive	have used this site on previous_occasions .
positive	definitely love the price match option .
positive	prices are among , if not the lowest , on the internet .
positive	for an athlete , supplementwarehouse . com is a big advantage for purchasing in bulk .
positive	they ship very quick and i love the amount of free merchandise available .
positive	i do not find the high shipping prices to be a disadvantage ; when ordering a lot , high shipping should be expected .
positive	will_definitely be using this site more often to fit my needs .
positive	paul and everyone_else at town_fair tires are great !
positive	got a good deal for my rims and tires .

positive	my first time with bookatrack having been recommended to me as a good trackday operator .
positive	as a novice , first time at this track and therefore slower_than other cars , i was happy that the organisers gave a good driver briefing and that they were in control on the day .
positive	the trackday was full but this did not show itself on track with plenty of space for everyone and i did not see any_issues on the day .
positive	i believe the trackdays are run by the owners of the company and this shows .
positive	i have been on a couple of other operators trackdays but these seem to be run by employees who i felt indulged race teams rather_than embrace all track day users who have paid the same to use the track .
positive	i now use cult_pens for all my art pen needs as not only do they have everything i need , but they ship my order off straight_away so i can often receive my pens the next_day ( or two_days if i ordered in the afternoon ).
positive	brilliant .
positive	i used these_guys to purchase some bose quietcomfort 00 .
positive	they were cheaper_than any other_sites out there .
positive	although they were initially out of stock i had a phonecall and email from hispek within an_hour of ordering letting_me know that there would be a 0 week wait , they were very polite and helpful and gave_me the option to get a refund or wait .
positive	i waited since i would rather save a few_quid and it wasn_'_t urgent .
positive	they arrived by courier after 0_weeks , well_packed etc .
positive	very happy .
positive	all good maybe send it with an post and cut down on postage a bit

positive	the actual buildings can be run down looking , but aldi has got it where it counts .

positive	hopefully someone will challenge them soon .

positive	i came_across a bargain treadmill when searching the www after christmas .
positive	i ' d seen some of the reviews over christmas with regards to rather poor delivery , but i thought i would give sports and leisure_uk the benefit of the doubt as people are always more inclined to grumble than praise ... and i wasn_'_t in a hurry .
positive	the driver_phoned sunday_night to confirm delivery for the following_morning and arrived within 0 minutes of the arranged time .
positive	unfortunately when unpacking the treadmill i noticed the console was damaged .
positive	i contacted sports and leisure_uk straight_away and they didn_'_t quibble about sending out another one at all ( and i get to keep the old one for spares ).
positive	ok so i had to wait a week for delivery ... but the treadmill is great .
positive	sports and leisure_uk we also were very helpful when i phoned again to ask for more details on maintenance .
positive	one happy_bunny

positive	this potentially embarrassing mistake on my part was dealt_with efficiently and with no_fuss by this company '_s phone operative .
positive	much_appreciated !
positive	it '_s quite remarkable really , but the item was ordered at a weekend and delivered on a tuesday .
positive	i was kept_informed by email at every_stage and on the tuesday_morning was informed as to the hour it was being delivered .
positive	it came within the first minute of the alloted hour !
positive	how efficient is that ?
positive	the price was unbeatable as well , so keep_up the good work .
positive	this is one of the most efficient , accurate and friendly companies that i have had dealings with - thoroughly_recommended .
positive	san_francisco herb company has always sent me quality products in a very timely_manner .
positive	i would recommend this company to anyone_wanting herbs , spices , teas or any other of the product that they supply .
positive	i never respond to these requests for feedback but want to in this case .
positive	i could not have been more pleased .
positive	my clubs were picked_up as scheduled , and delivered as scheduled in perfect_condition .
positive	thank_you mr . shipsticks !
positive	i am sure i will use them again as the need_arises .
positive	after adding the initial item to my cart that i was going to purchase , they presented such a huge list of free_samples and discounted items on the cart page that i perused it for about a half - hour .
positive	wow , i got so much free stuff : protein_powders and bars , energy drinks , etc .
positive	the shipping was a little high , but that '_s pretty normal considering the weight of the package due to all the free items i got .
positive	great place !
positive	i had all 0 tires replaced including mounted , balanced and front_end alignment .

positive	when i am considering_purchasing outdoor_equipment i always refer to the outdoor_shop .
positive	their professionalism towards customers and their range of products is often second to none .
positive	also , the price is extremely competitive indeed .
positive	further to this , it is rare to find a retail shop that provides an exceptionally effective and efficient delivery system which is again well priced and particularly important considering i live in scotland .
positive	enough said ...?
positive	my order was shipped right_away , took less_than a week and i was playing with my " toy ".
positive	i do wish i had been able to get the color i wanted but i was well aware it may not be so can '_t complain .

positive	no kidding .
positive	i shop b_&_h for my videography and photography and lighting equipment .
positive	they carry all the best brands .
positive	if they don_'_t have it , it '_s going to be hard to find .
positive	price ?
positive	these_guys are going to have , if not the best price , which they do 00 . 000_% of the time , they will have the next best price .
positive	but you will not find better shipment options , communications about the order and order fulfillment .
positive	at_least , that '_s been my experience .
positive	if that '_s not enough , i recently bought a fuji x00 just for snaps thru b_&_h , don_'_t always need the 0d .
positive	a week_later i found a better price with a competitor .
positive	the box is opened , i '_ve used the camera .
positive	notified b_&_h , a couple of emails later , here '_s the difference .
positive	no_fuss .

positive	as far as any improvements go , the website could stand to be upgraded .
positive	clicking on a transistor will likely take you to a fuzzy black and white graphic of an i . c .
positive	everything is an i . c .
positive	:) the belts should be organized better , too .
positive	maybe classify them all into easy - to - understand sbo , sbm , fbl , fbm designations .

positive	very nice kilt .
positive	it '_s my third from buy a kilt and i '_m not disappointed .
positive	why three ?
positive	sizing .
positive	the first was too big , it was a 00 " waist , just a little too much , and the colors weren_'_t exactly_what i was expecting - but it was still a great kilt for the price .
positive	i purchased a second 00 " that was perfect when i got it .
positive	i used it all last_year but i do a lot of swimming through the summer and my waist shrinks .
positive	so i bought number 0 .
positive	it '_s a 00 " and a little too small today , but i '_m expecting it to be ideal once i get into summer shape .
positive	the kilt tartans i bought were freedom ( was expecting blue rather_than purple , but a closer look at the photo on the sight shows it '_s purple ), douglas modern , and now gunn modern .
positive	each are very nice and a great value , it probably_won_'_t be long before i purchase number 0 - but i '_ll have to think up another excuse to tell my wife .
positive	did i mention how quickly it arrived ?
positive	i '_m overjoyed that i can order on a monday and have the kilt delivered in the u . s . on thursday - wow .
positive	i am rebuilding a model t , which requires all_kinds of old hardware .
positive	the have met all my needs and their prices are not out of line !

positive	i have dealt_with many online pool_supply companies over the years - some have very good service with reasonable prices - depending_on the specific item .
positive	other_companies have cheap prices on everything , but lack quality in the products and have poor customer service .
positive	one experience with those companies is more than enough .
positive	i '_m sure anyone reading this review who has ever bought anything online have had the same experiences .
positive	it '_s often hit and miss .
positive	after finding infloorpoolparts / com i have found their prices to be very competitive , their shippping is fast and their communication and service have been excellent .
positive	and they are very experienced and know their stuff .
positive	i '_ve asked some questions about very specific parts and received honest and straight - forward answers - no double - talk .
positive	and you won_'_t be sold a generic part , and told - " here , this should fit ".
positive	i needed some replacement parts which a couple of big name retail pool stores told me the part was so old that no one makes it any more .
positive	and that ( their store ) couldn_'_t even special order it - i should be lucky to find an after - market replacement part .
positive	well , after finding " infloor " they not only had the right part , it was a new oem in the original manufacture '_s packaging .
positive	so it isn_'_t made any more ?
positive	oh , really ?
positive	!
positive	infloorpoolparts / com are now my # 0 source i go to first .
positive	they made the whole_experience with our tax settlement non stressful with continuous communication and working with us to get the best offer possible .
positive	i would refer them to family and friends .

positive	i recomende this company to friends and family and others .

positive	from the moment we placed the order we had online tracking .

positive	yesterday was my first order on onlinekeystore and it was great .
positive	i got a call of duty black_ops steam_key for cheap and it had fast delivery .
positive	i contacted support just to make_sure everything was going through and they responded very promptly .
positive	i highly_recommend this company to anyone searching for games .
positive	i find it a great site to buy or rent textbooks for any class , with great quality at a very low_cost .
positive	i use this one to translate and learn new words in other languages and in english too , it is quite informative and easy to use , i love it :)
positive	it has everything , and it is unlimited about what you can do as a manager of your own team , the only_thing i would love to see is a little change , in which the hattrick live matches instead of reading what happened in the match watching a mini java , shockwave , ms silverlight , or any video platform of what happened in the match , and also a feature of changing that background color of the website , not just green , but purple , black , blue , red , yellow , etc .
positive	other than that the game is great .
positive	my experience with you it '_s always great , i find everything i need , and cheaper_than anywhere_else you ' re still to my opinion on top of the game , so keep it up .
positive	whoever doesn_'_t know amazon they don_'_t know how to shop wisely over the internet .
positive	with amazon , 00 . 0 % of the things you want to buy you will find it there and many of them cheaper_than any other store .
positive	i recommend it very much to anybody .
positive	keep it up .
positive	i conceive paypal very much , hopefully it never gets hacked or take_advantage of its customers .
positive	it is used for many millions of people and trusted almost everywhere for any monetary transaction , and so_far for me it hasn_'_t let_me down yet , when i purchase something using it or when transferring_money from one place to another , it is just great !
positive	i just simply love it , it is the best video site out there and the most complete collection of videos , where you can find anything you would want to watch and from many languages .
positive	one feature that some other video website have that i ' d love youtube could add is the ability to change the aspect ration of the videos played like 00 : 0 , 0 : 0 , etc , and an ability to " switch on and off the lights " of the website , while watching a video so it looks darker if you don_'_t like putting the vids on full - screen ..
positive	you can find many things at cheaper costs compared to other retail_stores .
positive	it '_s very easy to more around the site and find what you need .
positive	google is the best search_engine out there , gives you more specific answers to your inquiries , whatever you type , bam is there .
positive	the only_thing that i '_m missing from it , is the cache or " highlighted " feature that it had when you wanted to find where something was written in a website .
positive	in my opinion you don_'_t need to shop anywhere_else .
positive	they have everything you need !
positive	the customer service should set the standard for other businesses .
positive	the salespeople are very knowledgeable about there products and they are willing to help you if you have any questoions .
positive	would highly_recommend gear0music . com
positive	usual excellent service from the guys at 0000rpm
positive	usual excellent service , would highly_recommend

positive	the folks at town_fair were professional , efficient and helpful .
positive	they tried to help me find the least_expensive solution to my problem first .
positive	then they tried to help me ascertain if my problem was covered under_warranty .

positive	my item was fully_trackable with the option to change the delivery date which i actually had to use as i wasn_'_t going to be home on the planned delivery date and it worked_perfectly ( along with confirmation_emails of the date change plus an_email on the day with a one hour delivery slot ).

positive	i am a contractor and home rehab - er .
positive	i only purchase my cabinets from cabinet_giant , they have the best prices on great quality cabinets , i would rather choose their cabinets than my own suppliers .
positive	their standard quality cabinets look great , and when you install a granite counter top on them , you cant tell if they are $ 0 , 000 cabinets or $_00 , 000 cabinets .
positive	i always add some blu_- motion soft closer '_s and everyone_loves their kitchens .
positive	assembly is straight_forward but does take some time , honestly , the convenience of not transporting fully assembled cabinets makes the assembly worth it .

positive	they are stiff and comfortable when using my spd pedals on my trek soho commuter bike .

positive	saab parts are not easy to find let_alone in idaho .
positive	ordered the parts i needed from europarts and they charge a fair price and i had the parts in 0 days .
positive	i fixed my car for $_00 instead of paying the $_000 estimate from the only car garage in town that works on saabs .
positive	one thing though .... when you get a bad review stop with the " it '_s not our fault " response .
positive	everybody messes up from time to time so take your medicine when you do and stop with the excuses .
positive	it '_s very bush league .
positive	i '_ve had several dealings with b_&_h and they '_ve never let_me down .
positive	all items are delivered on time in excellent condition .
positive	possibly the best service on the internet .

positive	bestilte nye snørebånd fredag , og de blev_sendt samme_dag , så_jeg_fik dem med_posten mandag .
positive	det ser umiddelbart ud som_om_de_har forbedret deres leveringstider .
positive	helt_igennem god_oplevelse .
positive	den_eneste lille udfordring jeg_havde var at jeg_skulle bruge fakturaen , og_der gik mere_end en_uge inden de trak pengene og fakturaen havnede i min mailbox .
positive	men ellers ganske anbefalelsesværdigt
positive	super_oplevelse .
positive	varerne stod foran min hoveddør dagen_efter_bestilling , jeg_fik byttet et fejlkøb uden_problemer , og sparede en mindre formue da god maling jo normalt er p .... dyrt .

positive	sejt :)
positive	lynhurtig levering det spil jeg_havde_bestilt .

positive	i was in the market for an iwc and i had gone to an iwc shop .
positive	after , trying on the watch and picking out the one i wanted i began researching the best prices .
positive	after a week or so of in person and online price and reputation of dealer research , i landed on luxuryofwatches . com .
positive	not only was their price the lowest i found , which was $ 0 , 000 cheaper_than the retail price tag , but they also had good ratings and feed_back .
positive	i felt_confident after_reading the good and bad feed_back ( very few ) that i would purchase my watch from them .
positive	after i did so , the watch shipped to me sooner_than even expected and i couldn_'_t be_happier with my watch and the whole_experience !
positive	i would definitely consider buying my next watch from them .
positive	and at the moment i can '_t think of a reason not to .
positive	other than some brief confusion finding the lot at the end of winding narrow road in an ugly industrial section , we had a great experience .
positive	friendly and fast , both at the service booth and in shuttle_buses .
positive	this will be my first choice next time i fly from newark .
positive	price is low for the region , but not the absolute cheapest .
positive	still , the service is worth the extra buck a day .
positive	when i need a fastener , this is the place i go .
positive	quick response , great products .
positive	highly_recommended .
positive	we looked at several websites to find new filters .
positive	we have a camper and had problems finding locally the right size filter for the a /_c .
positive	dryers price and availability was awesome .
positive	will be ordering more filters as we need them ...
positive	i would go to laptopscreen . com for all my screen replacements .
positive	they give a fair price on the item and give great shipping rates especially for overnight shipping .
positive	pcgamesuppy . com is great !
positive	i use it to buy online playstation networks cards .
positive	its great because you receive the redeem_code within 00_minutes and its very useful to me because the nearest store to buy the psn_cards is 0 hour away from my house , so pcgamesupply is much faster and i can pay with paypal .
positive	it '_s was easy to use and the cheapest airport_parking i can find this time ( purple_parking ).
positive	ordered part on wednesday had it friday
positive	i have used arguscarhire twice recently for car_rentals in italy .
positive	both_times they have offered the best price , better even than my usual corporate rate .
positive	the avis staff in bergamo were friendly , helpful and a pleasure to deal with .
positive	in these times of being blatantly ripped_off , it is great to find argus offering a good prices and good service .
positive	e '_ve just done a round - the - world trip and i knew if i kept the photos on the computer they would get lost with the millions of others .
positive	it was a good discipline to reduce the number of photos into a photobook , choosing only the best .
positive	the format was simple , although it is easier if you also open up a folder of the photos on your computer so you can select them from a bigger preview than the software offers .
positive	it is easy to change the photo size , shape and to add text wherever you want it .
positive	the quality of the paper is fine and the photos look good .
positive	no_problems with the printing and as long as your photo is good , they reproduce well in the book .
positive	trouble_free delivery and better price than direct from the company .
positive	thanks
positive	tutto_bene , consigliato
positive	excellent service
positive	i had some problems with them but i figured they had nothing to do and i was angry . now i realize that it is a trustworthy and competent website and i would recommend this to anyone_who_wants gift_cards !
positive	!
positive	the deal is almost_instant and it '_s safe and sound
positive	ginger0 supply quality reliable products whilst giving you a huge choice of configurations at low_prices with super_fast lead times but above all it is their consistently good customer service that puts them head and shoulders_above the rest .
positive	fantastic service , great product and price .
positive	really can '_t fault this product or the company that supplied it !
positive	good products , cheap , fast and efficient – what more can i say , except that as a returning fisherman after 00 years absence , my knowledge was more than a little rusty ...
positive	so the friendly detailed helpful descriptions of all the products , what they were for and how to use them was invaluable in helping_me make rational choices .
positive	thank_you .
positive	top_marks for delivery .
positive	it arrives next working day and they even photograph your parcel with your name and address on ( not really sure why but it '_s a nice_touch ).
positive	the rewards_program is good idea and appears to be better value than most other_places .
positive	again a nice extra .
positive	the website could do with a bit of improvement .
positive	it '_s not bad by any means but is little_bit behind the times .
positive	the login and account management in particular could use some work on a u . i .
positive	level but all the functional requirements are there .
positive	finally they are great for prices .
positive	particulary games that have been out for a while .
positive	they will usually be selling it cheaper_than anywhere_else if it '_s been out for a while .
positive	that '_s got to be the main_reason i shop there , i check the prices everywhere and buy from whoever is cheapest .
positive	a lot of the time it '_s shopto and when it is i '_m always chuffed because i know it will arrive the next working day and i '_ll get some reward_points :)
positive	worked without a hitch .
positive	great service .
positive	very polite staff at the parking area .

positive	the restaurant staff , especially peter , was phenominal .
positive	i would recommend your facility to everyone .
positive	nice part , fit_perfectly , and well_packaged for shipping .
positive	door to door service with a 00 day turn - around for a price that was less_than half of what i was quoted from the two big highstreet retailers .
positive	had no_issues at all in using the design your won feature , delivery was well within what was said , and will be ordering more for friends .
positive	been shopping with shopto for a while now and all i can say is wow , they seriously are the best video game supplier out there .
positive	pre orders are delivered before_release sometimes the day before maybe two_days i pre orderd hitman absolution and it came saturday when its not released untill the following_tuesday , ordered a ps_vita wifi bundle and they sent me the 0g / wifi bundle at no extra_cost , customer service is top_class very helpful , seriously can '_t believe iv only just started shopping with them this year as i won_'_t be shopping anywhere_else .
positive	good value for money , extensive catalogue of products ( some increasingly hard to find on the high_street ) and a well - laid_out website made ordering easy and straight - forward .
positive	delivery was quick , packaging solid but not excessive - it even came with a free pen : what more needs to be said ?
positive	i '_ll be using them again and recommending them , too .
positive	ordered a blower_fan resistor for my ' 00 tacoma on jan_00th and received on the 00th .

positive	the pick_up in civitavecchia was an easy walk from the cruise port .
positive	the lady working the counter was nice .
positive	we arrived early and needed to wait 0 . 0 hrs due to the definitive drop_off time needed .
positive	it would have been nice to have a map of the pick_up city and drop_off point as we had a lot of difficulty locating the drop_off in rome .
positive	there is no name on the outside of the building and it is actually inside the train_station .
positive	this should be noted on the rental contract as we drove around the termini train_station for over an_hour trying to find the drop_off .
positive	if we had not been a pair ( one to stay with the car and one to go in checking for the location ) it would have been difficult with police telling us we could not park at the curb .

positive	you have a humungus collection of knives and other gear on your website which is great .
positive	there are only really 0 things i dont like about your website ,
positive	firstly i dont understand_why some of the products are so expensive like 000_quid for a normal looking folding_knife or 00 quid for a flint striker or a pen ?
positive	the product descriptions are pretty short and in my opinion there is not enough information to justify paying for that because it doesnt tell me why it is so much .
positive	i would like more detailed info / specs when i was going more_expensive products .
positive	secondly when looking at products by a specific manufacturer / brand e . g knives -.> tops ( which is half way down the page and i have to scroll back down to find it ) when i want to go back to the main knife page it takes me straight back to the top so ive got to scroll back down to where i was .
positive	that just makes it a little annoying to browse on the website sometimes .
positive	other that that i think you see loads of great stuff and have great service !
positive	great magnets and very prompt delivery .
positive	i ordered after lunch and received them first post next_day .
positive	very pleased .

positive	i have been buying since long time and they offer good prices , quality and all i need for tv production
positive	actual booking part no problem what so ever , quick and easy .
positive	only_thing i found but it might be the same at other rental_companies , is the time they take to process you to get your car , uk takes 00_mins max , in don muang at budget it was more like 00 .
positive	i had never used barrington_sports before and was aprehensive , but the products are great and where dispatched very swiftly .

positive	they are top_notch and effidient .
positive	i first found out about this product from a online review site which compared them to the other options in the space called consumers_advocate .

positive	ultimately this service is well_worth it for my grandmother who_lives alone and has already had a fall .
positive	i appreciate that she now has their monitoring service to stay safer .
positive	there are very few sources of information online for medical alerts .
positive	when my grandmother had her fall , she cut her leg extremely deeply and nobody knew about it for several hours before my aunt happened to stop by .
positive	for seniors who live alone getting a service like the medical alert from medical guardian can be the difference in how long they get much needed care .
positive	consumers advocates helped_me to find the aarp recommended medical alert which is also less_expensive with better hardware as compared with the other options out there .
positive	i feel better knowing that if my grandma has another fall that she can quickly and easily get help from someone_who can respond quickly .
positive	i needed to find a plumber when my house had the sewer line collapse creating an_emergency situation .

positive	i '_ve used bee packaging several_times over the years for my shipping needs and i have not once been_disappointed .
positive	usually i know what type of packaging i need and they have it available with no_problems but one time i knew kind of what i wanted but not exactly ... and the salesperson walked me through all their products until we finally found exactly_what i needed .
positive	i have never experienced dedication to helping a customer like that before .
positive	not from any other company i have dealt_with in the past .
positive	because of that , i use bee packaging as often as possible for all my packaging needs .

positive	purchased a shower from buyaparcel .
positive	it was the best price by some distance and the fact they use dpd delivery meant that the delivery cost to n . ireland was the same as the rest of the uk - other_companies were looking £_00 to deliver to n . ireland .

positive	i like being_able to pay for anything with it like i would my bank card .
positive	b_&_h not only has the best customer_support of any photography store i know , but in most_cases it also has the lowest_prices .
positive	i '_ve never had a bad_experience with b_&_h , and i '_ve purchased a lot of expensive gear from them .
positive	plus they often have great deals , but they never stoop to cheesy hard sells or silly , flashy advertising .
positive	there is something dignified in they way they present themselves and their products .

positive	i had been looking for a particular pair of trail running_shoes for my partner for xmas and had resigned_myself to missing them - my usual online port of call for running gear had sold out of her size , but a quick google_search unearthed barrington_sports .

positive	i got an exhaust_manifold .
positive	after getting it and checking with auto_repair_shops on the cost to have it installed , they asked me a question that i was not asked when ordering .
positive	that question was what size motor is in the car .
positive	knowing that i will not have it installed before the 00 days are up i sure hope it is the right one .
positive	we are impressed with education material provided and the concern the correct product is chosen for our particular situation .
positive	marco really listened to our concerns for future events and then provided several companies that provided solutions to choose from .
positive	he made sure we understood each phase and was happy to take time to explain in a manner we could understand .
positive	what an unusual gift .
positive	it '_s just that amazing that you would buy one for yourself .

positive	the ordering_process is simple .
positive	a conformation of your selections is immediate .
positive	orders are immediately packed and to the shipper within hours .
positive	a tracking document is in your email within a very short time .
positive	west_coast shaving sets the industry_standard for service , while others disappoint with slow service , some never acknowledge your order and leave you wondering_if you will ever get the product or when it will be shipped , my orders with west_coast shipping were all delivered within two_days from date or order , and the other company has not yet delivered my order and it has_been over nine_days , will i receive the product today , tomorrow , or next week ?
positive	just order from west_coast shaving and avoid the hassle and uncertainty .
positive	i live in the us and ordered a lavatube from ecigwizard due to the company in my country being sold out .

positive	i ordered it tuesday_night / wednesday_morning at 00 : 00 am , and received it thursday_morning at 00 : 00 .
positive	prior to my purchase , i had conversations with this company via_email to inquire_about the product , and they were very prompt and courteous .
positive	i will_definitely use them again , and recommend anyone looking into electronic_cigarettes in the uk ( or here , for that matter ) to give them a shot .
positive	well_worth it !
positive	it is a great idea .
positive	the idea of throwing away a working phone bugged me .
positive	to know someone is willing to pay for it is great .
positive	well_done

positive	should be o . k .
positive	for a winter daysack , i use snowshoes when needed , and they should fit the tension straps easily .
positive	looking_forward to another proper winter .

positive	i ordered a toner_cartridge at 0 :_00am and it arrived the same day around_0pm !

positive	based on this experience , i '_ve recommended ink_station to the people at my company who purchase stationery supplies .
positive	this was the first time that i had ordered parts from design000 and i have to say that their service from website ordering to delivery is excellent .
positive	good quality parts at a decent price .

positive	my parents are going on a rv trip to florida from north_carolina after christmas , so i thought it would be nice to help them with their fuel costs .
positive	i stopped into my local kmart to purchase several gas cards .
positive	what a colossal waste of time .
positive	seriously one of the worst customer experiences i '_ve ever had .
positive	i spent 00_minutes in that place waiting for them to straighten out issues with activating the cards , and still walked out of there empty - handed .
positive	with great frustration , i left .
positive	after a quick google_search for gift_cards , i landed at giftcards . com .
positive	in less then 0 minutes , not only had i sent them a visa_gift_card , but also had the chance to customize the card by adding a picture of their rv to it .
positive	pretty awesome , and very reasonable extra costs for such customization .
positive	love it .
positive	will be a frequent visitor and user of giftcards . com .
positive	easy to use site , vast product range & very competitive prices .
positive	good choice of delivery slots & very very quick , efficient delivery .

positive	professionalism at its best .

positive	i love goldstar .
positive	seriously .
positive	i find fun things to do , shows to see , and discounted concert_tickets ( my favorite part !)
positive	all the time to keep my from spending yet another night with my pal netflix .
positive	i mean , netflix and i are totally in a serious ltr , don_'_t get me wrong , but i '_m not entirely loyal .
positive	goldstar and i have been messing_around n the side since late 0000 or early 0000 .
positive	goldstar provides a lot that netflix doesn_'_t : fresh_air form getting out of the house , social interaction ( important for finding people to watch netflix with !
positive	), and a reason to stuff ear_plugs in my ears and pretend i am 00 again at a concert ..
positive	i cannot say enough good things about goldstar .
positive	look at my purchase history -- i am a serious long - term customer ( just don_'_t tell netflix , please , i beg you -- it would end badly ), and i value your service a lot .
positive	the only_thing i could wish for would be more comps , and more concerts , especially small venues .
positive	also , it might be worth knowing on your end that the best feature of red_velvet is the easy - cancel feature .
positive	i have used it a number of times , and i thank_you for it .
positive	you should also know that most venues do not have a clue what red_velvet means and treat red_velvet customers the same as they treat other customers .
positive	they typically operate on a first - come , first - served basis , so despite_being at the top of the list and identified as a " red_velvet member ", if i get there with 00 people ahead of me in line , i am still getting the 00th best seats in the house .
positive	in other_words , red_velvet doesn_'_t mean diddly at the box office .
positive	just please keep doing the rest of what you do so well .
positive	oh , and one thing i have wished for for years : please make an android_app !!
positive	nevermind apple ( iphone people get all the love -- pffffftt ), just give us an android_app for searching for tix and for showing the purchase confirmation to the venues instead of printing one .
positive	love , and warm wishes ,

positive	i '_ve been using priceline for years as my go - to place for travel bookings -- both domestic and international .
positive	i love having the ability to bid on everything from flights , to hotels , to rental_cars .
positive	i would always suggest to the user to use priceline to get a deal especially on hotels and rental_cars .
positive	the flights are a little more dicey -- i think that the prices can '_t change very much , and if you want to get somewhere at a certain time , i wouldn_'_t suggest bidding , but just looking at the prices on the site .
positive	my tip for getting the best prices ?
positive	first , check priceline '_s express_deals and traditional prices after also checking kayak and hotwire .
positive	then , go for the bid that '_s a bit below what the listed prices are .
positive	you can usually get an idea of what you may get from doing this .
positive	i '_ve never been let_down by the site , and look_forward to using it more and more and suggesting it to more and more people !
positive	!

positive	i '_m pleased i discovered this company via the internet , who were very helpful in providing the chair i required .
positive	i live in italy and am confined to bed most of the time .

positive	the only_drawback was the time it took to get the parts .

positive	they take the hassle of buying supplements online out of the picture and make the process really enjoyable .
positive	plus the additional discounts i always receive by email , its just the icing_on the cake .
positive	this is the only company that i purchase my supplements from and will_continue to be the only company that i purchase from .
positive	thanks again supplementwarehouse . com for being my own source for sports_nutrition .
positive	i have been very pleased with my transactions with partsgeek .
positive	good prices and timely delivery of the product .
positive	they have things that i could not find through the part stores .
positive	they have my business from now on .
positive	loads of quality products , easliy accessed , quick service .
positive	chose the cheapest package of frame and lenses as on tight_budget , very happy with quality and style for price .
positive	clear vision and frame lightest i '_ve ever had .
positive	for less_than £_00 i '_m very pleased .
positive	might even consider some prescription_sunglasses for the car at the price .
positive	very slick process , good price and local_garage chosen was very good
positive	saved about $_00 between the two parts i ordered and this was my second order ... saved big on first order also .... great site , easy to use ...
positive	very satisfied with prices , quality and delivery time .
positive	after years of using the same supplier , which usually meant three or four phone_calls before a competitive price was quoted every delivery , i now make one call to arrange a delivery at a very competitive price and very quickly .
positive	i needed a low value prescription only medicine and vet -_medic provided a fast and professional service at the best price i could find online .
positive	it was most helpful to be able to scan and attach the prescription rather_than having to post it , too !
positive	when i need other medicines for my elderly dogs , i will_definitely include them in my research when deciding on a supplier .
positive	i ' d never bought from another site before , and was always a little_worried_about being_scammed , but after i made my purchase i was contacted within minutes and given exactly_what was promised .
positive	character is actually leveled and can be seen crafting every so often as well !
positive	great site , 000_% satisfied .
positive	will buy from again .
positive	this is the sixth time i have used autoeurope for my car_rental and i '_m am not what you ' d consider your normal renter .
positive	as an " alfista " i have a love of all things alfa_romeo and it '_s a major part of my trip to italy to drive the latest product .
positive	every trip , autoeurope and their affiliates have gone out of their way to get me the car i wanted ... except for this trip .
positive	not that they didn_'_t try .
positive	it was just my bad timing that eurocar was switching over their alfa fleet , sending every returned car back to the barn for resale and the new batch had not been delivered yet .
positive	their service was top_notch and i appreciated their efforts .
positive	not heard of the company but they were a great price and free delivery , placed the order had a number of emails_confirming the order , despatch etc .
positive	then text_messages confirming delivery .
positive	service as good as amazon and considerably_cheaper .
positive	will use again and recommend to anyone .
positive	not used kwik fits mobile_tyre service before but have already_recommended to friends and family .
positive	i booked at short_notice and the service was fantastic as they first of all sourced my hard to find tyres , then turned_up and quickly and efficiently fitted them .
positive	will_definitely use again next year
positive	i would always shop at parts_geek before any other competitor out there .
positive	they offer many options , secure checkout on orders , refunds but mostly .... u will find what you looking for at a discounted price .
positive	i have purchased 0 pairs of specs from selectspecs . com and the service i received was second to none even_though the spec were cheap it didn_'_t change the service
positive	molto efficente .
positive	took them a calendaristic month to build it , although on the build page it said 0 - 00 days ( working days ).
positive	everything else went_smooth , they even dealt patiently with my anoying phone_calls ; it didnt feel_like they had something else to do and need to hang_up as others make you feel .
positive	p . s .
positive	if you build a fancy pc ( like a did ) dont be cheap ( like i was ) and pay the extra premium for 0 days build .
positive	might feel expensive but you get you custom computer at_least 0_weeks faster .
positive	:)
positive	just got wofenstein in 0 min , aprox £_00 cheaper_than steam .
positive	great car , friendly and quick service .
positive	i have used barrington '_s exclusively for a number of years_now having had poor service and quality issues with other_suppliers of similar services .
positive	barrington '_s have never let_me down , unlike the competition !
positive	supplement_warehouse has_been meeting my sports_nutrition needs for something like going on three years_now .
positive	when i first started_using them they had a lot of energy like a new startup - you could see it with the handful of confetti and random unexpected little gifts they ' d always throw into the box with a large order .
positive	now and then they ' d send you the wrong flavor or something , and usually would make up for it by sending out a replacement and letting you keep the oops order .
positive	nice !
positive	they '_ve become more professional now , no confetti , and you actually select your " gifts " ( samples ) to go with your order which isn_'_t quite as fun .
positive	but they are very dependable , extremely quick with the shipping , and have really great prices - and unlike_other_sites they don_'_t advertise low_prices and then ask you to make up the difference on shipping and handling_charges - instead they charge the straight up actual shipping_costs which are really not much , and it '_s usually really easy to either purchase over the threshold for free shipping or pick_up an item that makes your entire order free shipping .
positive	great merchant !
positive	complete order came in from the various warehouses over a few_days .
positive	all parts were correct , just as ordered , items were packed and packaged well .
positive	no_issues at all .
positive	the product i had chosen from the website , based on technical specifications and photo , it totally_satisfied my needs , as well the services provided .
positive	the product arrived in a fast time , shipping condition was excellent , as well as the delivery .
positive	i reccommend to anyone to buy from oktal , the ' re doing a great business .
positive	thank_you , oktal , for the services provided , and keep_up the good work .
positive	ordered an oil_dipstick force my nissan .
positive	first off found it quickly and wothout having to put in to much info .

positive	thanks for providing a place that is the easiest online to get what we need when we need .
positive	it actually took_longer to register then it did to receive my cd - key .
positive	only_thing i reacted to was when i was checking out my order , it used words like " billig address " and such , so i thought for a moment i was going to get it in my mailbox .

positive	bought a british army knife ( stainless_steel ) from heinnie - price : good enough thanks ; reviews pretty_much what i would expect with the outcome approximating " really quite nice , actually " :-)
positive	yes , the blade edge is a little " grainy " but a few_minutes with my favourite whetstone on the blade and some oil on the joints and i was quite happy with the result .
positive	given that this is my daily carry for work as well as leisure , i expect it to get bashed , dropped , stood on and covered in everything from paint to " unidentified organic material " ( potato peelings , beans , chicken curry etc when camping with my two little girls in the garden of a summer afternoon ) so i looked for this knife specifically .
positive	as to one previous reviewer not sure what to do with the spike - ask a yachtsman ( which i '_m not ) or get some paracord and have a bash at lanyards for the knife shackle and a survival bracelet or two .
positive	and a fishing net ( adventurous , funny ).
positive	and a hammock ( really adventurous , hysterical , take your life in your hands when testing ).
positive	all of which are immeasurably easier to achieve with the marlin spike .
positive	it '_s rough and ready , feels solid and like everyone_else said already , i expect years of unstinting service from it - and it '_s british , so well_done chaps , very well pleased .
positive	just had £_00 put into my bank , quidco saved me money on my car insurance , good timing for christmas , thankyou .
positive	i always use pet_supermarket for my filters , the best prices , and a fast delivery .
positive	the service was good , i also phone them about the pump and they were very helpful
positive	i have been very happy with blackcircles , the tyres and the fitting were excellent , thankyou .
positive	easy to book , convienient to birmingham_airport & stress_free
positive	partsgeek helps ease the frustration i have been experiencing with local parts suppliers .
positive	because of the economy , it seems that no one wants to carry inventory anymore .
positive	as long as i '_m waiting around for parts to arrive , why not order them through partsgeek and save some money ?
positive	couldn_'_t fault appliance_online in any shape or form .
positive	from the ease of the ordering_process to the delivery of my washing_machine .
positive	after ordering they gave_me a call to confirm that my order was correct and explained the exact delivery process , them they updated me to what was happening via_email .
positive	got a call from them on the morning of delivery and an call from the delivery driver to tell me the exact time he would deliver .
positive	well impressed with the whole service from start to finish .
positive	they have everything but not open on weekends
positive	the part was an exact_fit , the price was great and the delivery was better_than estimated .
positive	i will use this supplier again when needed .
positive	this company provides low_prices and provide many options to try new products through free_samples .
positive	this i feel allows for someone like me to feel motivated to figure_out what products work best for my health and work outs .
positive	i highly rate supplement_warehouse for their tons of options and fast shipping and processing .
positive	i find it utterly amazing that i can order a bottle of tullibardine 00yr late one night and be sipping it two_days_later half way ' round the world !
positive	this is a good place to look and see just about everything possible .
positive	they rep all the quality seed companies .
positive	the data provided has_been right - on .
positive	i looked on line through several places to buy my contacts .
positive	opticontacts . com was the best price for my contacts .
positive	easy order and quick delivery .

positive	i have ordered stuff from heinnie_haynes for years they are very reliable with fast delivery and excellent communication_regarding orders .
positive	i would not_hesitate to recommend them .
positive	snabb och smidig leverans !
positive	mycket nöjd !
positive	the pricing is 0 - 00_% lower then bodybuilding . com .
positive	they give you many more free_gifts and options for fore " reducing " your shipping by buying items that give you shipping credit .
positive	this is a very good idea in my opinion .
positive	they also sell items at a discount when they are nearing or just past their normal " shelf_life ".
positive	the website however is very difficult to navigate unless you know exactly_what your looking at and looking for .
positive	the item descriptions are incomplete at best .
positive	if you are familiar with supplements and know about what your looking for then it shouldn_'_t be much of an issue .
positive	very pleased with the golf_trolley .
positive	dont_know how they do it at the price . amazing fast delivery .
positive	a very satisfying and trouble_free experience .

positive	despite me having zero experience with producing a banner the website can do this for you .
positive	however i needed something more in - style to what i had done for a poster campaign .
positive	i sent my banner image and was then given advice via_email conversations which helped no end .
positive	their patience with my lack of knowledge was never less_than perfect .

positive	this was a fantastic experience !
positive	the tyres were cheaper_than anywhere i searched , believe me i searched_everywhere .

positive	easy to use .
positive	found good prices .
positive	i needed a replacement mounting_plate for the top box i bought from cmpo some 0 years back .

positive	the new plate arrived the next_day only 00_hours_later - all for only £_00 !
positive	the part was easy to look - up and they had it in stock when no one else did .
positive	i will recommend parts_geek to all my friends .
positive	man , it is nice ordering parts without running all over town .
positive	it '_s nice
positive	knowing i '_m getting the right part without talking to someone that is
positive	just trying to show me how much they know about cars .
positive	i am building my next project right now !
positive	booking was straight_forward and price very reasonable .
positive	i normally use standard airport_parking but decided to use the meet and greet service this time .

positive	the flights were fairly uneventful , except for not being_able to sit together , as we had arranged when we booked the flights , from phoenix to orlando .
positive	good flights , no other problems .
positive	the hotel was adequate , worth more than the $_00 . 00 per_night it cost us by buying a hotel / flight package .

positive	i recently_purchased two loose_diamonds from brilliance to upgrade my wife '_s diamond for her engagement_ring , and then to get a similar diamond to make earrings for her .
positive	i purchased a 0 . 00 carat round diamond to match her old engagement_ring diamond for earrings as well as a 0 . 00 carat round diamond for her engagement_ring .
positive	both diamonds were egl , d color , si0 clarity .
positive	i couldn_'_t be_happier with the purchase .
positive	in total , i paid 00_% less_than any other diamond broker i spoke with .
positive	my wife_loves new earrings that i had made and has not taken them out .
positive	she has received many_compliments on both the earrings as well as on the engagement_ring .
positive	i will absolutely be recommending brilliance to my buddies as well as using brilliance for any future loose stone purchases that i make .
positive	the customer service was informative in describing what the stones would look like .
positive	i can say that both stones are completely colorless and look fantastic .
positive	i '_m sure that a lot of people think that i probably spent a lot of money ($ 00k +, when in fact i spent less_than half ).
positive	the joke is on them for paying too much with diamond retailers who cannot pass savings along to their customers .
positive	since i have gotten into wet_shaving i '_ve used a few local sellers and a few online .
positive	no one had the selection , price , or customer care that west_coast shaving has .
positive	i will not buy from anyone_else .
positive	i found a great deal on a storage_space , and more sizes to choose from , at sparefoot .
positive	i booked the space without paying a dime and shortly_after was contacted by the storage_facility .
positive	the whole_process was faultless .
positive	i will use them again .
positive	bought two parts over a couple of weeks from design000 .
positive	they price was good the service better , i will no_doubt use them again .
positive	best service that i could have ever expected !
positive	first_class
positive	i '_ve ordered from these_folks for the past two years and have been consistently impressed with their coffee quality as well as their responsiveness .
positive	the capsules always arrive in a timely_fashion and are inexpensive enough that i typically use two of them per cup of latte or capuccino .
positive	the early capsules were a bit stiff to puncture in my machine but the more recent capsule seal they ' re using has rectified that .
positive	they are now printing the coffee type on the capsule which is helpful .
positive	i '_m still amazed that a company based in scotland can have better response times than those of most us - based companies i '_ve experienced !
positive	i don_'_t do much online ordering .
positive	this was a bit difficult .
positive	however , you made it as pleasant as it could be .
positive	j
positive	thanks ...
positive	excellent service , order arrived next_day and hinges were perfect for the job .
positive	will_certainly use again .
positive	the right item at the right price with fast free delivery - recommend .
positive	i was really surprised how low the prices were .
positive	i was expecting to pay a good bit more for stuff i bought .
positive	it arrived a day or two earlier_than i expected as compared to other online stores .
positive	spent quite a bit of time going round asking for advice and costs for sending documents to new_zealand all i got was problems and huge price differences but with parcelhero all i got was ease of mind collection from my home on time and delivered earlier_than promised and so cheap all i can say is thanks
positive	easy , fast , liked the presence of many user reviews .

positive	global_airport_parking provides an excellent value .

positive	the transport to and from the airport is very convenient too .
positive	i use global_airport_parking because it is a great way to save_money parking my car .
positive	let_me start out by saying this was my first real experience with town_fair_tire .
positive	i have always been loyal to my local ntb tire_center , but have become increasingly more frustrated by all the constant " up selling " every time i come in for service .
positive	so when time came for new tires for my honda_odyssey , i called my local town_fair_tire ( woburn , ma ) to see if they had 0 michelin_tires in stock for my honda_odyssey .
positive	i spoke with tyler ( clerk # 000m ) who was very well_mannered and extremely_knowledgeable .
positive	he informed me the tires i wanted were not currently in stock , but would be available the next_day if i wanted to wait .
positive	he quoted me a price and we booked the appointment for the following_day .
positive	i arrived the following_day to have the tires installed along with a 0 wheel_alignment .
positive	at the same time , i informed tyler that ntb had the same tire for roughly_$_00 a tire cheaper and also included free mounting and balancing , valve_stems , flat_repair , tire_rotation , etc .
positive	tyler understood my concerns and worked up a contract with competitive_pricing to the ntb quote .
positive	the savings wasn_'_t dramatic ($ 0 . 00 per wheel ), but the fact that he was willing to work with me was greatly_appreciated .
positive	currently waiting for the tires to be installed and wanted to pass along thanks to tyler and the folks at town_fair_tire for a great first experience .
positive	sincerely ,
positive	rich a - reading , ma
positive	great job .
positive	no_problems at all getting what i expected .

positive	it was with trepidation that we booked and paid for our car with this company !
positive	it seemed too good to be true .
positive	we read the reviews by others on tripadvisor and it seemed there were a few problems ., i called the office in sydney and very bluntly asked " why it was so cheap " the girl was lovely and explained the cars were two years old and under a bulk contract to australians !
positive	as it included all costs and there were to be no extra surprises when we arrived we went_ahead .
positive	we had a little fear after we booked that it may be difficult to take the car into canada but after a phone_call that seemed to be no problem either !
positive	we have rented_cars in usa previously and while they seem cheap online it is when you pick the car up that the extra deductibles and waivers are added .
positive	sometimes it is $ 0000 !
positive	it was amazing when we called the shuttle_bus in la ...... easy .... arrived quickly and drove us to the alamo office .
positive	not a problem with paperwork and we were out of the office in five_minutes with directions of " go over to aisle 0 and pick whichever car you would like " .
positive	we had chosen a jeep because it was about $_000 cheaper_than a ford_escape but when we got to the aisle there was no jeep there and we had to double_check with the office that it was alright to take the more_expensive ford .
positive	not a problem ..... take which ever you want !"
positive	all cars had a key in the lock so we selected a brand_new ford_escape that had done 0000 miles and drove off .
positive	i cannot recommend the experience highly_enough !
positive	the car was wonderful .
positive	we drove 0000miles in 00 days and had no_problems !
positive	we brought it back 0 hours late , as arranged , and were charged $_00 per hour , as arranged !
positive	using this company as aussies was easy painless and at_least $ 0000 cheaper_than straight from the rental_companies as everything was included .
positive	we were extremely happy with the whole_process .
positive	thankyou driveaway !
positive	b_&_h is a terrific place to find all of your photo needs .

positive	very impressed with customer service here .
positive	item was ' self assembly ' but easy to put_together , in around 00_minutes , it saves time to use a electric screw - driver , with a low torque setting and allen bit , rather_than the allen key provided in the pack .
positive	at this price one would not expect a rolls royce quality but , in reality , the construction seems well_designed and the materials of sound quality .
positive	too early to comment on durability but chair is comfortable and adjusts to a range of individual preferences .
positive	was impressed with the firms service and would certainly use again .

positive	only detraction was the next_day when i changed the oil and it was apparent the oil cartridge had not been changed for a long time ( fully packed with sludge ), air_filter had not been changed and the cabin_air_filter had not been changed ever !
positive	if i did not work for a garage , then these items would have been over looked by the average consumer , resulting in engine damage .
positive	so you need to tighten up on vechicle inspections prior to the sale , and not totally rely_on the warrenty to fix problems .
positive	i would have been upset if i had to go without my car while you replaced the engine after a few_days .
positive	best way to buy games are more reasonable prices by_far , best cd_key shop i '_ve ever used - the auto key stuff is genius .

positive	partsgeek is almost always a one stop_shop for replacement parts with a wide_selection of different things most parts places would send you to specialty shops for .
positive	i have never gotten the wrong part from them so i can '_t speak to how well they handle any errors but the fact that after a high number of transactions i have not run_into one yet seems to speak well for the operation .
positive	i have now had extensive dealings with heinnie_haynes , and the customer service is probably the best i have ever_experienced shopping on the internet , it is a pity that more company '_s do not apply a similar dedication towards their customer service .
positive	in summary , a first_class on - line shopping_experience , long may it continue !

positive	went to buy a two seater sofa at birstsll near leeds as there are a number of furniture stores on one site .
positive	had the life harassed out of us at the first one , they were waiting like a pack when we opened the door .
positive	into the next with some_trepidation it was sofaworks .
positive	immediately could tell the difference .
positive	a welcome " hello " and an invitation to seek out any member of staff for information was all we had to contend with .
positive	unmolested tour , choice made , money paid and we were on our way .
positive	that '_s the way to buy furniture .
positive	first order of door and window handles delivered within_00hrs .
positive	quality and value were unbelievably good .
positive	so i tested them again with a repeat order so that i could complete the renewal of door and window furniture throughout the house .
positive	they came up_trumps again .
positive	once might have been good luck but twice tells_me this is normal practice .
positive	can '_t recommend them highly_enough .
positive	did the usual search_engine investigation for replacement electric_toothbrush_heads and came_across molarclean .
positive	the prices for bulk buys seemed too good to be true compared to the exhorbitant cost of manufacturer replacements .
positive	order placed , delivered a few_days_later and delighted with quality product that fitted and worked just as well as the over priced " real thing ."
positive	i now clean my teeth with a smile on my face .
positive	very reliable , right product delivered with no damage , easy access link to track your order status , delivered in the specified delivery slot !
positive	i do recommend !
positive	thank_you guys !
positive	simple ordering system , good choice of packages , and fast delivery .
positive	delivery and product exactly as_promised , it was delivered during the time_slot given , we even got a phone_call to say they were about 0 miles_away .
positive	first_impressions of the machine were disappointing as it did not come up to the drying rate of our old creda simplicity that we had previously , some of the clothes were still damp when it switched off , but then found out it was down to incorrect settings , on the second days washing it was set to the top setting and came out dry , not only dry but my wife commented that the clothes felt better and softer finish .
positive	the moral of the story is " read the instructions and understand them ".
positive	when buying from a new to you company you always hope for a good experience but rarely does the company exceed your expectations .
positive	i can say that my purchase from hudson_reed was exceptional in every way possible .
positive	i purchased online and it was quick and easy .
positive	my purchase was sent out within 00_hours and my free shipping had my purchase to me in 0 short days .
positive	what i received was exactly_what i ordered with the exception that the quality was far better_than my expectations .

positive	i placed my order with you guys 0 day after i placed one with amazon and received your package first !
positive	amazing !
positive	i will_definitely continue to give you my business as long as this outstanding speed in service keeps up , no_doubt .
positive	that '_s not even taking into account the fact that the shipping was free and you guys had the cheapest price around by a long stretch .
positive	truly , amazing .
positive	i thank_you for one of the most pleasant online transactions i '_ve had to date .
positive	stephanie stearns was fantastic from begining to end - could not have had better service .

positive	i thought i had found a better deal on another pet_food delivery site ... and they almost had me .
positive	i found the food i was looking for at what appeared to be an unbeatable price .
positive	it was a whole $_00 . 00 less_than any other site , including petflow .
positive	at_least , that '_s how it appeared until i got to the checkout .
positive	i was one click away from submitting my order when the delivery charge was first displayed .
positive	that site wanted to charge me $_00 . 00 for shipping .
positive	i went to petflow where i found the same food for $_00 . 00 more , but they only charged a flat_rate shipping fee of $ 0 . 00 if you didn_'_t qualify for the free shipping .
positive	the free shipping was on orders of $_00 . 00 or more .
positive	my order came to $_00 . 00 ... which_meant i didn_'_t qualify for the free shipping .
positive	i contacted petflow and asked if we could work something out since i was only $ 0 . 00 short of qualifying for the free shipping .
positive	the lady i worked with gave_me another code extending the free shipping to me on all repeat deliveries of the product i was ordering !
positive	in the end , petflow was $ 0 . 00 cheaper_than the other site that , at first_glance , appeared to be the best deal .
positive	petflow was also $ 0 . 00 cheaper_than my local_pet_store and there was no sales_tax which made them a total of $ 0 . 00 cheaper_than my local store !
positive	the best part was that the food arrived at my door just 0 days_later !
positive	with their superior customer service and willingness to work with their customers , petflow turned_out to be the best deal out there !!
positive	!
positive	i like the ability to clasify on rate and to open a map of the locations .

positive	the people were helpful , and the website is easy to use .
positive	really can '_t fault transferwise .
positive	i '_ve transferred a number of currencies with them and the processing time is consistently impressive .
positive	the rates after rebate are unheard of - and if the rebate process puts you off , the turnaround time for receipt is very quick .
positive	when you call their contact number there are no call centres or clueless support staff - just a team of very professional people that know their business , which is incredibly refreshing .
positive	highly_recommend these_guys .
positive	my only feedback is that i ' d like to see more currencies so that i don_'_t have to use other services !

positive	but if i did need it again or someone asked for my recommendation rev would be my first suggestion .

positive	so glad i was able to find a great selection with very low_prices .
positive	travelling to catch a flight is stressful , particularly when your route is the m0 into london .

positive	double checking flight details and timing , advising of possible alternative routes and timing and greart directions to the pickup point .
positive	result was minimal delay on arrival and able to catch an intercontinental flight - stress level dropped immediately .
positive	most online shopping with free delivery means you '_ll have to be hanging_around all day .
positive	ukmail provide a reasonable time_slot and let you know by email .
positive	very impressive !
positive	got a great price on a bike stand .
positive	it was dispatched swiftly and emails kept me up to date with the order process ... what more could i hope for !

positive	while i hoped a new side_mirror was only going to be in the $_00 range , i was prepared to find that it was a $_000 item .
positive	had i gone to a dealer for an oem mirror , i '_m sure i would have paid that much , but i was thrilled to buy what i needed from partsgeek for only $_00 , and i had it on my doorstep in less_than a week !

positive	cjs_cd_keys where the easiest , quickest and cheapest website i '_ve ever used to purchase and redeem a game , would recommend it to anyone .
positive	if you '_ve never been to london , here '_s the perfect way to see all of the popular sites to see .
positive	we purchased a two day pass so we could take our time and see as many sites as possible in a slower paced setting .
positive	big_bus_tours were awesome .
positive	if you wanted to see a specific place , just hop_off , go visit , then hop back on when you ' re ready to go see another site .
positive	we liked the " red " tour_bus because you have a live_person giving you information about the city and it '_s famous spots .
positive	it made it more personable than the " blue " tour where you get headsets to listen to .
positive	both were great , but we enjoyed the " red " tour better .
positive	had a great time !
positive	will_definitely us them again to get around the city .
positive	crutchfield delivered exactly_what they promised .
positive	great service .

positive	i am very satisfied with the product , the promptness of service and delivery ( international ), and the security of online shopping photonlight . com has provided .
positive	however , one of the two identical product i purchased seem noticeably dimmer than the other .
positive	i assume this is due to the freshness of the battery installed , and certainly hoping not because of a faulty / worn - out bulb .
positive	nevertheless , satisfaction sure is guaranteed .

positive	paying was even easier .
positive	have already_recommended rightchannel to people !
positive	order junior squash shoe for son , product arrived next_day , which saved me no end of harassment off son .
positive	excellent service .
positive	initially , the prices drew me to selectspecs .
positive	my very first pair ( rimless , lightweight polycarbonate , uv protected ) were a mere £_00 .
positive	and i far preferred them to my old store bought £_000 pair .
positive	so , when the time came for a newer pair , selectspecs was the only place i ' d consider .
positive	the choice is tremendous , even including designer names if i wanted them .
positive	and as affordable as the lower range is , nothing is of poor quality ( i know , cause i '_ve bought three pairs so_far ).
positive	also , no need to worry_about the whole selection process ( entering prescription , working out " pd ", frame measurements ), it isn_'_t as daunting as you might think .
positive	everything is clearly_explained at each_step .
positive	i feel i '_m being treated by my very own optician .
positive	but what i really love is this ; wearing my shiny smart specs for the first time , & saying to my friends : " guess how much i paid for these !"
positive	i went in with a few laptop problems and they were sorted within a day .
positive	very cost_effective .
positive	been a first time customer , i did not know what to expect .
positive	i must_say that my part order from eeuroparts did meet my expectations in regards of correct items packed well and delivered on time .
positive	i bought an 0gb additional ram for my laptop , it arrived on time and i install it to my machine .
positive	it worked_perfectly .
positive	i highly_recommend offtek to everybody who are looking to buy additional ram to laptops .
positive	my shower '_s prv burst due to a kink in the shower_hose .
positive	i went online to shower_doctor and ordered the parts , also read some answers on the faqs on how to repair shower .

positive	will do_business with them again .
positive	i bought an_engagement_ring from brilliance in late october .
positive	i made the purchase online rather blindly ( as i did not know too much about diamonds ).
positive	i instantly got a call from one of the girls in customer service , letting_me know that she did not think the diamond i selected was a great fit for the ring .
positive	for about 00 - 00_minutes , she took the time to educate me on all the standard criteria for diamonds and gave_me many different options .
positive	i picked out a diamond based on her recommendation and she literally put me on hold , called the diamond supplier , inspected the ring and got back to me within minutes .
positive	the first time she did this , she didn_'_t have faith in the supplier because he couldn_'_t provide a picture and then went to the next option .
positive	she did the same process and indicated the diamond looked and sounded good .
positive	i made the purchase , got the ring and proposed .
positive	my fiance accepted , but i found out i had the wrong ring size .
positive	due to wanting to have the ring for the holidays , we took it to a jewelry shop to get resized .
positive	everyone that looked at the ring gave it very high praises and were really impressed .
positive	brilliance is a top_notch organization and makes it really easy for those less knowledgable about jewelry .
positive	i got my key_instantly after paying with moneybookers ( as_advertised ).
positive	i had no_issues with cjs_cd_keys service !
positive	great customer service .
positive	i will never travel on an airplane again with my golf_bag .
positive	the ship_sticks team is incredible and completely dedicated .
positive	love it .
positive	i have jim murray '_s bible on my ipad and combining his reviews with what i already know i then looked at the exchange '_s website - and some others of course .
positive	i think i found all the whiskies i was interested in and most were reasonably within my budget .
positive	incidently , it '_s the best website for whiskies i found .
positive	however , i '_m not fond of delivery charges - which is why i use amazon so much and without them i think i would use the site more often rather_than leaving it till i had a largish order - i reckon i would buy more .
positive	i also wondered how one gets a discount , i saw where you could enter a voucher_code ; i think i '_ve spent enough to merit one .
positive	but overall if you are interested in single_malts and in whiskies from around the world the whisky_exchange is a great company to use .
positive	i brought my cloudstix e_- cigeratte to help break the habit .
positive	i ordered next_day delievery and cloud stix lived_up to that .
positive	unfortunatelly royal_mail failed to deliever as they said they couldnt gain_access to my flat .
positive	cloudstix rang me to tell me what had happened .
positive	so the blame is with royal_mail .
positive	anyway after smoking 00 a day i have immediately cut down to none !
positive	i have been smoke free for four days and dont even wish for a normal cigerette .
positive	i would recomend this company to anyone .
positive	ordered a raspberry_pi b kit ( power , sd_card w_/ os , and case ).

positive	ordered part easily .
positive	quick processing and delivery .
positive	shipping was way cheaper_than most other_sites i checked out .
positive	i have yet to use the pump , but it is well reviewed and award winning .

positive	have not had any_problems with ink for my epson xp000 printers and saves a lot of money over the oem cartridges .
positive	i had never_heard of this service so when i was booking the tyres replacement it was a surprise that they could be fitted using a mobile service .
positive	although i have ordered the right size of tyres the load was the wrong one .
positive	also kwik_fit has brought a wrong_size of tyre .
positive	this was a bit of an inconvenience but we just booked it to the next_day with no_fuss .
positive	very professional !
positive	very good service
positive	i don_'_t trust very many sites but i would recommend partsgeek and i will use them again .

positive	appliance_online offered the combination of best price and free ( eco ) delivery for my new neff built - under fridge .
positive	i was kept_informed of progress towards delivery including a three hour_window on delivery day .
positive	the item arrived in original packaging and in perfect_condition together with friendly advice to leave for 0 hours before switching on .
positive	the item worked_perfectly when powered up .
positive	this company is highly_recommended .
positive	i live on continental_europe , which has a lower quality and diversity of training supplements than in north_america and the uk .
positive	i buy from bulkpowders . co . uk , because their prices are good , the value of the supplements are high , and there '_s free delivery to a number of eu countries with purchases over £_000 .
positive	even large deliveries to eu countries are sent by courier ( dpd ).
positive	i have never had a delivery from bulkpowders . co . uk lost or delayed .
positive	always happy shopping at b_&_h

positive	excellent service and fast delivery .
positive	it arrived in two_days , packed safely , and at a good price . it is hard to find at times around here ( there is one store i wll not shop in ), so it '_s convenient to have it show up on your doorstep , saving on gas also . they also have great customer service , talked w_/ alexandria a couple of times she was very helpful .
positive	i ordered both knives and received a prompt reply confirming my order and they were delivered only a few_days_later much sooner_than i expected .
positive	i '_ve previously ordered knives from a different website who i had nothing but issues with so i can '_t recommend heinnie_haynes high enough .
positive	very good service , price and shipping
positive	enjoyed your great service and all parts fit perfect and nothing was returned .
positive	one improvement wish you had , torque values .
positive	simply love this company !
positive	i had a great experience at town_fair_tire all because of rick !

positive	i was comfortable in the waiting room and didn_'_t have to wait long to be on my way .
positive	rick has made me a town_fair_tire customer for life !
positive	thanks rick !
positive	!
positive	i value hostelworld because it is making it easy for me to book hostels for several reasons .
positive	first , i appreciate the reviews of other guests which in almost any case is a reliable indicator of the actual quality .
positive	second , the design of the website is appealing and it '_s intuitively understandable .
positive	lastly , as it is a major hostel website , almost any hostel that exists is actually listed on this website .
positive	downside is the search_function .
positive	if i search for single rooms , i see prices that per person that look cheap .
positive	however , when i select it , it sometimes requires 0 + people in the room .
positive	for example , hostelworld shows a single room for usd 00 .
positive	then i select it and it asks for usd 00 because min .
positive	0 person stay / room .
positive	they should show usd 00 instead .
positive	but all in all great !
positive	keep on the good work , hostelworld !
positive	availability of merchandise and on time prossesing .
positive	we would use this service again .
positive	when traveling , hostelworld . com is always the first place i go to obtain reviews for hostel availability due to their up to date reviews .

positive	great screens , great service , fast shipping and the tutorials are spot on !!
positive	!
positive	we are doing a complete gut - rehab of our master bath .

positive	this was my second purchase .
positive	i thought this one would be more difficult to fulfill as most garages in my area did not have a space saver in stock .
positive	thanks to blackcircles i had a new spacesaver tyre fitted within 00_hours and at a very competetive price ...
positive	i would definitly recommend this company .
positive	a very good delivery and product service
positive	i used to be the guy_who would look to gnc for my supplements .
positive	it seemed like every time i would walk into that store they were telling_me it was time to renew my fifteen dollar gold_card .
positive	the thing about their " gold_card " was that the prices on their product were so over priced that it actually made it seem like you were getting a good deal .
positive	one day , for whatever the reason , i got online just to look up some reviews for supplements and happened to stumble upon supplementwarehouse . com .
positive	i quickly was able to use their search box to find exactly_what i was looking for , and could not believe my eyes when i saw the prices that were listed for the supplements .
positive	i had never realized that i was paying up tp 00 and 00 dollars more at gnc !
positive	not only do they have the cheapest prices , but they offer you free_samples of new supplements as well as give away some that might be only a few weeks old , at no cost .
positive	i am on supplementwarehouse at_least once a month and refuse to go to any other website or store .
positive	supplementwarehouse is hands_down the best place to find the exact supplement you are looking for , and pay the lowest proce to get it .
positive	i encourage_anyone that may use a different site or even a store to check supplementwarehouse out for themselves to find what everyone_else on their site is enjoying .
positive	recently visited edinburgh but was unable to locate the single_malt whisky i prefer .
positive	looked online when i returned home and it was available at whisky_exchange .

positive	i have been purchasing parts from partsgeek for a number of years and i have found them to be very competent and their customer service has_been exceptional .
positive	every part that i have requested has_been the correct part .
positive	i made the mistake once of buying parts from another supplier because they were less_expensive but that was a big mistake .
positive	stick with partsgeek and you wont go_wrong .
positive	i '_ve ordered from stg a number of times over the past 0 to 0 - 0 / 0 years .

positive	returning it and getting the replacement went even smoother than they advertise .
positive	i '_ve since ordered a number of other times and all i can say is , there '_s no reason to shop around even .
positive	now i just go to them and order .
positive	even if their price was a bit higher ( which it '_s usually better or the same ) i would still buy from them just because confidence is worth something to me .

positive	it has what i need .
positive	when my local gym started raising the prices of the supplements i was buying from them , i became curious as to what price others were selling the same products .
positive	i went to gnc and checked their prices to find that they were as expensive , if not more_expensive , than my local gym .
positive	i had decided i would just buy from the gym until i ran_across an advertisement for the supplement_warehouse .
positive	their pricing was almost_half of what both the gym and gnc were charging .
positive	i '_m no genius , ( haha , i '_m a lifter , remember ) but i figured there had to be a catch .
positive	however , for these prices , i was going to see for myself if it was real or not .
positive	after my first order i was convinced i had found the real deal ; even more when i got free trials of products and a muscle and fitness_magazine to boot .
positive	i love this place and will_continue to be a customer unless the government puts free enterprise out of business .
positive	let '_s roll entrepreneurs .
positive	keep america free , god fearing , and strong !!!
positive	!
positive	the title_says it all , the new shifters i bought were a good 00_% cheaper_than the sale price on another popular cycle website , the product was in stock , i ordered on a sunday_afternoon and it was on my doorstep by 0 :_00am tuesday .
positive	fantastic service def be using again in the future .
positive	i can '_t wait to use the honey i purchased along with the shaker_bottle from onnit .
positive	i ordered on monday and fedex arrived thursday , but they had sent windows_xp pro instead .
positive	a quick call and the saleslady said she would take_care of it .
positive	the following_tuesday fedex arrived with the correct product .
positive	i would recommend this product as well as capital pc
positive	it was easy to use , and we got 0_star accommodations at 0 - 0_star prices .
positive	i had " beast mode " done in 0 " lettering .
positive	they were fast and very professional .
positive	if you need anything give them a shot .
positive	i will use them again .

positive	i was very hesitant about finding a reputable online pharmacy .
positive	after many many attempts on locating one , i came_across access rx , and i gave them a try .
positive	the word " pleased " cannot describe my experience .
positive	.. much_better , in fact .
positive	the customer service representive and the medical staff were friendly and efficient .
positive	i was obtaining a prescription for calais and did not have my own doctor .
positive	i didn_'_t feel in any way uncomfortable , rushed or like i was doimg or dealing_with anything shady .
positive	my medication arrived exactly when they said it would .
positive	the refill process is easy .
positive	i am very happy with this company and will_continue to use them .
positive	the only_drawback i can mention is that the medication is a bit_pricey but it includes the prescription and the consultation .
positive	access rx is professional , efficient and certainly reputable .
positive	i highly rrecommend !
positive	***** rating
positive	had an issue with my glasses , but they fixed it and communicated very well .

positive	we requested a small station_wagon in order to accommodate 0 passengers with luggage .
positive	we were offered a brand_new renault station_wagon with only 0 killometers on it .
positive	the car performed_flawlessly as we drove it through spain , france , italy .
positive	we put a total of 0000 killometers ( 0000 miles ) on the vehicle in two_weeks .
positive	it used diesel fuel and averaged 00 miles per_gallon .
positive	needless to say , we were thriled and highly_recommend renting a vehicle utilizing auto_europe .
positive	we will rent again from auto_europe in the future .
positive	great company !
positive	great products and super service !
positive	thanks again tapeonine !
positive	i enjoy_shopping online with b_&_h because it is easy as well as quick and convenient .
positive	i also know if i have questions , the answer is only a phone_call away .
positive	geen tegenvallers gehad , het licht de service alles voldoet aan_de verwachtingen ga zo door
positive	i am a fan of the easyclip brand and i have been using them for years .
positive	frames_direct has a great selection of these and this is the second time i buy from them .
positive	this time was the best because they have a style that doesn_'_t follow the trend of smaller frames !
positive	i got some old_fashioned ray_ban style and ordered them on discount .
positive	fast shipping and processing and great customer service !
positive	i recommend everyone to buy frames here .
positive	i order material from these_guys .
positive	like the 0 - liner says ... great prices , great delivery lead - times , great service .
positive	top_notch company here .
positive	i received the correct part in 0 days , no_hassle , no_issues .
positive	i have been very pleasd with the quality of all the 00x00 and 00x00 artwork i have bought ( several ) and , when framed , in the quality and workmanship of the framing .
positive	i tried one of the budget items for a less important location , and must_say it was of decidedly lower quality .
positive	i would never buy another .
positive	on the other hand , i have bought a few 0x00 '_s which were not advertised as economy but which turned_out to be lacking in any depth of paint just as was the larger item .
positive	i don_'_t think the 0x00 '_s are any bargain at full price but on sale may be worth a look for a special spot .. frames have all been very good but occasionally the stretching could be tighter to match my preference .
positive	all in all , a good source but could use a wider choice of artists .
positive	i have installed two of these packages from costco , one for me and one for my sister - in - law .
positive	the second installation went very smoothly .
positive	i had a few problems with the first though .
positive	the z wave lamp modules would not connect with the 0 gig controller and i had to have them replaced .
positive	i also had to replace one of the door window sensors which had a broken case when it arrived .
positive	with the door window sensor replacement i was given the instruction_sheet on how to program it into the 0 gig controller .
positive	which by the way they do not send the programming sheet for the sensors since they pre install them before they send you the package .
positive	at_least now i have the programming instructions for the door window sensors if i decide to change any parameters such as entry alarm delay etc .
positive	in the program .
positive	that is my one and only_gripe about this system is they do not send the actual programming instructions for all the devices .
positive	maybe its proprietary or something and they have their reasons i guess .
positive	overall it is a very good system and we have already set off the alarms inadvertently and had the local sheriff show up twice to our house .
positive	it does help to remember to you now have a security_system that will call law_enforcement for you when you forget to disarm the system .
positive	the automation devices are great and i love the fact that i now have an alarm that will call the fire department when the smoke detector goes off when i am away from home .
positive	this method of transferring_money is the best on the market .
positive	ignore the banks and their extortionate rates
positive	only 00 cars , very few slow cars and all well driven after the very good briefing .
positive	i '_ve heard it so many_times but the bookatrack guy is a very good presenter of this stuff and it shows on the track compared to other trackday co . s rambling " umm guys " stuff .
positive	always a well run day and an excellent web_site , well_worth the extra few_quid
positive	just used tyre_shopper for the first time .
positive	saved a significant_amount of money on my tyres and believe it or not they will be fitted at the same local_garage i used last_year .
positive	the tyres form my original order were unavailable but a customer_services reprsentative managed to offer me an upgraded tyre from the same manufacturer at no exttra charge .
positive	goods ordered were received within 00_hours and gave a considerable saving on showroom prices
positive	easy to use website .
positive	goods despatched quickly and saved myself money as well .
positive	first rate , next_day service .
positive	can '_t ask for more .
positive	i recieved my order quicker_than_expected so i was not in when the delivery arrived but the driver concealed the parcel and put a card through the door pointing_out where it was .
positive	the leather cleaner i ordered was used on saturday and as_advertised it left no white residue , the seats were as i remembered them when i purchaced the car .
positive	great
positive	i always look at parts_geek first .
positive	second time buying my psn_card here , never had a problem .
positive	the code came in less_than five_minutes after purchasing .
positive	i hired a nikon 00 - 000 f0 . 0 and teleconverter for a week .
positive	online booking process was very straightforward and delivery within the timeframe i requested .
positive	items in perfect_condition .
positive	i would prefer that lenses for hire sort out the collection process rather_than have to arrange myself and i don_'_t really understand_why there is an extra change to have their couriers to collect it .
positive	jca subcontracted to citylink anyway but these are small gripes and providing you ' re aware of them i would have no_hesitation at all in recommending them .
positive	i '_ll certainly use them again .
positive	i was a bit_dubious at first , but after 0 separate purchases and zero hassles , i '_ll be back .
positive	great pricing as well .
positive	same as above .
positive	the machine was a personal build and has_been excellent in its first week .
positive	not impressed by windows0 though .
positive	i would recommend this company to anyone with a need to replace their phone glass .
positive	i think you need to check out partsgeek now !

positive	if you miss the pre_- order dlc it '_s a great way to still get it on a budget !
positive	a comprehensive_range of products and first_class service .
positive	i shall_certainly use these_people again .
positive	very prompt and reasonably_priced service even for a relatively_small order value .
positive	an extremely wide_range of writing_materials at reasonable prices and from my experiences a fast service .
positive	i didn_'_t want next_day delivery so opted out of paying an extra £_00 .
positive	result , it arrived at 00 : 00 the next_day .
positive	fantastic but who is ripping off tv village customers with this £_00 option ?
positive	i have used usn diet fuel for a long time , but have always wondered_why it never came in a larger container .
positive	thanks to an_email from musclefiness , i saw the 0 kg container .

positive	the delivery too was prompt and delivered to work .
positive	a first_class service from a top company !
positive	thanks

positive	i will use them again .
positive	thank_you cult_pens !

positive	thank_goodness we can keep toastie this winter with a little l £$$ concern !
positive	knowing where exactly to meet the guys at birmingham_airport seemed a bit of a lottery until you found there was only one large light post in the drop_off zone .
positive	paper_work was well_organised for departure and return . getting the car back was stress_free .
positive	i '_ll be using the guys again .
positive	the only_slight_issue i had was that they ' re not insured to have on them / in their office any other keys but the car key , so was surprised the other keys were in the car .
positive	our experience with doheny has_been nothing_short of outstanding !
positive	good prices and prompt deliveries make ordering non_- threating .
positive	great service thanks
positive	you drop your car off directly outside the departure terminal and the chauffeur deals with the drop_off in moments leaving you to get checked in .
positive	there '_s none of this parking miles_away and then waiting for shuttle_buses which adds to your time and is the last thing you want on your return trip and just want to get home .
positive	highly_recommended hassle_free airport_parking .
positive	i wouldn_'_t use any other now .
positive	our ruvati sink and faucet combo not only exceeded our expectations , but the customer service provided by mainfaucet was superb !

positive	i was able to order my fifth_wheel hitch easily .
positive	i had a question about the rails when the packages arrived so i called american_rv and got my answer .
positive	however , a few_days_later , someone called me to verify everything was good with my shipment which was nice .
positive	the reese hitch price was cheaper_than anyone_else and included free shipping which was surprising since it weighed over 000_lbs .
positive	all the right pieces were there and the hitch is installed just in time to go pickup the new rv .
positive	very good experience and will use american_rv again in the future .
positive	the clutch i bought came with everything , i thought it didn_'_t come with a slave_cylinder but it did .
positive	parts_geeks price was 000_dollars cheaper_than advance_auto and i have a discount cuz i work there .
positive	shipping was easy to track also
positive	everything but the website search is as good as it gets .
positive	merlin_cycles has some of the best prices i have found .
positive	the service is great & the delivery of parts was very fast .

positive	our electrician only got round to installing them last_week and realised that one of them had been broken in transit .
positive	as this was well outside the time limit for returns i assumed that i would be told that there was nothing they could do , fortunately they have refunded the cost of the original light and the replacement arrived within 00_hours of ordering .
positive	thankyou and well_done castlegatelights
positive	i purchased apair of glasses from selectspecs in febuary this year .
positive	unfortunately in september one of the arms snapped_off , on contacting the company and after sending them a photo of the broken glasses thay agreed to provide me a new pair of the same glasses .

positive	full instructions and easy transaction .
positive	i experienced an all_round shopping_experience on - line .
positive	after browsing gak '_s excellent , comprehensive and competitively_priced website and finding what i thought i needed , i really required further information and reassurance before my final purchase decision .
positive	as i was busy at the time it suited me to communicate via_email rather_than pick - up the telephone .
positive	i therefore expected a delay before a response back , but low and behold my questions and queries were fully answered in an_email within the hour .
positive	i duly completed my final purchase via the telephone and found richard to be very friendly , polite , knowledgeable and helpful , i was truly treated as a real customer .... unfortunately , something that is not always experienced in retailing these days !

positive	in the wake of online shopping all over the world , businesses have taken their business online and are looking for all possible strategies and techniques of marketing .
positive	one of the well established strategies of marketing your business and its products and services is by devising the strategies on how to get more twitter_followers because that is a show of superiority of your business and it offers you an opportunity to communicate with a large number of the target audience easily .
positive	that amount of influence you have over the internet is directly proportional and related to how many twitter_followers you have .
positive	bigger influence means more clients , more sales and increased profits in the ultimate which is the target of every business .
positive	the normal traditional business is still prevalent and more sophisticated at the moment as businesses try to outsmart each other in terms of the number of twitter_followers .
positive	all the techniques and strategies are applied and you are free to buy twitter_followers to increase your business following .
positive	you may as well buy the followers but the trick is very simple as you will learn after_reading the following few paragraphs
positive	there are several companies which the twitter_followers are ‘ purchased ’; just type the words ‘ buy more twitter_followers ’ in your browser and you will be offered several to choose from .
positive	you must go further and establish the legitimacy of any company before you enter in to any deal because you may be scammed .
positive	this is an expensive venture and some companies charge up to and even more than $_000 for every 0 , 000 followers .
positive	others charge $_000 for 00 , 000 followers so you should compare the various companies and select that which charges reasonable prices .
positive	you should read the profile of every company to see how many followers it is capable of generating within certain duration .
positive	this therefore means that you should not just select the cheapest priced one because it may not be capable of generating g the desired number of followers at all or within the desired time frame .
positive	to get anything of value , you must be prepared to spend .
positive	it may be seen as expensive to get more twitter_followers , but it pays in the ultimate with increased traffic you your website , increased sales and generally and becoming more popular and familiar online .
positive	when your website becomes popular , you can get unbelievably huge sums of money for ads and affiliate programs .
positive	you have maintained a high_level of quality each time i '_ve ordered your product .
positive	i also love your packaging .
positive	neat touch !!
positive	!

positive	priceline is the one site you can_count on to get a deal when you forgot to book or didn_'_t know exactly where you would end up for the night .
positive	as a business traveler who plans road trips consisting of week long jaunts , often i find myself driving until my eyes can no_longer focus on the road .
positive	while most travel sites will not allow you to make last second reservations , priceline often will not only take the reservation , but give me a great price on top of it .
positive	tout_est dans_le titre !
positive	i had a problem with my on line paymement service ( french banks are some sort of north korean administrations , and they don_'_t want you to spend your money ...) i had to call the service to find a way .
positive	barbara was absolutely perfect , professionnal , patient and serviceable .
positive	she solved my problem in three phone_calls and sent me my items immediatly .
positive	great service .
positive	worth 0_stars .
positive	b_&_h_carries virtually everything !
positive	the selection is huge .
positive	they are rarely out of stock .
positive	and the prices are unbeatable .
positive	shipping is quick , but i '_m in nh , so ny is not far away .
positive	can '_t speak for you folks on the west_coast .
positive	very rarely used phone support , but they ' re very friendly and helpful .
positive	i wish i lived close enough to the city to go in and thank them , in person , for their selection , service , and price .
positive	the only_drawback is that they ' re closed for ordering during the jewish shabbat , so ordering from sundown friday to sundown saturday is not possible , but that '_s a small price to pay for what you get from b_&_h .
positive	everything i order is shipped in time to arrive on release day , most things shipped within 0 minutes of my ordering them - never had a problem with an order and nearly always find that they are cheaper on new_releases than most other_sites .
positive	great products , great prices and free shipping .
positive	couldn_'_t ask for anything more
positive	🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟
positive	when you buy from partsgeek your going to be shocked at their pricing .
positive	i just bought an expansion_tank for my chevy_truck , had i bought it from a chevy dealer , i would have paid 0 times what partsgeek charged me .
positive	on top of that the , part was of good quality .
positive	i had them ship it regular mail and it arrived in four days with no shipping cost .
positive	i '_ve had nothing but great service and no_problems .
positive	everything up to now has_been exactly_what i ordered .
positive	0st time renting here and outside of the airport_terminal . but it was surprisingly convenient .
positive	specially when they let_me know return my car to the airport public parking_lot , due to my early flight .
positive	i woud definite come_back !
positive	you need to get your printer_ink from inkfarm . com .
positive	you will not believe_how fast it arrives .
positive	i live 0 , 000_miles from its shipping point and the first time i ordered , i had it the next_day .

positive	the shipment tracking_system is great .
positive	fascinating to watch the route it takes .

positive	this has to be the best company out there for tyres .
positive	i '_ve used them twice for tyres all_round on my work vehicle and car , and both_times i '_ve bought 0 tyres for the price it would cost me for 0 elsewhere .
positive	simply look on the internet for the best rated tyres for your vehicle , and then look on blackcircles . com for the tyres .
positive	they then send the tyres to a local_garage near you who '_ll contact you with a time to fit them while you wait , it '_s so easy .
positive	i '_ve used tim allsop motor engineers in bridlington , who were absolutely_brilliant .
positive	undercuts high_street main players by a significant_amount over the year .

positive	this is a no lose situation .
positive	so_far very good
positive	easy web navigation , accurate parts description , fast shipping , very easy to do_business with .
positive	i '_ve bought my supplements from supplement_warehouse as long as i planned ahead for what i need .
positive	overall great service and quick delivery once i '_ve ordered the products .
positive	keeping it short and simple , supplements warehouse is the place to go and a great company you can trust .
positive	good price and service exactly as_advertised
positive	what more can you ask for ?
positive	very good site with quick delivery .
positive	i would recommend b_&_h to my friends
positive	took no time at all to find what i needed , add it to the cart and check out .
positive	less_than 0 minutes !
positive	plus i love having the variable and reasonably_priced shipping options .
positive	after moving to united_states i needed to bootstrap my account here and with transferwise i was able to do so relatively cheaply .
positive	running a small business is not easy , but using stamps . com for over 0 years has increased productivity and drastically reduced the number of trips we have to make to the post_office .
positive	we don_'_t have to worry_about when we pack items to ship .
positive	we jsut do it and they come to us , rather_than us going to them .
positive	great service !
positive	long time user , have had no_issues .
positive	would recommend to family , friend , anyone
positive	for anyone_who has ever lost their golf_bag or had it show up late , and never wants to worry_about that again - this is the perfect solution .
positive	took five_minutes to setup online , and they took_care of the rest .
positive	i '_ve used flubit several_times now to buy items , and i '_ve had a great shopping_experience with them .
positive	they always give you their cheaper offers within 00_hours of demanding them , as_promised , and i '_ve always received my items very promptly after ordering !
positive	in fact , when i pre_- ordered one item from them , i received it several days before_release_date !
positive	great customer service , great savings , and great delivery !
positive	a no_brainer for those_who want to save_money online !
positive	great price and even better service , my code was emailed to me within_seconds of hitting the pay button .
positive	worked a treat !
positive	will buy from here again !
positive	it '_s a great website , dispatched quickly and my order arrived on the release_date for no extra_cost .
positive	prices tend to be pretty competitive too .
positive	highly_recommended !
positive	great stuff .
positive	splendid service from anchor_pumps ruined by the attitude of the delivery driver brian of dpd who would not know a customer if he fell over one !!
positive	!
positive	this is the place to go for flowers in london
positive	used this service to send small parcel to another uk address .
positive	everything_went well , collected and delivered as_promised and confirmation_emails sent right_away .
positive	i think this company communicates well .
positive	it quickly fairly dealt_with a problem i had with a purchase ( colour not as ordered ).
positive	this is the mark of a good company .
positive	i had to cancel an order for a wash machine almost_immediately after it was placed .
positive	cancellation_policy is very clearly_stated in terms and conditions and in my opinion somewhat unusually it fully recognises customers rights under the relevant legislation .
positive	item wasn_'_t delivered and a full_refund made , all without hassle .
positive	got a fist time order pack .
positive	included two hereford ribeye steaks .
positive	the pack ( it was an introductory offer ) was very good value .
positive	it arrived in on time , was well_packed ; and very fresh .
positive	the items we have used seem to be good quality .
positive	we bought the pack primarily to try the steaks and i have to say they very good and away above_average .
positive	will consider buying the steaks again but will need to spend some time whether they are significantly_less_expensive than what can be got from supermarkets or our local butchers as westin_gourmet claims ..
positive	however i have no_doubt bout the the quality and providence of the meat .
positive	bought neff fridge_freezer .
positive	best price i could find and deivered on time within a pre_- arranged time_slot
positive	part fit right just as_described would use this company again
positive	i was pleased with the silver_shuttle service that i had during my recent_trip to london .

positive	we have ordered 0 - 0 times now and always receive great customer service and quick delivery .
positive	the quick delivery is important as we are ordering for our 00 year_old son and sometimes forget to get the order in on time !
positive	they do not sell anything like this in the stores .
positive	our extra large outdoor bean_bag arrived after being tarcked across txt and email - keeping us up to date on the delivery window .
positive	the bag is excellent quality ( strong water resistant outer ) in a lovely green .
positive	bags of beans in seperate bags to go with it .
positive	superlative service from start to finish .
positive	having previously bought another elliptical , which i returned , less_than three months after i bought it , i shopped_around for a replacement .

positive	she offered me the next level up with a deal i couldn_'_t refuse .
positive	the spirit xe000 was delivered within a week of purchase .
positive	great machine , a little more than i wanted to pay , but no_regrets , and no_hesitation in recommending new level .
positive	although an initial problem in paying for my goods , it was quickly resolved .
positive	goods arrived swiftly .
positive	easy business , if only others could be as efficient .
positive	i ordered online and was very impressed with the service and packaging .
positive	the service was just as good as the clothes .
positive	booking was easy , with clear_instructions .
positive	i liked the way the rep when called knew who i was straight_away from my number coming up .
positive	a small point but little things make a difference as a customer .
positive	car was ready at pickup point at terminal 0 and it literally took minutes to get on our way home .
positive	have used you before and would use again .
positive	thanks
positive	easy site no_hassles
positive	hopefully the print at home tickets will work once we get to paris .
positive	reservation was easy .
positive	hope the hotel experience is just as good .

positive	shipping is fast and efficient .
positive	website was very good to use and online_chat with someone at muubaa was very effecient .
positive	the product looks lovely , very well_packaged and presented , looks_like a high end product .
positive	trust and certainty are indispensable necessities when doing photo business long_distance .
positive	this company makes it unnecessary for a credit_card extra guarantee or any other separate insurance_coverage .
positive	it is no_hassle comfortable buying .
positive	best price i could find for a ford_focus fan_assembly .
positive	ordered and received the part in record time .
positive	shipping is more reasonable than most .

positive	0000_rpm .
positive	my experience over the past four years when purchasing inks has_been first_class .
positive	also your web_page is one of the best that i have used .
positive	---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
positive	however , this is not a problem of yours but , of the ink_cartridge manufacturer .
positive	i have found that the cartridges supplied for my epsom stylus sx000w printer are tight in the printer holder and do require the sides of the cartridges to be sanded to make them fit !
positive	simply the best .
positive	more people should be aware of your service ( s ).
positive	i recommend it

positive	i had a service before id_guard it was " myfico " while i was not completely happy it still gave_me information i wanted but then id_guard came along and at first i was not sure .
positive	i started with just the free_trial and before long i found that id_guard has to be the best service out there among all the others .
positive	after i set my alerts nothing will go thru without me knowing about it and it also protects from out of the ordinary charges with out me knowing about it .
positive	it won_'_t stop it but will tell me soon enough that i cane call the bank and report it .
positive	good job idguard !
positive	pat yourself on the shoulder .

positive	thanks dyers .
positive	their products such as the kettlebell , steel_clubs , and steel_mace are of high_quality though they need to keep_up with supply and demand .
positive	their kettlebells are not from the ordinary , the zombie and monkey molded kettlebell going from 0 / 0 pood to 0 pood is a great product to add to your kettlebell collection .
positive	not to mention the testimonials and workouts shown for each equipment sold is of great help to the buyer to see if he / she wants the product based on its use . the shipping is fair and on time with no trouble with the packaging .
positive	i highly_recommend purchasing from this site .

positive	i have tried the other well_known online veterinary sites and they do not even come_close , even after their coupons or deals to the everyday deals at vetapprovedrx .
positive	they are so quick to deliver and make all the necessary contacts for your pets needs .
positive	i am so fortunate to have run across this establishment during my internet search , now i do not have to continually search for the best deals or get hooked into in - store savings or coupons .

positive	will be buying more keys for cjs n the mere future
positive	booking & paying on line was really easy .

positive	good web_site with material you need and advice you can trust , i have personally used many_times .
positive	i broke the screen on my galaxy_s0 and started the claim process .
positive	the response was that i should find a local repair place to fix it and send them a copy of the invoice .
positive	i was disappointed at first , because i wanted to just get a new phone the next_day .
positive	later i realized that by just repairing my current phone i would not have to go through the hassle of moving all my important data between devices , and i would likely have lost most of it since my screen was completely unusable .
positive	a local repair place , gophermods , fixed my phone in 00_minutes , it looks_like the day i got it !
positive	i scanned and emailed my receipt to square_trade and got a check in a week , no_bs or extra questions or trying to get out of paying the way a typical insurance company would , just the check .

positive	glad i went with these_guys .
positive	i am a continued returning customer because of the professionalism at the front_desk .
